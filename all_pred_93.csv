412722,Amandine,Yuan,amandineyuan@foxmail.com,"Hi, my name is Amandine, I’m from China. I think my best friend would say: an interesting and beautiful soul.  This is about a water bottle. The first thing that came to my mind is a bottle with a Chinese black and white landscape painting on it.   A bottle with a beautiful Chinese landscape painting on it.   Drinking this bottle of water can bring you happiness, just like you are wandering in the beautiful landscape!   Nongfushanquan (nongfu spring)   Water and water bottles.  Happy Near mountain and river  My first reaction was desert and dry air. Looking at this name, the first thing that came to my mind is a person drinking water in the desert and on the mountain.   This name is more poetic, it reminded me of some ancient Chinese poems I had learned about deserts and mountains.  I will translate it as: people are interdependent with deserts, mountains and water, we are part of the nature.   These four Chinese characters can constitute a picture, as if to describe the relationship between nature and human beings.   A painting store, a tea set store, water such as c’est bone!   Chinese style Paintings, water or tea sets.  Calm  There was a question mark appeared in my mind at first, because this is not a real phrase or word, it seems to be something made up. Then I thought maybe this is related to water, yes, water is the first thing that came to my mind.   Little water man? Little ducker?   A little lively elf made of water.   Water purifier such as 3M, or skin care products such as La Mer, or toys for kids such as LEGO.   First I would think this might be a toy store because the name sounds very cute. If not, I think it’s probably something related to water, for example, water purifier, skin care products, or water bottles.  Sad Venice  This must be a water brand! The first thing came to my mind is this water is palatable.   The water makes you more than happy!   When you really need water, like after a sporting event, a sip of water can really make you happy.   I don’t know what kind of product the names are designed for, but if I think think about names, I love the poetry of this name山漠水人 and the image it brings to me. There is much imagery beauty in the image.   I chose this one as the best name, but if it needs to match the logo, I think 水赛乐 is the best and 小水人 is the second one that fits the logo.   The slogan and picture seem to be telling us to go and enjoy the outdoor activities more. I had imagined a chinese landscape paintinh by the name, but now i understand that this water bottle can let you enjoy the pleasure of outdoor sports.   It's a cute name, the whole image is telling me that everyone needs water and you will like to drink more water with this water bottle, you would become a xiao shuiren. I still think shui sai le is a better name, this name is also good and special but it's too cute.   As i answered before, it says to me that after deinking water, let 's continue our trip to mountains and desert.   This name is the best out of the four names, it can help the company reach the above four goals except the second one. In fact, i think none of these four names can reach the second goal since all the mames includes water.   I chose  山漠水人 before because I thought this was a water company. Now i think  水赛乐 is a better name for a company has water bottle as its main products.   Use some names easy to understand, it doesn't need to directly connected the product as long as they have something in common. ",Zest,
399152,Xinyu,Cheng,maggie.cheng6@hotmail.com,"My name is Xinyu (Maggie), and I am an interior designer. My friends would describe me as a hardworking, positive and caring person  this is a beverage. compared to the last one ""little water person"" this name now incorporates elements of ""mountain"" ""happiness"" ""bottle"", this is now closer to a water brand than a skincare/wellness brand (in comparison to ""little water person"". Furthermore, it is not uncommon for Chinese water brands to incorporate ""mountain"" ideas in their advertisements.   mountain water (or springwater) happiness bottle. Again this is a direct translation   I would probably explain this in two elements, first it being a ""mountain"" water, so it probably has some sort of mineral elements in it, and its a bottle that intends to bring about happiness in some way. The idea of ""happiness"" reminds me of ""happy water"" that was quite popular a few years back in North America, the idea that the water contains some sort of special ingredient that apparently increases happiness level in the drinker. With this in mind, I may relate the ""mountain"" ""mineral"" and the ""happy water"" ideas together to introduce this brand. 
   Happy Water brand, and other waters that differentiates itself from others by the alkaline level, mineral level etc.   Water  happy mountain  This name incorporates more nature imagery with ""mountain"" and ""desert"", again the idea of ""person"" comes back, I would say this name does not roll of the tongue quite as well, and when put together it does not make sense.   mountain, desert, water, person, I am not sure how I would even tie the four elements together.   some sort of ""nature"" water, I don't know how I would logically put ""desert"" in the explanation of this meaning, as desert and water seem quite opposite of each other.   given the heavy nature imagery that has little relation to one another (eg, mountain vs desert, desert vs water; mountain and water together makes sense, I think the odd element out is desert), I am starting to move away from a ""water"" brand, more of an outdoor gear brand   outdoor sports gear  tough, emotionless, serious  name is a little strange, as it directly translates to little water person. The name does not very clearly signal what the brand is about, perhaps something related to beverages or related to hydration in some way?   little water person   I would explain it using the direct translation, little water person, since in Chinese the character for little does not necessarily always mean little in a literal sense, so I may even forgo the ""little"" and just say, water person, to make it relatable, I may use example like shark boy/ lava girl to compare to ""water person""   I can see this being a name for a hydration serum, or something related to wellness. It could also be some beverage related brand given its ""water"" context.   My first instinct would be that this is a skincare brand that focuses on hydration. Or some sort of wellness brand that aims to enhance health primarily through hydration and water.  relax/calm probably at a mall, or some sort of shopping district  The name is a little confusing, but again it is the correlation between water and happiness. 赛means to compete in chinese, in this name, the character almost acts as a cohesive that combines the idea of water and happiness together   water competes happiness/ water that brings happiness   I would explain it as water that brings joy   it came down to 小水人 vs 山水悦瓶，i ended up choosing the former over the latter because the latter is overdone (the idea of water from the mountain), I would say 小水人is overall more general and could apply to different kinds of brands, and it does not limit marketing tactics, if 山水悦瓶is used, marketing would be more limited to nature imagery. 水赛乐would be my third choice, it makes sense but its not as creative. 山漠水人absolutely did not make sense to me whatsoever, the nature imagery is so forced, and i am not sure how any ""water person"" could have both mountain and desert relations.   I think in the previous activity I really disliked the name, and the conflicting nature imageries confused me, however as this brand, I would say although I still do not love the name, I can say that it does make more sense. To me it represents a water companion through variety of journey and settings.   I like how the name goes along well with the image, every single element in the name matches with the image, ""mountain"" ""nature scenery"" ""happiness"" ""bottle"". It is a perfect fit. activity one I would have rated this name as 68%, activity 2: 75%, with the incorporation of the image: 85%. My criticisms are: the slogan could definitely be better and should be Chinese, every single element in the advertisement campaign is an opportunity to grab the attention of consumer, and if a slogan is in english, it will inevitably lose the opportunity with some Chinese consumers. What are some other ways that the campaign can be shot in order to better resonate with Chinese consumers? Perhaps using a more signature Chinese scenery? (九寨沟，黄果树瀑布，长江，黄山，泰山 etc)   The little water man does not get as many bonus points as 水赛乐when included in this advertisement, mainly because the name itself lacks sophistication and does not match the overall theme of the image. This name previously would have scored a 65%, with the addition of the image, slogan etc. the score remains unchanged.   refer to previous question   Although I understand hydro flask is looking for a name that allows them to be more than a water bottle company, yet I still chose the name with the ""bottle"" idea included because, my first impression of hydro flask is a water bottle brand, and all of its brand reputations were earned by the reliability of their water bottles. I was actually not aware that hydro flask sold anything other than water bottles, I think the positive opinions of hydro flask water bottles will help establish a sense of reliability for their brand that will assist in future brand expansion.   I don't think I liked any names in particular, none of the brands carried a strong ring for me, and it is only after I realized the brand at question is hydro flask that I realized how much 山水悦瓶 fit with the brand.   Brand name wise, I have no complaints, I think the name is fitting with the brand image and everything it is trying to sell. I would advise Hydro Flask to do more research when attempting to enter the Chinese market, what worked in North American market will not directly translate to the Chinese market. Put in more effort.

People would say that I am independent, creative, and generally someone who is always happy to lend a helping hand. My friends would say that I am stubborn, think outside the box even when unnecessary, and someone who goes along with the flow.

My interpretation now has shifted to be more straightforward and to focus more on the 'person' character as the logo suggests.   While the name is suited for the product and wouldn't suggest otherwise, especially with the addition of the imagery, the slogan now seems a bit odd given that the name is more refined linguistically than the more straightforward slogan. Additionally, to appeal to a Chinese market, it's unclear whether a fully english slogan is appropriate. Although straightforward and assumably relatively easy to understand for most people, this opinion is also from me, someone fluent in English and from your side, possibly a group of people who have english as their first language or have been exposed to it for a long time. It may seem that students in China receive mandatory English schooling, but just because they know what it says doesn't mean that they understand the message. It may seem that other brands like Nike also have kept their slogans English in China, but there has been confusion and debate as to what the actual translation to Chinese would be since there could be many different nuanced translations. For a brand not already well known in China, I am not sure how this slogan would fare in a demographic with a completely different culture and language. Some may not care, some might see the English and take it as a status symbol of a brand without knowing what it says at all, or some others may scoff at their literal understanding of the slogan and think it frivolous and meaningless.   From these advertisement images, I can now see that the brand is promoting their water bottles. The name, coupled with the logo, color, and other visual elements, seems to present a cute and whimsical brand image.   The name seemed to heavily focus on the theme of nature, and people who take delight in it. The image seemed to present us with two examples of such people.   This brand is first and foremost a water bottle brand, which is also reflected in the English brand name, which helps Hydro Flask keep true to their essence across the language barrier. I assume the first product to be introduced to the Chinese market are also the water bottles, so this name is the most straightforward in introducing the product.   Due to a subconscious bias, I had thought that the brand direction was something more towards the apparel sector, which had suited the name I initially chose. Now that I understand that it is a water bottle brand, this name is less prone to misinterpretation.   More so than the name itself, I would suggest recreating a general brand image that is more on the elegant side of the spectrum. The Chinese demographic has a different sense of aesthetics than North America or Europe, and so the singularly nature, outdoorsy image now may not necessarily appeal to the masses. Although not as quite poetic as other options, the name itself suggests a more sophisticated undertone so in my opinion, a more graphically conscious approach would seem reasonable, like the ad campaigns for Zwilling, a kitchenware brand that seem to have a lasting reputation within the Chinese demographic.

Yes, the name of brand was not a commercial but a official and positive icon for me.   The light-weight thermos bottle for saving water is totally a great gear for accompanying to go hiking and climbing.   As a brand of water bottle products, this name is obvious to know about and easy to be associated with its usage scenario.   Yes, before getting to know about the brand, I thought 水赛乐 is more dynamic and bring more influence to me when imagining outdoor usage scenario so my favourite used to be it. And now that this is a brand of water bottle, I think 山水悦瓶 would be clearer that it makes water containers.   Trademark application is a must

My best friend would say that I am a kind, optimistic, and multi-cultural person.  My first reaction was that ""what does a bottle have to do with mountain and water."" Maybe it is a water bottle brand?   nature bottle?   It is a water bottle that people can use it in nature like mountains and wateer.   water bottle brand   water bottles  healthy? mountain  My first reaction is that it sounds very erudite and literary. It makes me think of mountain, desert, water, and people.   So do we translate this name to English or to make a new Chinese name according to this one? I am kind of confused here.  If we are translating this to English, I would say ""human and nature""?   It is a place full of nature like mountains, deserts, and water. It connects people with nature.   A sports brand? Like selling hiking shoes, swimming suits, and other outdoor sports-related goods.   selling hiking shoes, swimming suits, and other outdoor sports-related goods  relaxed  I think my first reaction is that the last one is better hahaha. To me, this just means ""little water people"", which is very strange.   I really cannot think of anything other than ""little water people"".   It might be a water-related entertainment for kids since it is small people?   Again, I think it is a watersports-related or water-related entertainment park for children.   The shop might sell swimming suits for kids and other watersports-related goods that are for children.  happy Water park in China  My first reaction is that it is a weird translation because it does not have any meaning when the words are added together in Chinese and it sounds very translated since Chinese people won't name their brand this way.   I cannot really tell what kind of brand this is from this name. To me, it may be a water-related entertainment brand? I think my translation really depends on the brand and its message, so it is hard for me to translate it right now but if I have to translate at this point, I might name it 欢乐水乐园 if it is a water park.   Well, apparently if it is a water park, this name means a happy water park where people can come with their families and friends to enjoy and bond with each other. It is a place without anxiety, stress, and depression, but only happiness.   I like the 山漠水人 since it sounds more literary and erudite, but as a brand name, it sounds too old and old-fashioned. On the contrary, 水赛乐 sounds more young, joyful, and unknown. I think people do not like very obvious name. Being unknown is a good thing I think. It is more mysterious so that people want to know what the brand is. Also this name sounds much more happy and fashionable I think, compared with the other three.   I think originally I thought it was a water park but now I feel like it's more like either a water sports-related brand like selling water bottles, swimming suits, and surfing boards or an adventure park that has zip lines and other water-related adventure parks. I think my interpretation changed because the color and the logo make me feel like it is not a pure entertainment place like swimming pools but more like a sports or adventure-related place.   I think my previous thought was right. This is a watersports-related brand. It sells water bottles and perhaps other products for sports and outdoor activities.   I think it changed from my previous thoughts since i wasn't very sure about the meaning behind this name. I think now it makes much more sense but I still feels like it does not really match with the name.   still the same   Even though this name has a ""bottle"" character that may be too explicit, contrary to how the brand wants to be more than a water bottle company, it is very memorable and smooth to read. I do not know why but when I read the other three names, I feel like it is kind of weird and I can tell that it is translated from a foreign brand. I think the name also aligns with the core message of Hydro Flask that they want to bring joy to their consumers.   Yes, I picked 水赛乐 as my favorite one but this one does not relate much with water bottles. I think even though the brand wanted to be more than a water bottle company, it is still preferred that consumers can tell the products from the brands' name. 水赛乐 makes me feel like a water park, which is very different from the brand, so I think the name has to fit with the products and the brand's message at the same time.   I think as I mentioned before, I prefer the name to reveal a little about the product; otherwise, the consumers will feel like the name does not tell anything about the product and they might not buy it because they don't know what this is. Also, the first three characters fully showed that the brand serves beyond just selling water bottles. They are advocating a kind of lifestyle that they want their consumers to have. ",Zest,
412718,Arnaud,Rouchette,arnaudrouchette@hotmail.fr,"A French guy living in China who thinks he has a great sense of humor.  We leave the water world for a more general outdoor activities feeling, with a funny wordplay.   Mother Nature Magic Bottle!   The brand is providing miscellaneous  trekking or mountaineering equipment, with a range comprehensive enough to enable first timers to enjoy safely their adventure.   The North Face or Quechua.   Trekking shoes, waterproof overcoats, sleeping bags, climbing equipment and very diverse tools.  Amazement A mountain top  The ""人"" feels a little strange and superfluous, I would keep only ""山漠水""   Wanderers!   The brands is covering a wide range of products for all kind of outdoor activities, that are mostly taking place in remote areas.   Decathlon or Intersport.   Kayak and rafting equipment, cliff skydiving equipment kind of extreme sports gear, as well as more generic products.  Concentration  From a ""design"" standpoint, the combination of the three characters is quite relevant and pure. Chinese characters being very graphic, the name in itself could be starting point to a logo.   Little Aquaman!   I would explain that the products are meant for people whose hobbies are related to water sports or water activities, enough for them to identify themselves as ""水人"" with a strong feeling of belongingness. The ""小"" could kind of implies a focus on kids but not for sure.   Swimming brands like Speedo or Arena, or more casual with surfing image as Oxbow or Quicksilver.   Swimsuits, surfing boards, scuba diving equipment etc.  Sense of Freedom The Ocean  The meaning is a little direct, this does not really feel like a brand, compare to the former one this is maybe less casual but also less personal.   Water Race Paradise   The brand is more dedicated to a niche population of competitive water sports afictionados, for which bliss is reached through this particular practice.   As expressed before, this option feels more personal but also more idiomatic. Moreover, the three characters are somehow graphically related ""by accident"", giving a strong basis for a recognisable identity.   Again, the brand now seems more casual, what could have been for extreme sports equipment may now relate to more accessory items.   Very direct, the brand is kind of translating the picture. No change of thoughts.   The whole thing makes a lot of sense, basically this is an advertisement for a water bottle product with a strongly personal brand. Good match.   Companion products for diverse and wild adventures.   For me this brand clearly stands out, and I think is the only one that could make Hydro Flask really feels like a company making more than water bottles. The name in itself make sense, it has an actual meaning in Chinese, and directly relates to the logo instead of the product, which I believe would make a it a very strong and personal brand enabling Hydro Flask to sell any kind of products. A few examples come to mind, one that is interesting is the pneumatic brand Continental, that in Chinese is 德国马牌 “Germany Horse Brand” instead of ""大陆"" or ""大洲"" that would be more direct translation, as it only refers to the logo, and as a matter of facts almost every Chinese people know this brand! Another example would be the homegrown brand 南极人 “South Pole Man/People” selling a wide range of warm clothes, this is distictive and apparently resonates well with Chinese people.   I chose this brand in the first activity, and if we needed a sexond choice it would be 水赛乐 that feels like a brand, although less memorable. The other two would feel quite stange.   Associate strongly the logo to the aspirational lifestyle it want to support, without focusing too much on products themselves, this is already the case in the earlier advertisement. ",Zest,

I love all mysterious things - cats, astrology, and languages.  A healthy beverage that uses ingredients extracted from nature.   Naturease   The name is a word combination of ""Nature""（山水） and ""Ease""（悦）. It suggests the product is healthy and relaxing.   农夫山泉 Nongfu Spring （Springwater brand) 
 依云 Evian (Springwater brand)
   Healthy bottled beverages with minimum artificial ingredients, such as tea and springwater.  Relaxed Teahouse  A remote village surrounded by little mountains, rivers, and enveloped in clouds and mist. Quiet villagers.   Mountains & Rivers in Silence   The name is emblematic of a simple life in the quiet and peaceful countryside. 
 Mountains and rivers are crucial images in the traditional Chinese landscape painting. Upon seeing them, one can immediately relate to the beauty of nature and undeveloped countryside. For the character “漠”, I chose ""Silence"" instead of ""Indifference"" because the former's connotation is more neutral, and it better demonstrates the tranquillity of this image.   江南布衣 JNBY (clothing brand)   It either sells countryside-style clothing or tools for traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting.  Peaceful  It's a moisturising product, probably for the face.   Waterdrop   “小水” means a little bit of water, so I translated it into ""Waterdrop"". I left out ""人"" (People) because it feels unnatural to say ""Waterdrop People"", or something like that. In order to retain the emphasis on ""人"", it can probably design a logo where there's a waterdrop in the human figure.   水知道 Spring Talks (A wet tissue brand)   It sells moisturising products, such as wet tissues, facial masks, and lotions.  Delighted Bathroom  People drinking a sports drink to hydrate themselves after sweating a lot from competitive sports.   HydroJoy   ""水"" is translated into ""Hydro"" rather than ""Water"" here with the implication that this product can make people stay hydrated after sweating. ""Joy"" is the translation of ""乐"", meaning this product can bring a lot of joy to people.   The name is very artistic and intuitive. It has a great combination of images and can inspire so much imagination. It is also potentially suitable for more than one category of products.   I originally focused very much on the characters 山 and 漠 when I first saw the brand name, which reminded me of the countryside and nature. As a result, I thought it to be a clothing brand. But seeing this logo, it doesn't feel like one anymore. It's rather like a water-related product, which greatly diverges from what I originally thought.   It generally makes sense. But it feels a little unusual to use the character 瓶 (bottle) directly in the brand name of a water bottle. I wouldn't have thought this was a water bottle brand. I would have replaced this charter with something else. But 山水悦 feels great.   Everything looks like a good fit. The brand name 小水人 feels cheerful and user-friendly, and also easy to pronounce.   Like I said, use of the character 漠 is confusing. Nevertheless, I can feel the nature because of the characters 山, 水, and also the imagery. I chose ""long-distance"" also because of the character 漠. If it actually means the desert, then it feels like a long trip.   小水人 feels down to earth, but perhaps not that ""premium"". 
 山漠水人 feels a bit too distant and impractical, which is probably not good for a brand selling reusable products. 
 水赛乐 is suitable specifically for the water bottle. But other than that, the product range feels limited. 
 山水悦瓶 makes people think of nature and joy, so I think it's perfect for this brand.   Yes. I changed my mind on knowing it's actually a water bottle brand. This means the product it sells need to be highly practical, which is very different from what the name 山漠水人 made me feel. I imagined it in a much more artistic way. Also, I think 山水悦瓶 can perfect resonate with the company philosophy that everyone should live an active and joyful life in a healthy and eco-friendly way.   I would suggest replacing the last character 瓶 (bottle) as it would limit the product range. In fact, even for water bottles themselves, it still feels slightly unnatural to directly use this character - I've never seen it in any other brand that sells water bottles. ",Zest,

It is something that tells you that playing with water is extremely fun. That’s why it’s called Water beats fun.   Because by simply looking at the characters of Chinese, I know what it is all about.    it’s pretty confusing to be honest for 山漠，I would never have associated it with blue. And the human figure should be blue instead.   this is definitely clearer in meanings as the name is obviously about bottle. And that it gives me the idea of what they are truly selling.    It says the people who are drinking a lot of water during their trips will be happy. It changes a lot as the focus shifts from the bottle to the people themselves.   Cactus is because of the name of the product. Can’t help but associate it with cactus. The rest are mainly because of the image.   If it’s only for one product, that is the flask, I will no doubt choose 山水悦瓶. However, it is for one company and I think the whole idea of the company is align with the name chosen. By using this name, they can not only sell their flask, but also related products. Yet, what they sell is water related and they encourage fun and active lifestyle. With this name, customers have a better understanding as in what they sell.   Yes. I chose 山水悦瓶 because it is more about the flask. I changed it to the latter because the company doesn’t just want to sell flask.   I think it’s better to give Chinese customers a clearer idea as in what they are selling. The name is important but it is doesn’t match with the image, customers will have difficulty understanding what they are trying to promote. ",Zest,
412717,Bai Hong,Yuan,195799135@qq.com,"A guy who does his best to his family, but also considers friends as a family  There is a water brand in China that has a brand called 农夫山泉. When I first saw 山水悦瓶, I thought of the brand, and this name also felt like selling water from the mountains.  And if it was the name of the brand, it would be confusing whether it was selling a water or a bottle.   Fresh water in a bottle and person who is drinking would be happy with it.   A fresh water from mountain and make you happy   Water or water bottle   Fresh water or water bottle  Happy Mountain  When I first see this word, I think of a conflict between words. The second word means desert, so ‘how is there water in the desert?’ It occurred to me that.   Maybe I'll translate it like this. Water is produced in the desert, which is as precious and hard to get, so it will be better water. It’s hard to translate the person in this words. The characters are not really connected each other.   Precious water from a very poor and difficult environment.   I think this words really confuse with the meaning so I cannot really associate any brands.   I'm sure it's a product related to water, but I'm not sure because of the last word, ""person(人)."" I don't know how to interpret that part.
  Sadness  The word gives the impression of water or drinks or energy drinks for children. It feels fresh and bouncy.   Small water man. It gives an image of little cute water character.   This word already reminds me of a cute character related to water. (Maybe it's because of Minions in Chinese) So I would say it's a brand that sells drinks for children.   小黄人 means Minions. It is a similar word order to when Minions was changed to Chinese. So it feels more lively and cute.   Drinks for babies / Energy drink for young people  Lively Playground  A place where water is sold / A place with activities related to water   A happy place for activities related to water.   Where there's activity associated with water that brings happiness.   This word reminds me of a strong image. If there is a character related to the brand, it would be very easy for people to remember. And I felt that there would be a strong connection with the brand.   Because of the second letter ‘漠’, although there is image of logo I still feel the whole meaning doesn’t really make sense.   A bottle of water from a mountain. I think it gives same feeling with image and slogan or without them.
   Previously I thought it matched with words and the logo but after I saw the image  above I feel it doesn’t really match anymore. It means more cute thing for me but the image is too serious.   The background and people's clothes seem to be spending a relaxing time exploring nature.   Most of Hydro Flask's products are available outdoors. Therefore, I think a brand name with ‘赛competition‘ and ‘乐happiness‘ that can give a lively meaning is suitable.   Yes. I have chosen 小水人 before. However, the word is too infantile and feels like selling baby products.   Considering the name of the brand related to water, I think it will be memorable because it is unusual and special.  In fact, 小水人 is the easiest name to remember, but 水赛乐 seems to be special. ",Zest,
230593,Jacqueline,Travaglia,jacqueline_travaglia@hotmail.com,"I resonate with ''sexy is only as good as sexy feels"". I work with amazingly beautiful people in the acting and modelling world; yet I wouldn't describe them all as sexy. I attend swingers clubs AbFab and Killing Kittens and while many of the people wouldn't be classified as classically beautiful, I would say quite a few are sexier due solely to confidence. 
 
 I also agree with the concept of nutri cosmetics. I have turned to vegan products in terms of consumables, skincare and household cleaners and find I have more energy, my skin is better hydrated and I look fresher and younger. Sexy is an attitude as conveyed through appearance by a person’s walk, posture and mannerisms. The slower and more purposeful they walk, the more relaxed their posture, the calmer their mannerisms, the more confident and sexier they appear. This is especially true at the Sex Clubs I have visited; AbFab and Killy Kittens. Calm, grounded energy is sexy while insecure, frantic or nervous energy is very unattractive and sometimes even raises alarm bells. In general, I accept propositions from men who are very confident and undemanding. 
 One of the hottest pickup lines I have heard was from a well-groomed 40 something man at Shoreditch House. I was speaking with a very handsome 25 year old make model when the older man approached me and simply said ‘When you are finished playing with the boys, come play with the men!”’. Physically the 25 year old was more attractive, but in terms of confidence, the older man was much sexier.
  
 I have 2 plus sized female friends who fail to be swiped right on tinder. They are jealous of my model friends who seem to be battling away suitors. However, when it comes to meeting men in the flesh, they seem to attract much more attention than my female model friends. My two plus sized friends are 100% comfortable in their own skin. They eat what they want, drink as much as they like and say whatever comes to their minds. They pursue men- which men seem to find attractive- and they are not afraid to get what they want. I have female model friends who are so worried about getting a bloated stomach on a night out that they cannot relax and I have witnessed men disappear as quickly as they have approached them!! I am 41 years old and the definition of sexy has really changed since I was a little girl. 20 years ago, girls in the UK, Australia and US needed to make an effort on their appearance. They had to stay in shape, wear make-up, wear sexy clothes and even take deportment classes to learn social etiquette. This was considered sexy. I remember my first serious boyfriend telling me I was a little rough around the edges and sending me to deportment school, giving me a makeover at the hair salon and buying me a new wardrobe! My friends and I thought nothing of it.
  
 Things have changed so much. My boyfriends now prefer me without makeup and wearing casual lounge wear.
  
 This does vary considerably by culture. I dated a Russian man for 2 years and he insisted on me wearing heels and makeup and wouldn’t let me eat anything that may change my weight. We fought about this until I went to Russia and saw that was the norm.
  
 I tried to get into The Box in Soho on two occasions without a reservation. Both times I had painstakingly taken 3 hours to get ready, only to be rejected. Then on one random night I took a group of friends from overseas on a pub tour. We were all wearing denim and flat shoes without any make-up. After the last Soho oub closed, I got a little Dutch courage and saw The Box. I decided to try my luck and get in- sure enough they let us all in. I think the alcohol and casual dress made us so much sexier than the desperation we exuded our salon blow dried hair and freshly painted nails of previous attempts! NATURAL, CONFIDENT, ANDROGYNOUS 
 Chatting with male and female friends around the world, the general consensus is that people are becoming more attracted to personality traits rather than aesthetics. I think this will continue to evolve. My male friends are more likely now to say '""I met a really sexy girl who is a Professor"""" rather than the Gordon Gecko Wall Street men of 20 years ago who would describe women on looks alone """"I met a really sexy girl with blonde hair and huge boobs"""". 
 I think this is changing because men and women are more equal so women are defined by their personality or professions rather than solely looks. 
 I also think men in the UK are more metrosexual than other countries I have lived in, such as Australia and US. Women and men are starting to look, dress and act in a more similar way and sexy is becoming more about attitude and character traits than just aesthetics. 
 Make-up and hair styles are becoming more natural and less polished. The androgynous look is more popular than the feminine looks of 1950s glamour. 
 I think in 10 years time sexy will be all about natural confidence with less focus on aesthetics and more on strong character traits of androgynous looking people. In the future, I think the
definition of sexy may merge into one that encompasses all sexes. I think
people will start to look more androgynous and be more sexually confident which will have an impact on
society. 
 Three things
that will thrive: 
 Risqué Advertising 
 As sexiness
becomes more defined by inner qualities and confidence rather than aesthetics,
I think people will become more confident sexually, views
around sex will become less taboo and sex clubs will become more mainstream. As
a result, branding and advertising campaigns will follow the trend and become
more risqué. 
 Plus Size Clothing 
 As people
define sexiness not by clothing size but by personality traits, there will be a
greater acceptance that curvy is sexy and increased demand for sexy plus sized
clothing such that embraces curves such lingerie and nightwear, rather than clothing that hides curves. 
 Growth in Dating Apps for Open
and Polygamous Relationships 
 As sexiness is
redefined and all sexes are more empowered, I think there will be a growth in
dating apps with a focus on those that facilitate open relationships,
experimental sex and polygamy, 
 Three things
that will suffer: 
 Women's and Men's Magazines 
 As the
differences between the sexes dissolves, I think the demand for magazines
segmented by sex will disappear. Gone will be the female oriented glossy's
showing women the latest hair and make-up trends and how to please your man. 
 Gender Oriented Toys 
 As we become
more confident sexually and the gender divide narrows, I think demand for
gender oriented toys such as Barbie Dolls will decline as they are a symbol of outdated roles and value. 
 Counselling 
 As traditional
gender roles disappear and there is increased openness to same sex
relationships, open relationships and polygamy, more couples will find it
difficult to define their role in relationships as traditional roles will
shift. I think counselling and personal development services will see increased
demand as unfamiliar territory is navigated and some people feel displaced. Seven Deadly Sins Launch

230599,Joshua,Mooney,Joshua-mooney@hotmail.co.uk,"I believe given my age and location I'm lucky enough to interact with so many different types of people. All ages, sexualities, genders and nationalities. Which I believe gives me a broader perspective on the role that sex, sexuality and ""sexy"" plays in todays society and beyond. My own subjective idea of ""sexy"" comes from a very specific set of cultural cues as it does with everybody. My idea of sexy as a straight man in a first world country can obviously differ from the idea of sexy of somebody culturally and geographically opposite. 

Sexy to me involves power which I believe stems from living through an age of female empowerment and the re-balancing of gender roles through the 20th and 21st century and being part of a generation able to express themselves freely with less judgment than before. Power is central to my idea of a sexy person , whether that be the power over ones self or over other people. There is no universal absolute or objective ""sexy"" but sexy reveals itself through the way a person acts. I believe sexy is more psychological than physical but can be shown through the way a person is dressed or the way they look.

Confidence is another key element to sexiness also, when a person feels confident they gain a power over themselves - the power to self actualise and to openly express who they truly are and what they truly want without fear of judgment. For me, a woman who is confident and powerful is the epitome of sexy, a person who isnt afraid to pursue who or what they want and be open about getting it. If a person can hold themselves unashamedly and be happy and confident in who they are, that is sexy regardless of what they look like, what they're wearing or who they are. As I mentioned before, sex and sexuality seems to have evolved since the mid-late 20th century as gender roles have been re-shuffled and re thought. 

When you see classically ""sexy"" imagery or adverts from earlier on in the 20th century there seems to be a running trope of this submissive female eye candy there simply to sell a product or arouse interest in a usually male led consumer base. (see photo A). As time has gone on, and especially it seems since the turn of the century, this style of tacky sexist advertisements arent accepted and usually get called out, take for instance the ""beach body"" advert which caused uproar last year (see photo :sunglasses:.

I think this is indicative of a shift in what we see regarding womens ""sexyness"". Of course the model in the beach body advert is hot, and obviously she signed up to do that shoot and knew what it was for, but its the implication in objectifying half of the population of earth in order to shame people into buying a product. Again it comes down to who holds the power.

A good modern example of sexy in adverts (which is a good indicator of modern societies view on sexy) is Dove's ""real beauty"" campaign which showcased confident women of all sizes and shapes and colours half naked. For me it seems that ""Sexy"" has become more ""real"" and less about a fake reality which we're supposed to want to buy into. I feel that the way things are going and sexy is less and less defined by what the ""what turns men on"" trope, there will be a lot more body acceptance and people will begin to be happy and satisfied in who they are and not this aspirational idea of ""does this make me sexy?"". Only the individual can define themselves as sexy through their unashamed confidence in themselves. What would thrive - 

- Brands based around female empowerment using real life models in their campaigns  - Government funded sex ed on TV, unbiased and informative (similar to the Dutch show ""drugslab"" where the traditionally taboo subject of recreational drug use is talked about openly but about sex and sexuality) - Festivals / events where theres a huge female presence on the line up With all three of these examples what im trying to say is that giving women more visibility and equalling the playing field a little, theres more chance of producing confident and powerful women. In short -  Equality is sexy. I'm a straight guy and this isnt me bashing masculinity or guy stuff..  
 What would struggle - 

- Those weird creepy dating seminars for guys who think theres a magic algorithm they can employ to make women want to sleep with them.

- Branches of government which deal with health and sex solely made up of men who are basically telling what is and isnt okay for women to do with their own bodies. - Those terrible Lad Mags (I think they went extinct after the 90s anyway)

Again this reads as if I'm trashing men but I'm not, I just believe confidence and empowerment are sexy, and society should reflect that. Theme -

230597,Fergs,Heinzelmann,fergolina@gmail.com,"I'm a Psychology PhD Researcher, currently doing a research about body image, which was also the subject of my Master's Thesis. So the whole concept of beauty and consequently of sexy has a main point in my work. 
 I'm specially moved by this topic as I was born and raised in Brazil, a place historically connected to sensual and sexy (initially because of the indians, but also because of the whole Carnival celebration). So here the sexy notion plays a major role on how society arranges itself. It somehow determines gender roles and also life achievement expectations. And I do believe that our idea of sexy as a society differs from the other South American and even Latin America countries. There is something about Brazil in this topic that I never found in any other place I've been. For me, sexy is a quality that comes naturally and catches someone's attention in a way that it can seduce the senses, any of them. So, for me, anything can be sexy, not just people, as seduction could relate to all the five ways of experiencing things: sight, odor, taste, hearing, or touch. For instance, some good smelling food can seduce by its odor and also by its taste. A pleasant song can be seductive to listen to. Even images, paintings can be seductive by its sight. So basically I think sexy is the feeling of being so pleased by something that someone could be turned on by it. 
 Considering that, it's important to mention that this feeling would be very personal, and probably would mean different things if someone asked different people about it. Despite that, I believe that people historically tended to have biased ideas towards sexy, like that it could be described by an unique expression and that as if it would mean the same for everyone. But fortunately I also think that our view as a society has been changing its thoughts on this subject. It seems that people have started to realize that as that famous sentence says ""beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"", and following this line of thought, sexy would also be in the feelings of whoever is caught by it. 
 Nowadays it seems important to take this into consideration, in order to have more diversity in society, accepting differences in appearance, ways of being, thinking and acting. I think it leads to a more humane society where respect for other feelings has a major role. I personally think that my views on what sexy means were built by things I have experienced, by the ""zeitgeist""of the time I'm living in, by the place I live, but also by age. I mean, as I get older and consequently more mature, my views changed gradually in order to apply to the life I have, concerning where I live, what I do, the people I relate to. So, when I was younger I think what used to caught my attention was more cliché. As I grew up, experienced different ways of being, of living, met different people, I could build my own views and also a more critical perception on what's interesting. 
 Being born and raised in Brazil means being exposed to a certain concept of sexy since you can remember. I takes time and a lot of effort to change that, in order to find meanings that actually applies to you personally. Specially for people that don't exactly fit in the previously determined country sexy concept. I want to believe that the discussion is going in a broader direction, evolving in the way that the ideas of beauty, and consequently of sexy, are not pre conceived and based on strict standards. What makes me feel this way is the fact that people are actually discussing this now. It may be that somehow the whole diversity proposal was captured by media in order to sell stuff. But I feel that even the perception of this as a market comes from a real place, from people that really experience different ways of being. Thinking about these concepts in the past, they felt almost instinctive, something natural that had I certain way to be. Definitely something has changed there. So hopefully in 10 years it won't even be necessary to discuss it, as society will be understanding and respecting as a whole. Concerning my thoughts on sexy being so broad and focused on understanding and respecting different views and feelings about it, bellow is the list of what I think will thrive or struggle in this new brave 10 years ahead world. 
 4// What I feel would thrive 
 - Sustainability: This is a must. More like a need than some random thought, sustainable living has to become a global goal if people still want to live in this planet. So I guess this idea has to thrive as it is basically our only option. And in this sense I think people will choose more healthy and animal cruelty free lifestyles. Even if some world leaders deny it, global warming is real and the way we live, specially how we feed has a giant impact on it.
 
 - Technology as a tool for (sharing) economy: The global economy crisis has made really hard for people around the world to afford their basic needs as food, living, clothing... I really don't see a scenario where this may change any time soon, specially considering the world's latest political directions and decisions. So in order to survive, I guess people will focus on trading services and stuff, as it has already been happening in clothing industry. Technology plays a major role in that as it is the tool used to connect people. 
 - Diversity in society: I guess there's no coming back from it. Even if we see so much hate directed to determined cultures, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and body shapes, I believe this will pass. It's not possible to ignore what became so visible. So through an easy or hard way, I think in 10 years we will live in a more diverse society. 
 5// What I think would struggle 
 - Paper: What will we need paper for when everything can be done digitally and saved in a cloud? Besides the technological revolution, using paper means cutting trees, and my guess is that this will become more and more an issue to be avoided. 
 - Narrow minded people: I know right now it seems the other way around, but my guess is that 10 years is enough time for people to come to the conclusion that hate and segregation have never ended well, and this time won't be different. As diversity moves forward, narrow minded people will have to change their values and views about the world. I think respect will be a main topic in this future society that won't be willing to prejudice and hate. 
 - Consumerism: There's no way for industry to still produce things the way it does now. It leads to horrible situations as pollution, workers so badly payed that could be called slaves, and a way of living that is not sustainable at all. As I believe we will focus on taking better care of our environment, society will have to adjust its perception on success and it's not possible for it to be based on things people have. In order to be lined up with my previous answers, and considering what I think will thrive 10 years from now, I would choose live web transmission in the most significant social media platform at that given time. Nowadays I would choose Youtube or Live Stories on Instagram, but it's hard to tell which one of this platforms will still be meaningful in the next decade - maybe a social media platform that doesn't even exist yet. 
 
 The theme and also the hashtag would be #JoyIsTheNewSexy 
 The idea is to show that anything and anyone can be sexy, as it is related to what brings joy. This concept is very plural, but also very personal. So the public would have the chance to translate it in what that means for them. 
 The guest list would be anyone with internet access, as the launching for the brand would be open for everyone. 
 Real people from different places, ages, genders, gender identities, ethnicities, professions, religions, and body shapes, with different thoughts on what's is sexy and how they relate to it in their lives, would be the spokepersons. Of course there would have to be some previous selection in order to choose maybe 10 people. To assure that real people would be casted, the casting could happen in the streets of 10 different cities. 
 The idea is to really show diversity, real lives, real people being themselves - not the kind of pretend diversity with actors and models that usually are seen on the adds. This spokepersons will be invited to share with the public their thoughts on Sexy and Joy and how the brand has a role in bringing this ideas to this brave new world. They could choose a product from the brand that somehow relates to their testimonials. 
 The food and drinks wouldn't be an issue, as the public would watch the launch at their own home, so they choose what to eat and drink. Whatever gives them joy. 
 For the media, an invitation would be sent by e-mail (and maybe through the chosen social media platform also) previously, telling about the launch. It would call them to know why #JoyIsTheNewSexy. At the moment I'm working on my Social Psychology PhD thesis, based on gender studies and how gender questions can relate to and impact our health and well being. Researching this topics has made me realize how much the social minorities struggle in our world (maybe it gave me a wider view, as being brazilian is almost impossible not to notice that) and how when we propose something, like a survey, or even if it is the launch of a new product/brand, we should consider a broader view in diversity. This should also be considered in our daily lives, I feel that the world could use a bit more empathy between people. 
 To create this proposal I thought a lot about a book I've been reading: "" Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world "". The main teaching of this book is to dedicate more time to enjoy thinks in life. Even daily stuff that people do automatically. We are living in troubled times, so I think that paying a bit more attention to what makes us happy could help us see a more optimistic future. And I feel that whatever sexy may mean nowadays is totally related to that. 
 About the technology playing a major role in our lives I've mentioned in my answers I was inspired by the Netflix series "" Black Mirror "". I mean about how our can society relate to new technologies, and how human relations are affected by them. The HBO series "" Westworld "" also discusses this subject. And I think the Hulu produced "" Handmaid's Tale "" was a reference on how things can go totally wrong if we don't consider the 6 things that would thrive and struggle in my view for a ""brave new world"".        ",Zag,
230603,Susan,Schell,susankristinaschell@gmail.com,"       I think there is a major trend of promoting the deep understanding of health and wellbeing as it is connected to the beauty industry. I find this new tendency towards transparency as well as the emphasis on thorough consumer education processes incredibly interesting. This massive shift in the beauty industry is fascinating to me because it is such a departure from deep rooted typical beauty dogmas like “conceal” and just “cover up.” It is all about changing to be more focused on healing from within to help the outside match the inside and health is finally being prioritized over masking unsightly issues.
  
 I personally take vitamins like Biotin for my hair, skin, and nails so I think vitamins and what you eat do make a difference in your appearance. I strongly believe that what you eat effects how you feel and how you feel directly impacts how you look. I know that I care about the ingredients that are in products, vitamins, and food. I always want to know why they work or why they don’t. I also often feel overwhelmed by the myriad of options out there on the market and the contrasting reviews people give them – I never know what “authority” to trust. The same goes for food trends and diets… I try to take everything with a grain of salt but am never sure what is really healthy or what is pseudo-healthy nonsense. 
  
 So I think I’d be good for this project because I am invested in this subject matter but am also able to take a step back and look at it through a critical lens. I think being healthy can mean a lot of different things to a different people. This might be a somewhat generic answer but I do believe that “healthy” (aside from medical conditions) is a feeling. I think being healthy means feeling good and like you are in control of your life. To me it means that you set reasonable health goals for yourself and you try to accomplish them each day. It means being focused on prioritizing yourself and valuing yourself enough to take the time to care for yourself like you deserve. And I don’t mean this in a self-important way, I mean it like having respect for yourself and putting yourself first so that you are at your best and able to contribute more to this world we live in. 
 So for me I think being healthy is having focus and structure in your life. It is about making time to exercise, to eat right, to drink enough water, to make sure you are in a good place mentally, and it can encompass a lot but I think it is all about prioritizing. But of course, you can’t be perfect every day – I think it is also about being reasonable and not too rigid or controlling with yourself. It is also about balance, I think being too intense or obsessive about health is equally as dangerous as not thinking about it at all. I believe in being well rounded in every facet of life and this applies to health and diet as well – balance is always key. You need a little bit of everything but not too much of any one thing. It is also about forgiveness and understanding with yourself. We all make mistakes and have bad days or make bad choices but I think having a healthy attitude means being able to accept it, learn from it, and move on. It is also about evolving and growing. I value self-awareness and personal growth, for me I think this is connected to health and wellness because it also focused on self-improvement and being the best version of yourself.
  
 I try to eat well – (emphasis on “try”) I don’t always succeed but I am proud that I try! I also love trying different ways of exercising like Yoga, Pilates, dancing, volleyball, biking, running, etc. I really am all about balance in my life, I try to think in terms of evening myself out. For example, if I’m feeling stressed out at work all day maybe I should go to a yoga class instead of a dance class or going out for a drink – maybe I need to set some time aside for myself and regroup. Or maybe I don’t want to go to yoga at all and I really do just need to go grab a drink and chat with some friends. I try to listen to myself as much as possible without being totally hedonistic about it. 
 I feel like I tend to notice “health” in other people more in their personalities and outlooks on life than I do in their routines or diets. Health can be superficial and visible but I really do feel like attitude is a major part of health. Unhealthy is the worst feeling, your body literally rejects unhealthy behaviors quite violently – too much drinking or eating often lead to unfortunate physical experiences. I think when you are unhealthy and not taking good care of yourself you can see it because to me, unhealthiness is really synonymous with neglect. Health is maintenance and unhealthiness is neglect and disinterest. Again, I believe this is very connected to feelings, if you don’t feel well, it is written all over your face. At least for me it is, people can tell when I haven’t slept enough or if I’m sick my face looks completely different. It is also how you carry yourself – it is very difficult to feel confident if you don’t feel well. It is a total downward spiral, if you don’t feel well it is hard to motivate yourself to make positive food choices or exercises because you are just seeking “easy” and “comfortable.”
  
 I think it is also very unhealthy when people focus too much one aspect of health but forget the big picture. One of my friends was a vegan for health reasons but would often eat things like Oreos because they were vegan. And to me this was very confusing, because the fact that an Oreo’s cream is so fake and made of so many random chemicals that it is not even remotely dairy in any way is really bad sign, not a positive! But my friend was justifying them as an OK snack because they were vegan. So that makes no sense to me and I think it is crazy unhealthy to do things like that and tell yourself it is ok because of arbitrary reasons you have invented. (Note: Oreos are not vegan in the UK because they do actually use milk to make them there...but not here in the US, ours are full of chemicals.) 
 It is also very unhealthy to be overly concerned with being healthy. As I mentioned previously it is easy to go too far and be too obsessed with being healthy. I’m a huge supporter of the “everything in moderation” way of thinking. I think you need to indulge, enjoy life, and not limit yourself but also not to go too crazy. I would describe my health journey as a bit of a rollercoaster. Consistency is a real challenge for me and I struggle with finding balance in my own life. My personality is a little bit “all or nothing” which is not ideal and it is not what I would consider healthy. I go through periods of healthy behaviors and then get thrown off my routine and fall back into lazy or bad habits. I do enjoy working out and being active but if I’m depressed or stressed I tend to lock myself up in my apartment and distract myself with non-productive things like TV. When I get into a good swing of things and am eating well and working out consistently I am proud of myself and want to maintain what I have already been doing. But if I’m starting at a low point, I find it really tricky to motivate myself and pull myself out of that funk. 
 I have never, ever, been on a successful diet. I can’t limit or restrict myself when it comes to food. The second I tell myself I can’t have something, it is all I want. I have found that I do much better with giving myself loose guidelines – so instead of a strict diet I simply try to eat better and make better choices. That feels more like something I can actually accomplish as opposed to testing my will power. I think I tend to make pretty healthy choices during the day but also feel more inclined to indulge at night. A healthy breakfast and lunch are easy for me and I don’t really snack during the day; however, when it comes to dinner I always want something really delicious and usually want to follow it with a dessert. 
  
 I am very much a creature of habit – I like to eat at specific times and often eat the same meal day after day. I also always drink two cups of coffee with milk each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon around 2 or 3pm. The coffee is kind of a non-negotiable for me, I really love it and look forward to it all day. I almost never have more than two cups but I allow myself the two each day without too much judgement. I think I also tend justify a lot of my behaviors by comparing myself to other people – meaning I’ll think things like “well at least I don’t drink 4 coffees a day” or “at least I don’t drink soda.” I am self-aware about this but know it is not the best mentality.
  
 I try not get too focused on health and dieting because for me I can easily get too overly concerned and then feel bad about myself if I don’t live up to my own expectations. I think I have found a pretty healthy attitude towards health and just try to do my best while also giving myself a fair amount of wiggle room. I think it is hard to pinpoint exactly what “health Nirvana” would be – because it is a journey without a defined destination. However, I think that means constantly trying, constantly working on self-improvement. I feel like effort is always rewarding, so you always get out what you put into something. For me I feel like pride is what I would associate with reaching this Nirvana or balance in your life. I feel the best when I’m proud of what I have done and the choices that I have made. And you can be proud about really small things on your health journey and I think this pride helps propel you to continue to maintain whatever good habits you are proud of. I’ve said this a lot but I do associate balance with this as well – a mix of focus on health and occasional indulgence is important to me. But I think feeling in control of these indulgences is really significant and demonstrates a truly healthy attitude. I would want to share a lot of health education – I feel like so much of the information that is out there in the world is confusing, misleading, unreliable, or antiquated. So many people are confused about misleading labels like “sugar free” or “fat free” and I think it is so important that people really understand that most of these taglines are just advertising gimmicks and don’t actually mean that the food is healthy. I would want to create some reliable source that had real information with modern studies that applied to modern food and modern people. I also wish doctors were more accessible and that it was more common to discuss your daily habits with them and ask them all the questions you might have. It would be nice to have some authority that was accessible and didn’t make you feel bad or stupid for asking. I think this kind of applies across the spectrum of health from diet and exercise, to mental health, to sexual health, and general personal wellbeing. There should be more access to legitimate information. 
  
 I often feel like companies are intentionally misleading with the information they provide about their products and use trigger words or fear mongering to sell products and this should not be allowed. I am tired of being lied to or manipulated. I actually feel less inclined to try new products because I don’t want to waste my money or get my hopes up on nonsense, useless products. I think if companies were more transparent, and there is a shift towards this now, I would be more inclined to try their products because they are being real and not sneaky. So I would push towards brutal honesty when it comes to products because I think people are really over all the smoke and mirrors. Companies should want their ingredients to be good and straightforward, educating your customer shouldn’t be a bad thing.  
  
 My personal experiences make me really untrusting of products and advertising. So, I would hope that either the industries would change or that people would become more critical of information that they are receiving. Not to sound jaded but I think we need to not just take things at face value, having a deeper understanding of what you consume or buy is really important. I think the media and advertising industries should be held accountable for their role in misleading the public and that they should try to also be more transparent and “real.” I know that is pretty much impossible but it is just really sick how much false information we are fed on a daily basis. 
 In terms of partners – I think things should be rooted in hard data so working with trustworthy doctors and scientists to really understand the data and then find a way to make it digestible yet informative to customers. But again, I think whatever spokesperson is used, the data and information needs to be honest and accessible. 
  
 I think a lot of brands are focusing more and more on educating their customers and empowering them. I think brands like Glossier have done a great job of this and develop a cult-like following because it is so different and so accessible in both price point and information. I would want to work people like this who are thinking outside the typical ridged industry standards and capitalizing on this. So, I have personally done a lot of interviews about hand health and nail care because I work as a hand model (in addition to being a jewelry designer.) I get people asking me about what products I use all the time so I try to be honest and straightforward about my routines. I like to explain to people that my hands aren't perfect - that even as a hand model I get photoshopped or I break nails and have issues too. It has been really eye-opening for me to see just how fake most images are - like my hands will be photoshopped onto someone else or every line in my knuckles gets airbrushed away...the beauty standards we have set are absolutely impossible, even down to your hands.   Here are few links to some articles I have done: Hand Model Nail Care Tips - The Coveteur

 This is less about hand care and more just talking about our weird experiences as hand models (I'm Susan by the way:grin:)",Zag,ESFP

 Why you want to take part in this project: 
 
 As a kid, I grew up in a pharmacy run by my parents who are pharmacists where they sell everything from medicines, skincare to nutri-cosmetics. After the pharmacy closed, My dad established his successful skincare company in Thailand, and now he is focusing on vitamins and nutri-cosmetics. Whilst my mom is very much into wellbeing and youth through eating, she is 54 and looks amazing because the good food she took. So I am surrounded by them and their ideas of nutrition and being honest to customers since I was a child. As a millennial, I find this fascinating when these things in my childhood became a big trend in food and wellbeing, and I want to bring my creative potential and unique perspective from my arts and design training to understand and imagine the exciting future of nutri-cosmetics. 
 
Anything else that you think might help us make our selection: 
 Physically and mentally conscious, in my works I always like to explore the relationships between our physical body and the mind. I am a firm believer of 'you are what you eat' , and by eating I mean what you take in mentally as well. While there are so many nutri-cosmetics now in the market, I want to bring my perspective on the emotional qualities of the food and the impact of our eating behaviour on physical wellbeing beyond facts and figures. I think by having a healthy food, with a healthy ritual and a healthy mind, would make you really glow from the inside out. Being healthy for me is a great, holistic feeling. It means Feeling balanced in both my phycisal body and my mental mind. They both have to be helping each other to gain this balance. When I am healthy, I am feeling at peace with myself, optimistic, and empowered, like I can go out and do everything in the world. For me, the first person in the world I could make better is myself and we often forget the wellbeing of ourselves to serve the purpose for others. Thus being healthy is a feeling that I am successful at taking care of myself. Because the healthy routine takes a lot of disciplines, consistency and persistence, it is a personal success that will make me confident in succeed in other things. Often times I find that the mind plays a little bit more role in the outlook. When I have good thoughts, or being delight, my face and my positive attitude glows outwards and it makes me look healthy and attractive. 
 The healthy routine I take is mostly an exercise that links me to my personal nature and benefits the mind, be it yoga, meditation, writing, walking without specific destination, as well as choosing to eat healthy food and fruits. I need to go out and be immersed in nature at least once every week before I feel low, as I love being among nature or greenery to rebalance my stress in everyday life. If I choose to run, I go run in the park rather than in the gym because of the trees and the fresh air. If I don't have time, I try to make the little details in daily routine as nourishing as I can. I also love skincare a lot and the rituals of putting skincare on yourself is therapeutic. To spot healthy in someone else, I always feel it from the person. It is the quality that shines from the inside out. Mostly it's the blood flooding through their vein, their attitude, the glow in their skin to the shiny hair and the nails. However, some people might look very fit but they also look very controlled/stressful at the same time. 
 
 
 
 The video below represents a healthy couple, both in peace with themselves so they have a healthy relationship with each other. The whole video you can see the way they talk, smile, act to each other. And their body and mind seem to be very fit and healthy. The girl is a vlogger on my favorite channel on Youtube at the moment : ProfessionalWildChild For me, being unhealthy has a lot to do with stress and the anxiety of the mind. If I reach the certain level of stress or have problems that I could not solve, the first thing to spot being unhealthy is the face. When I am unhealthy, I have a low mood, unconfident and don't like what I see in the mirror. Because my face looks dull and I do not bother to impress anyone, I don't care much when putting make-up on, neither do I want to meet people or go out and socialise. My conversations would be different, and it has more negative feelings. So I don't want to project them to other people and choose to stay in more. This could lead to other unhealthy behaviours in my routine such as binge eating, binge watching, sleeping in, sleeping late and wasting a lot of money buying stuffs just to make myself feel better. When I am stressed, I eat a lot of sweets and food that in the normal time I would not, such as junk food or a lot of carbs. It helps lifting up the mood and comfort the mind for a certain period of time yet after the peak goes down, I found myself in the same unhealthy cycle again and again. The results are the body that is unfit, the mind that is untrained and the self that is the underperformed version of your best self. I will feel very unconfident in this body. 
 To spot unhealthy is to spot an unhealthy attitude and body in the person. Generally, it is quite rare to see the obete, sick, or stressed people that look happy and shine from the inside out. When they start to speak, their attitudes tell a lot about their mind, what they are thinking and if they are happy with themselves. Most of the people who are not happy and at peace with themselves would project certain negative vibe around them. It is something opposite of glow. If glow feels like a little buddha shining inside out, the unhealthy is the grey cloud surrounding one. For me the quality of being unhealthy relates a lot with the use of drugs, smoke, excessive alchohols, and over make-up. It is also good to point that a lot of young people suffer from depression due to the lifestyle of the millennials nowadays that relies on social media. I notice that if me and my friends spent too much time on social media, we will start to feel low quite easily. It is the peer pressure, because we are constantly surrounded by the ideal images on the ads and the models of the fashion and beauty industry, and also our peer groups that focus a lot on the materialistic outside of the person, than the inside and the unique quality of each. Working in fashion industry, I spot many fashion models that represent the unhealthy because they would look like a perfect lifeless hanger more than a healthy human enjoying fashion. However, I believe that brands should focus on being compassionate and transformative, to bring the best out of each person in order for everyone to be themselves, to communicate the feelings of nourishment and acceptance, and that is the first step to fight the unhealthy messages constantly push by the media nowadays. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a lifelong, dynamic and evolving journey. For me it is about being balance and coming back to the right track when I lost sight the track once in every while. Sometimes I'm too high, sometimes I'm too low, so the challenge is to alternate between these pendulums of the mind. 'Maintaining healthy' means if I succeed at it, I could perform much better in every other aspects of my life. So, I never think about this journey before until I moved from Bangkok to London, started living on my own as well as started studying a Master. In this life stage, my age is 24-26 and it is also a transformative moment of myself trying to be an adult. 
 Back home, I do not have to think much about health, because the food we eat in Thailand is more plant-based, organic and good for the gut because of the spices and herbs. Also surrounding by friends and family rarely make me feel the need to take care of my mental health because I am not feeling as lonely (and If I am stressed, I go to massage which is cheap and could calm me down). In the first place, I got very high and excited about all the new places, possibilities and challenges studying a Master and living alone in the foreign country. I explored everything and trying to make a lot of friends. But the first time that trigger my conscience strongly is when I first experience the winter in London, after breaking up with my long-distant partner.  Emotionally I feel low, because of the grey and cold weather, the lack of the sun and the lack of close relationships around me. I tried to meet friends and eat a lot in London not only because the food scene here is vibrant but it also makes me feel better. In winter, I eat a lot of comfort food and sweets to make myself comfortable, because I do not want eat the healthy clean food such as salads or smoothies in that kind of weather. And I did not go run in the park either because it was too cold. I am from the country that we always have sunshine and 30 degree temperature, so when the sun went down at 3pm in the afternoon, I started to feel very low and spent a lot of time sleeping in, binge eating and just don't want to do anything. 
 So, during the time, I struggled and explored many ways to nurture and feel at peace myself, started with writing and keeping a journal to record and write down feelings when I need to talk to someone. I started taking up meditation and going to yoga at the neighborhood studio and felt much better and in control of my mood, my personal wellbeing. I feel a lot more at peace and calm after those activities, and then started to be more careful about what I eat more. I am that kind of person who do not like fast exercise that much, but I like to walk and strolling the city, so I try to balance my eating habit with the steps I did in a day ( I have a fitness tracker but do not count calories). For me it is obvious that if I am in a relaxed, calm state, I automatically feel less in need of appetite. I eat better stuffs because it does not effect my mood that much, because I am stable. So, the emotional journey intertwines with the spiritual and the physical body. The mix of these activities help me maintain my balance and strive through the upcoming challenges in the study and in life. 
 I believe maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a state of flux just like life, we can go high or low in certain times and to keep coming back to the balance is a challenge every now and then. But once I found a pattern of routines and lifestyles that help me feel balanced, it is already stamped on my brain and I know what to do when I feel unhealthy and low in the future. So the more often I know I lose track, I came back to the state of balance quicker, It is like a muscle that you become better at it everyday through the use of it. The nirvana of my health sounds like bliss. It would feel like a blissful state of mind, one of the goal in life that I want to experience. That comes with a lot of challenges before getting to that state. I think that health nirvana is changing every life stage, whether it be in my 30s, 40s or 50s and beyond, growing and aging gracefully and peacefully is the journey of nirvana in my imagination. 
 I am not sure if the journey could ever end because the health is a state of flux, as mentioned before, but the more we trained our mind and body, the more we come back quicker to our balance and healthy lifestyle. So, The health nirvana for me sounds calm and stable, the state when you do not have that much flux, highs and lows anymore. You are totally aware and at peace with yourself, because you have explored what is right and what is not right for your body and mind thousands of times before. You practiced a lot in maintaining the healthy relationship with your body, and the people around you, that you have no doubt how to make the situation and relationship happy every time the problems may come. 
 This super power sounds like something that comes with experiences, and I guess aging is one of the key to reach the future health nirvana. I love when I see aging women who look super graceful and elegant, and super beautiful. She looks healthy and fit although she is aging, maybe because she has taken the good food and maintain a healthy lifestyle for years of her life. I do not know how many wrinkles have been developed on her face, but her calmness, her glow and the feelings that she has lived her life and totally in harmony with herself shone through. She won't be moved easily from the outside or material factors, she won't run or follow things that she knew would not suit her.  You can feel the feeling of proud, of enough, of compassion shines around her. She has more charm than the young women who look a bit more messy and still has a lot to do with their lives. She is living the best version of herself. She is totally free. 
 The words I would associate with the feeling : glow, grace, calm, relaxed, elegant, stable, nourishing, harmony, freedom, unity, utopia If I have arrived at my very own health nirvana, I would be happy and have a passion and compassion to spread the tips and the feelings to help mankind around me. In the future, I think technology would be more seamless, more humanistic and thus might benefit our routine to maintain a healthy lifestyle more. 
 Because each individual is not the same, the first advice I would share to people is to take time to learn about themselves and the patterns in life they developed, because they are the hardest thing to discard (old habits die hard.) It is not always easy for people to understand their behaviours and patterns, so then, I will offer them the long-term relationship, personalised services, or engage the technology that help them track their own lifestyles in years. After I understand each person, the business/product/service I set up would act as their personal coach in transforming people towards the better version of themselves both physically and mentally. From the nutrients that match with their physical body, and the activities that match their lifestyles, needs and personalities. 
 In a bigger picture, maybe I could categorize people in their body types and their mental types, learn more about their personal problems and goals and match them with the routines and lifestyle activities that would work for them. We might know that this person is a pear-body who wants to exercise and feel good, yet she is a type-A personality, an ambitious workaholic that has to sit down in front of the computer all day. We might learn that she is struggling with some personal problems so she has certain degree of anxiety and depression, and love to eat desserts. Being skeptical and struggle about relationships is the main thing that obstruct her from reaching her goals which could be a successful relationship. So, combining all of the information we learnt about a person is crucial for our service so that we learn what could be best inspire her and uncover her real needs. The idea is that we are her best friend and we care about her, not just her body weight but her overall mental wellbeing, we would be able to tailor the products that match her needs. 
 I am a firm believer in the effect of nature on human because we are interconnected and human are naturally a part of nature. But we are more alienated from it everyday with the screens and technology. By positioning our service in harmony with human and nature, I want to encourage the future generation to experience and utilise the effect of it more then ever before. 
 I think this product or service has to act like an epitome of health for the new generation. Now, NIKE is the top brand that has a consistent communications similar to this feeling, but they were a bit too athletic for people who are not that athletic. My product/service would be more related to 'glow' or the shine from the inside out, and penetrating to the heart of the clients, touching them in their very personal journey with themselves. By tracing and understanding a very core of each personal struggle is essential, and the essence of this product/service would be the feeling of harmony and nourishment for everyone.  However, the future personalities and needs would be very fragmented so here the big data would have a big role in the business and services. 
 Otherwise, the product/service could represent the feeling of health nirvana, the utopia that inspires everyone to feel more balanced and healthy in everyday life in order to be there anytime they want, regardless of age, it is the feeling of 'here and now.' The partners who could help me bring this product/service to life would be the mix of multi-disciplinary teams. From nutritionists, psychologists, sociologists, biomedical specialists, yoga and other fitness experts. They are the people who share the same goals in working towards the healthy and balanced lifestyles and have empathy for the struggles of the people and the sustainability of lives on the planet. We want to disrupt the conventional models of products and services by hacking to the most efficient and seamless innovation to integrate in their lifestyles without requiring too much from them. But let them see the results. 
 Utilising the harmony of human and nature, brands that could support me would be the brands that work towards the sustainble innovation of the planet. If you say glow, the brands that appear in my mind is not NIKE, Adidas, Apple or Google and Facebook. I will rather have a brand that represents innovation in a calmer and sustainable way, which is mostly now in skincare and beauty spheres. I like Haeckels, the algae-based brand, and other ethical, animal-free skincare products. The future supplier I use would be the lab, scientists and farms that produce innovative in-house plant-based technology and resources that do not disrupt the natural cycle of the nature. http://www.trendtablet.com/121... : The algae dome by SPACE10, a highly active and progressive future-living laboratory and exhibition space located in the heart of Copenhagen, investigate innovative solutions to the future challenges of urban living.

230607,Ayur,Sandanov,tushania@gmail.com,"       It was made clear that a what's needed for this challenge is having strong opinions. I'm a filthy know-it-all, an internet trivia junkie, and a pop science writer – frankly, I've got opinions coming out of my ears, and trying hard not to impose them on others. This goes for nutrition, health, self-improvement, and self-destruction. I am quite fond of the latter, but also very interested in keeping my body well and understanding how it works. 
 I am a guy who reads the WHO bulletin about bacon and goes on a 5-hour internet binge to find out what are those nitrites all about, and also how they make pulled pork and what it's called on different continents. (And, as long as I'm there, how to make a stew out of it.) 
 I love the smell of birch tar soap and Ballistol (a gun oil that's also great for the skin, and taking care of wood furniture - not joking; it smells like licorice). I also cook for myself. It runs the gamut from celery salads to greasy homemade burgers and Buryatian steam dumplings. I think first of all, being healthy is feeling energized. That's the main giveaway of when you _aren't_ being healthy — you just care less, desire less, sleep in later, do less, and give up easier. Of course, all of the above is really about will and self-discipline, but for a given amount of those (and I possess very little of both) healthy choices really make a difference. For me, external markers of being healthy are first of all how a person's skin looks. I suspect it's the hardwired detection mechanism we all have in us, but I also made rational observations in that regard - for example, I've a vivid memory of seeing dehydrated, parchment-like skin up close (very up close) on a young woman after a lot of partying, that gradually went away throughout the day as the harmful effects receded. It made an impression on me. I myself have a dark creamy complexion that isn't easily changed even by the most harmful of excesses, but still of course I can tell when I look worse for wear in the mirror - or identify the good that sun and exercise does for me. At the end of the day, all of the metaphors we have for very healthy people are about ""glow"" and ""shine"" - the unmistakable look that you can't fake with false tan or cosmetics. The other big one is poise and movements, the stance and spring.
 Being / looking healthy for me is being neat & hygienic, eating light & varied meals, moving more than I usually do (I lead a very sedentary lifestyle, so this includes things like spring cleaning and walks), and taking in a varied mix of intellectual stimuli, like books, movies, and analytic research instead of simply browsing easily digestible info. I feel that in a modern world, being unhealthy is simply giving in to any number of routines that are offered to you. Overindulging and getting on a single track with comfortable consumption routines. I am at my unhealthiest when I overindulge in lurking the web, smoking, and drinking casually (without any pretext, as a habit). I take a health hit when I give in to the sugar / carb cravings and buy snacks and sweet beverages, I really do realize that in that moment, consciously. I may neglect grooming. Interestingly, the hardest hitting unhealthy thing for me is shifting day schedule. Since I mostly don't need to adhere to any schedules, unhealthy, unstructured, overindulgent living knocks my normal schedule out of whack. I may go to bed at 10AM and rise at 5PM, and then go to bed at 1AM and rise at midnight... And I have to say, this alone feels more unhealthy and dispiriting for me as any other things combined. I feel it demoralizes me completely, leading me to ""scrap"" whole days until the normal schedule is restored. I read and think a lot about exercise, but it's still kind of an abstract thing to me, unfamiliar and seemingly pointless. Rationally I understand why you need it, and understand how you can enjoy it and even get addicted to it, but throughout my adult life, I still haven't made the leap over the initial pain to start enjoying it. Spiritually, I feel very strongly that I am completely formed by what I routinely think and by how I approach matters and people. I did a lot of improvised different mental exercises to clear the mind, get rid of pointless circling negative thoughts, irrational anger and irritation, and ""meditation for sleepless nights"", and I feel that even half-baked as they all were, they all helped me. I also love the paradox of morning hours being longer and more fulfilling than night hours. Lately I've successfully began to rise at 5-6AM, and it feels great - even though I don't have a problem of very busy and cluttered work day as it is, still I feel more aware, prepared, and ""getting ahead"" when I do stuff in the early morning and literally run out of stuff to do by 8-10 PM. Cooking is a part of it, too. Planning a relatively healthy and wholesome meal and carrying out your plan is satisfying and practical (living alone, cooking once often gives me something to eat for a week). As I've said, it's really really clear when you're doing unhealthy things. Life just loses the shine that it often (even without any particular reason) has, desires and feeling of worth get dulled, sense of order and enthusiasm for life bleed out of you. At some point, the need for caring for your body and soul (like the great monks / thinkers / philosophers of old did) becomes so evident and clear, it trumps anything else - all pretense, all the silly stuff you had in your head before. I like the expression from a little-known movie where a regular honest everyman becomes a celebrity without aiming for it. When asked ""What's happiness for you"" he absent-mindedly replied ""Happiness is when you want to go to work in the morning and want to go home in the evening."" Feeling healthy is like being in control - but not in the possessive sense (even though it IS your body), but as the sure and considerate caretaker of what's been trusted to you. Joints that don't ache, muscles that obey you, chest that breathes deep and sharp mind that's eager to tackle new problems. I felt like this when I went to dancing classes. I really did. Also, half my life I've studied to be a choir conductor and singer. Singing well also creates this feeling. You can't feel bad and unhealthy when you're putting yourself into singing and it comes out good. It's an inherently harmonic, wholesome activity, when you use the entirety of your body (good singing comes from the deepest place inside your belly, down to the crotch almost) and your whole head vibrates and hums. That's the feeling of being healthy, whole. Nowadays, I think the still unachieved feeling of being really healthy is regaining my breath (which got shallower because of smoking, even though I never suffer proper shortness of breath) and being able to run, jump, climb, and fight. (Fighting is there because I think it's a unique activity when you feel your body very acutely and interact not only with another's body, but simultaneously their will and intellect.) Being healthy is being aware, attentive, eager, proud. It's being nimble and quick, economical in motion and enjoying the motion. Being healthy is to stop fighting your body. It's forming a truce with it, and then a peace treaty, and then a fruitful partnership. Being healthy is paying no mind to silly and pointless stuff, and being attuned to big things and to good, intense people around you - because health breeds self-respect and poise, and those breed right priorities. First of all, I would try to tell people, in very simple and mundane terms, that ""spiritual development"" is not mystical hogwash, or magical pact with God, or a way to get rich quick, or hippie nonsense. It's simply a skill and a tool that is no different from any other. If you want to make good furniture, you learn what different saws do, what a mortise and a dovetail is, and how to do a lacquer finish. If you want to live a good life and feel good about that life, you learn self-control, meditation, and philosophy. That's all. I think to further that goal, a learning institutions could be established and instructional programs developed for them. Simple, short courses, with flexible hours for working people. No ideologies, no promises, only tools and techniques and exercises - in self-control, reflection, analysis and logic. If we press this example to a logical conclusion, a set of laws could be passed to make employment dependent on finishing such courses - either government / non-profit employment, or any employment at all. Like in ancient China, where government clerks had to pass an exhaustive standardized exam of their ability with words, poetry, music, and rhetoric to even get the coveted job. There is an online publication, a sort of a magazine / blog called ""Batenka"" ( https://batenka.ru/ ). It very stronglypromotes the approach that I delineated in the previous question. It takes the experience of thinkers and experimenters (seemingly controversial ones, like Crowley, Tolstoy, La Vey, and other famous rebels) and breaks it down into real actionable suggestions for living your life. Another example of a practical approach to life philosophy and health is the Art of Manliness blog, of which I am a fond reader. Both (or the likes of them) could theoretically be potentially be the leading proponents to spearhead the idea, offering it to their audience at first.
 I think that brands like Reddit, Quora and TheQuestion (russian Quora-type service that's surprisingly high-brow, stylish, and curated) could stand behind the initiative in the promotional and community sense, and big software and R&D companies could sponsor it (since they do need the most efficient, content and healthy professionals people in their ranks, not just eggheads). I would need to sift through young(-ish) educators and journalists who are truly gifted with the skill of explaining things simply and being real practitioners of spiritual and physical development themselves. Since this type of people often bounces off the traditional educational system and tries to find themselves in other jobs, maybe the search will be successful. The team will be ""aesthetically pleasing"", underscoring the unity of body and mind, and providing the initiative with an air of futuristic ""post-human"" mystique and good publicity photos. http://www.artofmanliness.com/ One of the best websites about self-improvement that always places the mind before the body and the material. Spirit, values, reflection, and will are the code words. http://tenbullets.com/ Tom Sachs is, I think, in some sense turns the self-improvement into an image of itself (that's his job, he does contemporary art after all), but still he's 100% on point with regards to self-discipline, clarity, mindfullness, and creativeness stripped of any empty pretense and ego. For that matter, I think that the things that inspired Tom Sachs are very important references - things like the Toyota production system, LEAN manufacturing, 5S system, Soveit Central Institute of Labor developments by Gastev, etc. These are all ostensibly just instructions on how to make stuff cheaper and more efficiently, but really are practical philosophies that transform the way people live and approach problems.",Zag,
198765,Ian,Hanreck,ihanreck@yahoo.co.uk,"       a little confused, the invitation to take part talked about makeup yet this is all about health. anyway, my answer whether related to this was: im a middle aged man and rarely or never do i get asked my opinions, stuff like this tends to be directed at 'young people', ie under 35 healthy is happy, healthy is confident, healthy is liking what you see in the mirror. It’s about looking down and seeing your feet not your belly! But there is a difference between healthy and fit. Lots of people are fit as in they exercise and watch what they eat and drink yet get illnesses quite regularly. Other people may not look after themselves in the same way but never seem to get ill (the jammy buggers).
  
 But then you can appear healthy on the outside as in looking in proportion, wearing clothes that fit well, looking after your skin and hair… but inside your body may be telling a different story.
  
 Then there is the brain, physical health without mental health doesn’t count for much. Although Id imagine it is very difficult to look after yourself physically if you are mentally unwell.
  
 I never understand why western culture still largely treats the physical and the mental as separate things. In case doctors hadn’t noticed we are all packaged up in one wrapper – our skin. And the physical and the mental influence and interact each other all day every day. How can they not when we are one being?
  
 Things seem to be changing slowly, for example it is generally recognised mental stress over time shows up in physical aches and pains and illnesses. But the pace of change is pretty blooming glacial!
  
 So for me a big part of healthy personally is being selfish – selfish with making the time to keep myself in working order, that may be time to get to the gym, time to be alone to enjoy my own company, time to spend with the people close to me who I get strength from – until I spent too much time with them then I need to be alone again!! We all need to recharge our batteries, if you don’t do that the engine’s gonna give up at some point!! I would define “being unhealthy” as being lazy, taking an easy option, giving in to temptation, allowing yourself to do something you know is going to make you suffer physically or mentally in the long term just because it feels great to do, or tastes amazing, or pleases your inner demons. You cannot deny yourself all pleasures in life, its too short. Today I was good, I ate very little, I controlled my calories knowing that I should shift a few pounds, and what I did eat was very healthy, and that made me feel good, my stomach was flat, I felt pleased. Then I get tired and feel the need for something filling, so I had a stodgy bagel dripping in butter. In my mind I know I shouldn’t be eating this, fruit would be better, but I’m lazy, I sometimes lack will power and I need a treat, so I ate the bagel and now I feel annoyed with myself but it tasted great. And this applies to life in general, you try to do the right thing, you try not to give in to temptation, but you know that you will at some point, because you are not like the people who abstain, the people who pose on the front of fitness magazines, the people who workout every day, the people who count every calorie, the people who have naturally white teeth, you are not like them and you don’t want to be, you want to enjoy life and sometimes that means making an unhealthy choice. I was approaching 30 (20 years ago!) when I looked in a full-length mirror and didn’t like what I was looking at. everything was getting a bit ‘soft’. So, I joined my first gym. by the way, I was someone who dreaded PE as school was rubbish at all sports and never got picked for team sports, so joining a gym was a big deal.
  
 So, over the next few years I learnt how to use all this weird tortuous looking gym equipment, just to tighten and tone everything up. After a few years I used a trainer for a while as I felt I had plateaued and he made a big difference (the sadist). It has been an up and down journey, at one point 10-12 years ago I did get a bit portly again around the waist. Went to my sister’s wedding and an aunt I hadn’t seen in yrs. went “Oh you’ve really filled out”. that Monday I went on my first diet and lost half a stone before xmas 2 months later and then another half stone after xmas to get back to 10.5 stone which is what I always aim for.
  
 Currently I am just under 11 stone (I had 2 holidays in august and did no exercise so that’s my excuse) so I am now heading back to my ‘fighting weight’ of 10.5. But the difference is even at 11 stone I look better than 30 yr. old Ian, everything is more toned and I do think I am in good shape for 50. Somehow I look 40 (blame the parents!).
  
 It’s not the exercise that’s difficult to be honest – its food. I bloody love eating. I love cooking too so I can at least cook proper food not crap. But then I do have a very sweet tooth and love to bake so it’s a constant tug between vanity and eating. I seriously doubt I am the kind of person that would reach his health nirvana, I don’t even know what that is (10 stone and diet of chocolate that doesn’t make me fat??).
  
 bullshitty phrases like that, they are for people who voted for trump 
  
 What I do know is that waking up feeling okay as opposed to wrecked feels good.
  
 I stopped drinking alcohol last year, and apart from the odd glass of champagne on special occasions, I really don’t miss it, and I don’t miss the awful person I was when drunk.
  
 This didn’t matter when I was younger, I wanted to get trashed, sometimes I still do, but I know now that my body cant cope with it, the recovery process takes too long, and I don’t want to lose days lying in bed because I want every day to be enjoyed and be productive, I guess this is getting older and realising that life is short and I may only have a limited number of years left, and I have too many plans, I have too much to do.
  
 So on the one hand not drinking and not taking drugs is great, but it also makes you less tolerant of your friends who still do, it also makes it hard to be in their presence, and makes a large part of my life which was dedicated to nightlife and music and dancing difficult to do, maybe this is “being mature” which I don’t always like, but I do love making every day count. I would find ways to make exercise more appealing to kids.. not just the sporty kids. maybe things have changed and moved on (im pretty sure they have) but my school experience of exercise put me off for years.  I would talk and teach about mental health from a young age to reduce the taboos around it (its getting better but its a very slow process). I think technology can help, when you are young the idea of getting older and your body not working as well is too abstract to be relevant. If you can take technology and show someone how they would age in different ways depending on their lifestyle would/could bring make it 'real' - you could even turn it into a sort of game to play. Im not sure laws have much of a part to play directly, people generally dont respond well to being 'made' to behave in a certain way.  i imagine indirect laws aimed at manufacturers to produce better, healthier options would be more effective. It would just be nice though if more large international companies took it on themselves to go the healthy route rather than waiting until they are forced to. If they recognised that they had a social responsibility to 'do good' not just a responsibility to shareholder's finances. and by the way those shareholders are also consumers, we arent talking 2 mutually exclusive groups here.  if the industry could get together to agree 1 simplified way for consumers to see at a glance how healthy (or not) what they are buying is - at the moment they seem to treat any labelling as either a another marketing gimmick, a way to confuse consumers into thinking unhealthy products are somehow 'healthy'. drop the cynicism!! Im not a needy person, I don’t like being part of the crowd, I hate that, if I want to reach any kind of nirvana (urgh that word!!) then I am the person to get me there, with the love and support of my friends and my family, but it has to be me that drives that.
  
 If I need outside help in any aspect of lifestyle or health then I would seek information, I would get more than one opinion  even from a doctor, I would also check what I am told, I don’t fully trust anyone, that’s a good thing. Knowledge is power.
  
 I certainly don’t trust brands, even the “ethical” ones have an agenda and profit margins, this doesn’t mean there aren’t products that I don’t trust or services I don’t use, but I don’t fall for marketing spin or pr nonsense, I quite like being cynical, I think that keeps me healthy and is a very healthy trait.
  
 If I needed external partners in a project or to support me would seek out friends with similar views or ask friends for suggestions, I would certainly not follow a spokesperson as they are not me, they don’t speak with my voice and all humans are fallible, experience has shown that when you trust someone to speak for you, they cannot carry or convey your passion and your argument or view.
  
 I think anyone finding true nirvana would involve getting away from the stupidity of society, I think nirvana would come by not using the internet, not having social media accounts and not having a mobile phone or email address. Im 50, i think that in some ways makes you cynical; years of seeing how business wriggles out of their wider responsibility to society, spending billions on convincing black is white, bad is good etc. but then also being 50 has given me the experience and wisdom to see through the bull shit and use common sense!",Zag,
230605,João,Perassolo,perass@gmail.com,"       As I have type 1 diabetes, I'm very aware of everything I put in my body, meaning nutrition comes first to me. Moreover, I also use things on my body - a small device composed of a needle with a sensor is constantly sticked to my arm, so I can easily measure my blood sugar levels. It's called FreeStyle Libre - https://www.freestylelibre.cco.uk . To begin with, being healthy for me means taking care of what I eat, because what I eat will definitely influence in how I feel. The point is balancing the right amount of carbs (sugar) with tasty food, regardless if it's natural or not. For example, everybody says a glass of orange juice is super healthy, but no one says it's a bomb of liquid sugar into your blood stream, and as a diabetic I feel it very hard. So I'd rather have a slice of chocolate pie (see picture) instead, which has less carbs than juice and is more delicious. The result is that my body reacts differently to it, because it's not as caloric, and in the end I feel better even though chocolate pie is not ""natural"". What I'm trying to say is that being healthy means knowing what the food that you're eating does to your body . I say your body because this is personal, not general. 
 Being healthy also means keeping a routine in my eating schedule . I have to have breakfast between 7 and 8, and I have to have dinner between 19:30 and 20:30. My body knows when I'll eat, and I give it the proper time to digest the food before lunch and before going to bed. If I mess this up, I don't sleep well, which in turn makes me feel irritated and unquiet. 
 I guess the way I look when I'm healthy is the same of how I spot being healthy in someone else: not under or overweight, not too thin nor fat. Just proportional.  It's not about hitting the gym to lift weight, it's about being true to the body you have, and not about undertaking great efforts to change it. I associate unhealthiness with excess . For instance, in the Netherlands people drink a lot of beer, even during weekdays, let's say two cans of beer a day, everyday, after work. This surely is inoffensive, but I find this habit extremely unhealthy, because it's excessive, even though it's socially accepted. Also, those french fries cones that people eat in the Netherlands: it passes as okay because everybody does it, it's part of the local culture, but it's basically a huge amount of fried carbs.  
 Additionally, it's not about how I look when I'm unhealthy, it's about how I feel . I've lived years with insomnia, having terrible nights of sleep, so it didn't matter that I was looking great and wearing my best outfits, my mind was terrible due to the lack of sleep, meaning I was unhealthy. I could live like that, have a routine, yes, but I just felt completely messed up: irritated, angry, extremely anxious, and with a constant (albeit light) headache. In other words, unhealthy.  
 Unhealthiness is also about lack of proportion . This will sound prejudicial, but I'm rarely convinced that an (extremely) overweight person feels fine, because his/her body is completely out of any proportion - its formless. It makes me think that something else is going on with that person, reflecting in a bizarre form to his/her body. It also speaks to me of an excess, of food or of beverages, which is usually related to an anxiety. So the whole package is unhealthy. 
 Finally, unhealthiness is about using medication to treat psychological issues that usually are just part of life . I sincerely think that my generation (millennials, born in the 80s) are excessively medicated and have difficulties facing that life will bring you anxiety, trouble and sadness sometimes, and that's part of the game. Are you sad? Think of why and deal with it, without a prescription, because probably your problem is not that bad - it's called life! I'd say that my journey began in 2006, when I started speaking to a therapist. At that time, I had a broken heart, I was unemployed and I had just found out I was diabetic, meaning I had major issues do deal with. I chose to undergo psychoanalysis, mainly because there's no medication involved, it's just you chatting to your therapist, and I wanted to try and live without medication - I was using a mood regulator -  to see what life would be like. 
 Basically I did ten years of therapy, twice a week, every week, and I used to joke that therapy is like a cigarette for your mind. You know when you want to have a break from work and you go outside and have a cigarette? That's what therapy feels like, but for your brain. It kept me focused, and helped me to deal with all the major changes that happened to my life over the years - changing jobs, moving cities, and in the last two years changing careers and moving to the Netherlands. 
 What I learnt in therapy I still carry with me, and that makes me healthy. I deal with reality, I understand that sometimes I will be sad, and I allow myself to be sad, but conversely I also know that sometimes I will be happy, and I allow myself to be the happiest person alive. I learned to deal with my moods, to accept them, and this is what a healthy lifestyle feels like . 
 Another thing that makes me healthy is being constantly in touch with art . Everyday of the week. I need to read fiction, I need to listen to music, I need to go to art exhibits or to rock concerts very often. Art brings me such a joyful feeling that I die a little when I'm not with it. I love being taken away by a good DJ playing techno, being transported to different lives when I go to the movies, forgetting about my own self when I read a book. That's very healthy. :slight_smile: The end goal is to have stability and balance in my life, as much as possible. I've come to this conclusion after having to move several times in the last few months: I had to change houses in the Netherlands, then I had to come to Brazil and once in Brazil I had to go through three different cities. I was constantly on the go, with a thesis to write, and I didn't feel at home anywhere, nor could I focus on the work I had to do. Do you know those people who can bring a laptop to a hipster coffee shop and work from there? I'm not one of them.:slight_smile: So Nirvana for me is having a stable place, because it will bring me emotional stability , which in turn will allow me to work. 
 This meant that I had to gave up the millenial idea of constant travelling, constant moving, constantly changing cities, always in search for new experiences, new people - for me, this is exhausting. This brings us to my second definition of Nirvana: it  is an interior experience , meaning places I can go intellectually, through reading and thinking. In this sense, to write my Master's thesis, which is what I'm doing at the moment, has been a great discovery and a great adventure, and I'm loving it. 
 Words I associate with the Nirvana: balance, home, house, stability, routine, calmness, concentration. First, I would like people to know that they should accept their feelings and do not chase happiness at any cost. Given that I don't see Nirvana as being happy all the time, but rather as accepting the reality and the feelings it will bring to you, I feel my generation (people born in the 80s) should try and drop medication and deal with life. There's one columnist in São Paulo, Contardo Caliigaris , he writes for Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, and he says that's it's better to have interesting life than a happy one. I couldn't agree more. 
 
 As for the business I would set up, I guess it's not a new idea, but I'd really like if people could have access to affordable and long term mental treatment . When I say affordable I don't mean your health insurance covering two or three sessions per month, but I mean a place where people could go and talk to their therapist as many times as they wanted. Sometimes you would go three times a week, but at different moments you wouldn't even go. This place would give you a support, and would be there for you. It should also offer Skype sessions as well, it doesn't need to be always in person. And for long term I mean you shouldn't have to ""get better"" in three months, let's say, but you could just use it whenever and take your time to develop your issues until you're done. Am I being too optimistic? 
 On a more realistic level, I'd like for employers to understand that when people don't feel well for a very strong reason, they should have the right to miss work . Let's say, your cat died, and you want two days to mourn it, so a nice employer would give you this right. Your marriage ended, and you are incredibly sad, so why shouldn't your boss get it? Perhaps this is the law I would pass. My answer is gonna be contradictory, but when thinking of it I have two different approaches: one is more intangible, so the brands that would help me are not necessarily brands in the traditional sense. I think of psychoanalysis schools, specifically CEP , in São Paulo. They offer affordable mental health treatment for everybody, and they have a friendly approach, you don't need to be initiated to look for help. Plus they don't look like a hospital or anything clinical, it's just a house, so the feeling of welcomeness is even greater.   the other is more material. I think of all the publishing houses making books about contemporary mental issues available, such as Ubu , in Brazil. Just the fact that you can read about it helps you in opening your mind to look at yourself. This interview is quite interesting, about how to live a slower life. 
 Also, Karls Ove's books are my favourite in the last decade, because he explores life in every little detail. 
 This book is making me think about the excess of sensations and experiences that is almost a rule to my generation. 
 A very long , recent read about the importance of psychoanalysis.

230609,Abigail ,Breslin,abigail@thewanderlustgirls.com,"       Hello! My name is Abigail Breslin, and I am a Blogger and Wardrobe Stylist between NYC and Nashville.  As a late-twenties woman, I'm really digging into what works for my body both internally and externally. Beauty starts with how you feel, and I've taken it upon myself as a Blogger to research and test different nutri-cosmetics to avoid chemicals. My biggest concern recently was my hair health. I kid you not, my hair didn't grow for two years, and was falling out more than usual. I tried biotin gummies, but I decided I'd rather research which foods were good for hair. Within a couple weeks of eating these foods, my hair was much healthier. People are still coming up to me asking how my hair got so long, and it's hard to imagine the days when it wouldn't grow at all. I'm totally invested in this type of organic beauty, and can't wait to discuss it further! Being healthy is honestly the best feeling there is. When you're healthy, you wake up energized, you're motivated and visibly happy, and you feel confident about yourself. If you take care of your body and mind, everything in life becomes a lot easier. Your energy will allow you to accomplish more in the day. Your happiness becomes contagious to others. Your confidence can bring you to new places. 
 When I'm healthy, which sadly isn't always, I smile more, engage more with others, and feel great about my appearance. It's so noticeable to me my overall glow when I eat well, sleep well, and keep my mind positive. When I'm healthy my hair looks better, my skin looks better, and my insides feel better. For me it's not about maintaining a certain weight, it's just how my stomach feels. If I've treated my body well, then I won't have a stomach ache, and my day overall will be much more enjoyable. 
 I focus heavily on my food intake when I'm trying to better my health. I trade my cheeseburger for a salad, and my beer for a tequila soda. I'm constantly looking up the health benefits of different foods and beverages. I'm also a huge believer in tea to cure ailments. Lemon ginger for life. I've also turned a lot of people onto the benefits of apple cider vinegar. I've been taking 1-2 tablespoons in my water every few days, and even rinse my hair with it when the shampoo and conditioner build up on my ends. ( http://www.naturallivingideas.... ) 
 I think the biggest sign of someone who's healthy is their energy smile. When you're unhealthy, you look less happy and much more fatigued. Being unhealthy is the ultimate compromise of your body and mind. I mostly associate it with eating poorly and not getting proper sleep, but it also comes down to how you treat yourself mentally. If you don't feel you're good enough, or pretty enough, or belittle yourself in any way, this can do physical harm to your body. When you're unhealthy you lose so much power. You initially don't feel well, don't feel rested, and don't feel happy. All of these things are linked. 
 I personally look exhausted when I've been unhealthy. The perfect example is a hangover. I drowned my insides and attacked my liver. It's not only internal, but it's totally apparent externally. My skin looks dehydrated, my stomach is swollen, and my body aches. There are times when it's really hard to remain healthy. I typically struggle on vacations. You want to indulge in big meals and alcoholic beverages. Once I get into this groove, it's hard to get back into a health kick. It really is all about habit and routine. 
 I can tell someone is unhealthy by the same measures I use to gage my own health. Extreme fatigue, less smiling, and lack of confidence. I'm thrilled to talk about my own health journey, because it's something I've only recently begun. People always say take care of your health, but it really didn't become a priority of mine until I was 26 or 27 years old. A lot of it has to do with influence of friends and family, and I thank them for their advice. There's nothing wrong with me by any means, but I'm proud to say I've taken steps to better my overall health. 
 I'm not sitting around eating only salads and drinking water. That's not me. I'd honestly prefer a burger and a beer, but like I said previously I've actively cut back. It's really mostly because of how I feel. Indulging can be so fun, but an hour or two later can make you feel absolutely miserable. I struggle with digestion issues, so it's not something I can get away with. 
 I've been so active with doing my own research about different foods and beverages. I mentioned in my application that my hair wasn't growing. I took it upon myself to learn what foods directly correlate with hair health. My top foods for that are eggs, chicken, avocado, and any orange fruits or vegetables. Within a couple weeks my hair was much stronger. A lot of my friends ask how my hair got so long, and I give them my tips. 
 I don't want to live a boring strict life. If I have to go out drinking with friends, I tend to choose tequila because of the proven benefits in comparison to other liquors or beer. ( http://www.lifehack.org/articl... ) I don't actually believe that the health journey stops, and I think that's a good thing. We should always be researching and seeing what works for us. Not everyone's body is the same, and we all react differently to foods, beverages, products, etc. I think health Nirvana is every day you feel good. There is no quitting. The moment you quit, your body and mind will be upset with you. I like to stay on top of research studies, and I'm really intrigued by all the new all-natural beauty companies that have been popping up. I'm really happy that people are becoming more aware of what they put in and on their bodies. (Fav all-natural products: http://farmaesthetics.com/ ) Like I said, my health Nirvana is a consistent dedication to taking care of myself, and basing it off how I feel. In my perfect health world, I would use more natural remedies and products. I would meditate and do yoga. I would practice spirituality. I think a business that should exist is an only positive news source. It could be a television channel, or an app on your phone or smart TV, or a website. A business that gives attention to do-gooders, health tips, and just overall positivity. This could stem into a larger brand that hosts seminars or trips, and could even make products with the help of health conscious businesses. Partners and spokespeople could be anyone from a celebrity that focuses on health and happiness, to other businesses and brands that promote a healthy lifestyle. I'd love for it to focus on supporting small businesses. Personal blog link about organic shampoo and conditioner: http://www.thewanderlustgirls....

 I coach a lot of people towards their first big race (marathon) confidence and working out boosts sex appeal you see people transform into sexy confident sporty people over a period of time. Sexy is best described ""playful confidence"" confidence alone cannot reach the status of sexy because it misses the game element. Sometimes the game element is inserted deliberately but you when the game element is hidden/unintentional that is most of the time sexiest. 
 Sexy is also attractiveness, you can be attracted to someone or something because it looks and/or feels good, but again if there is a little mysterious touch you feel you are completely distracted and drawn only to the mysterious part until you figure that part out. 
 Unfortunately society is influenced too much trough the media, who tries to capitalise on sex instead of sexy, nowadays almost every advertisement in the media includes a half naked male or female with the most perfect face and body and everything is symmetric, but sexy is to be found in the perfect parts of an imperfect body or sometimes the flaws in a perfect body. I've added two pictures as an example, the first picture is from a friend she looks like a boy , has the body of a young boy, but her eyes are mysterious which attracts a lot of men and women. the second is a random person on the internet he has a symmetrical face and tries to break symmetry in his hairstyle, this asymmetry is the first thing you lay your eye on and you focus yourself 
 To simplify it, if you hand a baby a toy, the baby will play with it for a few seconds and then discards it, but if you keep the toy in front of the baby just out of reach, the baby will desire it more and will play with it longer and tries to discover every part of it. I think the image of sexy I had when I was younger still holds only, sexy has reached the masses making it too common and less sexy. back in the days you had to open a magazine or watch tv late in the evening to see beautiful women or men and there were only a few who had the label of sexy. The internet and photoshop have ruined that image of sexy, the internet gives you access to media worldwide, it gives you a surplus of content which you have to filter yourself. because of that you have been bombarded with too many stimulants that you give up the search for the sexiest picture. photoshop adds the extra problem that all pictures before that weren't sexy enough all the sudden are retouched and labeled as sexy. my sexy bubble was busted in 2007. I was assigned to set up a promo team for the launch of a new condom brand. because we wanted sexy women and men that you could walk into on the streets we posted a casting without approaching casting agencies. the year before there was a girl next door photoshoot from Maxim magazine in world cup theme. we received 15 girls from that photo shoot, only two of the I could recognise from their portfolios. In the end none of them were selected because they look pretty decent after photoshop and also a littlest sexy in those outfits but in real life there there was no sexappeal at all to be found in them. 
 
 
 instruction video how to make your butt stand out on social media I think sexy is still the way it acts while trough the years commerce has changed our view into we see sexy more as the way it looks. Commerce sexy has become too casual and too common. It isn't special anymore and many are believing te same, hence this assignment.  We now live in a world where anything is within reach, either you can buy it, or you work towards it or you create it on the internet. people become to look like lemmings in their behaviour and their appearance, even the ones that try to be different, in the end to be different is after a while also mainstream. sexy portrayed onto products, The apple iPhone is one of the sexiest phones on the market, even though over the years the phone has barely improved its functions. The new iPhone x it is still a regular iphone it has only 1 major new function which is face recognition. Combined with a price which the majority isn't really willing to pay it is placed just out of reach. so my guess will be that it will be apple's new hit. Kitchen aid builds kitchen appliances which still look like they are from the seventies and eighties, their products are modern on the inside with a classic look and feel and bold colours, like their cherry red color or high glossy white, the bold color styles combined with the retro look and the knowledge that it is filled with modern tech make them sexy again.  the iPhone tries to create sexy by keeping it just out of reach of their target market, while kitchen aid uses the good ol' product as a reference which is upgraded with modern twists in design and bold outstanding colours which were unthinkable on the old products. I think in the future we will have a bigger struggle to let something appear sexy, only real sexy becomes more difficult, the current generation has had more changes in the last two decades while the millennials had almost a century of references. and will more likely use the latest changes as a reference point, where sex sells, where nothing is left to the imagination. Standards are high because images are photoshopped to appear perfect, while the human body is everything from perfect. Hopefully future sexy will be defined as confidence, because that is something you gloat and is almost impossible to recreate. I think sexy will be found into action and interaction, As I stated before, I guide runners and see them changing over time, I think the progress made through change is what we shall define as sexy. nowadays gyms are more focussed on selling personal training plans and are moving into the total package like personal training, crossfit in groups, nutrition advice (supplements) and dietary services (like calorie counted meals) all together to improve a sexy lifestyle that boosts your self confidence. 
 sexy in media will not change, the human body is too interesting and watching it stimulates your hormones, maybe we shall look at sexy in a way where the transitions will become more important.newspapers and magazines already deliver extra content only besides the regular content they print. Companies already change from mass media towards social media, to have a more direct message and also a better way to explain their story, this way sexy could develop more significant way of defining sexy. 
 sporting goods brands like Nike focusses on sexy performance, most marketing is made to let women look good while working out, this translates to new trends like the sporting tights as casual wear, women tend to show more curves and they also want to accentuate those curves. all outside of the gym. 
 alcoholic beverage companies will also thrive from sexy in the future, as governments make it more difficult to promote alcohol, they already used sexy lifestyle in a way that it is accompanied with alcohol. Bacardi is a strong brand in such commercials. good life is portrayed as a party. 
 Processed food industry will have a difficult time ahead. The latest food trends are all based on wholesome foods and the healthy and quality products, while mainstream processed food products are focussed on crave-ability salts sweets and grease. the perception of healthy and sexy isn't salty and greasy. Sweet might be a selling point but a sweet girl is almost never sexy. 
 its dificult to see who or which would struggle with the future sexy, I would say companies and other organisations where it is morally not allowed to use sexy as a selling point.

225819,Thei,Zervaki,tzervaki@hotmail.com,"       I have a great interest in edible cosmetics and I use them whenever I can. I strongly believe that food affects health and beauty, skin and hair and more. I tried the collagen gummy bears for example (even if they have some sugar), it was an interesting experience. Some energy drinks that improve skin, bring brain clarity and improve  general health. A few years ago, I tried pills made with carrot essence to protect my skin from sunburn. Wellness teas are very popular in the USA and I actually find them very helpful -usually they have ingredients and herbs for specific issues -digestion, clarity, anti-stress, improve memory etc. I also think that Asian countries are pioneers in this area, like Japan and South Korea. You can find items like collagen pills even at the airport. There is some room for development and innovation in the Western world. Being healthy for me is simply the following: A healthy mind in a healthy body, the famous  Latin phrase  Mens sana in corpore sano  . Thisphrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal. 
 In other words, I believe that it should be a balance between the physical world (in this case our body) and the mental aspect of it (the mind). In order to maintain the healthy body a balanced diet with regular exercise is needed. Each person is different so I don't believe in good or bad diets. If someone is allergic to milk, he should avoid it but this does not mean that milk is not good for you. The same applies for exercise. Running may be good for one but dance or pilates for another. I am trying to keep healthy in my body by doing pilates and dance a few times a week. My diet is simple and consists of good fats (olive oil, avocado), meat, poultry and fish, fresh yogurt, vegetables, fruits and nuts. In addition, I do sauna for detoxing and often follow some sort of ""detox"" diets for a few days only that consist of drinking green juices and broth. When it comes to the healthy mind, positive thoughts, good books and inspiring music are all my daily rituals to keep my balance. For example, one day I may read some pages from a personal development book, another day a poem or go and see a play. They are all rituals that help me keep my mind healthy. Unhealthy is the opposite of healthy, therefore the person who does not apply my personal theory of: A healthy mind in a healthy body, the famous Latin phrase  Mens sana in corpore sano  
When I don't have this balance I feel and I am unhealthy. Usually, that time I don't eat healthy and I have the tendency to drink large portions of alcohol. My exercising routine changes as well. I don't go to the gym regularly and my body feels slow and chubby. When I see unhealthy people, I notice pretty much the same: people who drink alcohol a lot, who eat too much and mostly junk food, who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day. Some of those may still keep  a healthy mind and be still in a good mood but their physical body is not healthy at all. Being unhealthy leads to a series of minor or serious health problems as well. Starting with the obvious of being over-weight, it may also mean regular colds and coughing to more serious health issues like IBS, diabetics and heart disease. In addition, this lifestyle may lead to some challenges in  behavior when dealing with others like for example being more nervous or aggressive.  When I eat unhealthy, I feel the burden on my gut, I can't digest easily and have problems with my immune system with more often getting colds. In order to counter balance, people often resort to vitamins and daily supplements; although this is not a bad idea, I don't believe that is the cure to the issue. Some detoxing rituals may help as well. I wasn't very much into exercising in my 20s. I developed this habit just before turning 30 because I felt it in my body. I started with aerobic classes for fun, then started running and doing pilates, a routine that still follow today 15+ years later. I may take breaks from this routine when I am on vacation but I still do a lot of walking and swimming. In terms of food, I avoid grains most of the time and I am a friend of the primal diet with focus on meats, poultry, fish, nuts, vegetables and fruits. Other routines are some peace of mind for ten minutes in the morning but not a strict form of meditation. Good books are a part of my weekly routine as well as listening to inspiring and relaxing music. The future health Nirvana is something like that: peace of mind, a positive outlook, a shaped and exercised body, a simple plate of food in the kitchen, an open heart.  Peace

If I were to set up a business, I would focus on simple and clean products like for example in terms of food items: avocado oils and paste and sprouted nuts packaged in small, on-the-go portions for everyone. My services would focus on the holistic approach: provide health coaching and spiritual coaching at the same time by offering suggestions for a simpler and easier lifestyle based on simplicity and on the motto: less is more. I am not sure if I can pass a law but maybe some consultations with the local authorities would be helpful. The partners in this effort would be people with the same mindset like me. Those who believe in the a healthy mind in a healthy body motto who would be my brand ambassadors. Some of favourite brands that could help are: The Honest Company, the Seventh Generation, Primal Kitchen and more. My suppliers would be small, local and simple companies who share the same value system like me.

230591,Kate,Monro,katemonroe@yahoo.com,"I think I should be included in this brief because I believe we are on new – and very interesting - territory as far as sexuality is concerned. As virtual reality and artificial intelligence loom on the horizon, I feel like there is a land grab going on for a genuine sensuality. People aren't sure how they get it - but they 'get' deep down that this involves the ability to be vulnerable, that this is what you need in order to find genuine intimacy and connection with other human beings. 
 
  
 This has the potential to be our greatest asset going forward. (As a sidebar, I can't tell you how many times I need to point out to the young people that write to me that the seeking of *genuine* pleasure is what should guide their sexual experiences.....its nothing new that this needs to be pointed out but obviously the internet has really changed how we interact and behave sexually and young people have a lot of corrosive mixed messages). 
  
 
  
 It sounds hackneyed to use the word 'authenticity' but this is what people hanker after, in their own lives and in other people, no matter what - and even if they don't realise that this is what they are looking for! People want, need, and thrive from realness. People are also making brands more accountable now too, because they can. So it behooves brands to understand what sexiness 2.0 is if they want people to buy into their offering. Sexy is a combination of things….it’s alchemy. 
 Sexy is about the way a person carries themselves and exists in this world
  
 It’s so much less to do with physical appearance. 
  
 Looks help, don’t get me wrong. But looks are never ever the starting point of genuine sexiness.
  
 What’s sexy to me is a passionate nature, a person in pursuit of what makes their hearts sing. Because it takes raw bravery to do that.
  
 It’s having the curiosity to go a little further. It’s the ability to open to the idea of ‘playing’ and pursuing different paths, to not calcify in one’s thoughts or actions. To be open to saying ‘I don’t know….but lets find out together’…..
  
 Sexiness to me is about living one’s true purpose. It’s about finding what makes your heart sing and then pursuing that. 
  
 BUT there is a crucial component to this for me. The sexiest person is the one that is on that path – but wants to take other people and help them find their ‘thing’ too. Selfishness and sexiness do not exist in the same orbit. 
  
 So sexiness is ultimately about being yourself, being true to what your ‘purpose’, if you like is, coupled with a generosity of spirit. The ability to support other’s in their own pursuit. It is DEEPLY sexy when another person wants to hold a mirror up to you and show you what your own talents and skills are. Because people being what they are, they don’t always give themselves credit or have the confidence to recognize what they’re good at. The person that see’s that in you and wants to help you see that too? Sexual dynamite.
  
 Side Note: At an absolutely animal level, the smell of another human being can be sexy. On a personal level, I can 100% attest to this from my own experiences. You can meet the sexiest man in the world, but if he doesn’t smell right, ultimately it’s not going to go anywhere. 
  
 This is an evolutionary ‘thing’*. In research, women were asked to smell a bunch of T-shirts that different men had worn. It was noted down which T-shirt each woman chose. Tests were then run. The smells that the women found the most attractive were from men who’s family genetic make up would be of the most benefit to them should they choose to have children together. Put at the bluntest level, this means if I have no history of cancer in my family but there is a history of heart disease, I need to procreate with a partner who doesn’t have the same markers as me, but different ones. So that combined, we will produce the strongest possible child that has the best chances of surviving and living for the longest time. So nature also throws in a random genetic curveball into the ‘sexy’ mix too….
  
 How does this fit into modern society? On the surface, tech entrepreneurs: Elon Musk etc, risk taking men, modern day Rambo’s, blazing a trail, possibly saving society with new tech. Though whether they are lifting others and helping them along in their wake is another question and there is a lot of talk about how alienated and shoddily treated women are in the tech world so….
  
 But the best way of describing how my definition fits fits into modern society takes just two words: ‘Barack’ and ‘Obama’. And for an extra bonus, ‘MICHELLE’. These two embody everything I have written, with bells on. 
 If you go way back (and despite not being religious in any shape or form), I’ve a feeling that Jesus was probably also this person. A person who wanted to lift others with him, non judgemental etc, although maybe he was too much of a do gooder to be truly sexy? Who can say. He was an early adopter of the beard which helps. 
 *non scientific term On a personal level, I can trace a line between the guy I lost my virginity to at 15 – devastatingly good looking, cheek bones, blond hair, long lean tanned muscular arms, French…..He was sexy. But looking back, what I see is a very sexy looking guy. At 15, although there is no way I could have articulated this or guessed what I was being driven by, I think I felt validated by his attention. I was flattered that a beautiful sexy looking guy wanted to hang out with me. He was actually a lovely person too. But I was driven by visuals and we didn’t have a lot in common – or a common language and for me at least, I need to really understand and be able to communicate with someone to know whether or not I actually find them genuinely sexy according to the definition I gave you above. I’m not judging myself for any of the above (or him). We were very young.
  
 And then there was the guy I met in my thirties when I was floundering, who held the mirror up to me and said ‘I don’t know why you aren’t doing something creative when you are obviously a gifted creative person’. This was the most brilliant and motivating jolt to me. That someone noticed something I hardly dared acknowledge myself.  On looks alone, I wouldn’t have picked him out of a line up. But in person? Sexual dynamite. He was a deeply sexy man. Passionate, in pursuit of his own projects but he really got something out of helping other people realise their own. Long story short, 6 months into our relationship, I was writing a book. A year after that, I had a literary agent and was pitching it to publishers. Eventually it was published and I barely recognized myself in the best possible way. It was, to date, one of the sexiest and most fulfilling relationships of my life.
  
 On a more global/societal level, our understanding of what ‘sexy’ is has largely been driven by men/the male gaze.
  
 Sexiness has been fairly straightforward. Sexy = high heels, red lips, pushed up breasts, looking like you’re not thinking about much (asides from sex obviously). I say this non-judgementally! It’s just that ‘sexiness’ has been very binary, very black or white. It contains little or no nuance. It is what it is. Our definition of ‘sexy’ has been the product of a patriarchal Western society and we’ve all been dancing to that tune for a very long time. Its all started to feel predictable and old fashioned.
  
 For a long time, women that tried to break out of this were shamed with the word ‘feminist’. There’s that brilliant Rebecca West quote: ‘ I myself have never been able to find out what feminism is; I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute’  but that’s all beginning to change. 
  
 ‘Sexy’ is changing
  
 Sexy is less about meeting society’s expectations and more about defining it on your own terms. This is echoed in the slightly hysterical talk about millennials ‘having less sex’. They’re just much less concerned with meeting the quota’s that my generation was in the 1980’s (lets have lots of sex, because we can, because we’ve got the pill, because we are doing all the things that are mother’s generation were not allowed to do so LETS HAVE A LOT OF SEX….sometimes forgetting to ask yourselves if it was actually what you wanted. Some of the time it was. And sometimes it wasn’t. Millennials are less concerned with these ideas and more likely to choose quality over quantity because they don’t really care whether you think they’re having a lot of sex or not. They are more confident in their individual choices.
  
 Now our biggest challenge is mainstream pornography which struggles to celebrate female sexuality and pleasure. But the internet is a meritocracy and slowly women are starting to create content and drive alternative narratives around female sexuality.
  
 We are beginning to understand the width and breadth of female sexuality. How unrestrained and naturally explorative it is – if you give it the space and the platform to do so. This is an astonishing report and one I’ve quoted many times. In essence, it details how women are turned on by almost everything, compared to men who have a much more limited selection of sexual ‘drivers’.
  
 https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/05/what-do-women-want-extract 
  
 Freud deemed that a clitoral orgasm was ‘immature’ compared to a vaginal orgasm which was ‘mature’….I’ll let that hang in the air for a moment!
  
 Suffice it to say, these ideas are slowly being challenged. Slowly being the operative word as sexual research is still in its infancy. I’m also still often shocked by how many times you’ll see a woman in the missionary position on telly with a man grunting on top of her for 30 seconds and she, apparently in sexual ecstasy…..the stats on sexual pleasure for women just don’t support this visual.
  
 Sex and ‘sexy’ are inextricably linked and what they ‘are’ is all being put up for re-negotiation. There will be a much more individualistic discussion around what sex is and about what sexy is. 
 The future is exciting. But its scary as well. Virtual Reality is looming and whilst it has the power for good, for a different kind of intimacy, to help people who don’t have intimacy in their lives, it also has the power to corrode, for people to lose touch with more their more human qualities.
  
 On an evolutionary level, I believe that people will begin to understand (if they don’t already) in really a visceral way, the value of connection, of human intimacy and how being the most authentic version of ourselves has a real power (in a good way) and a VALUE. And that what we need to help us be in that space is to be the truest version of ourselves, to make ourselves open and vulnerable to new things, to be able to play, explore and connect with other human beings rather than disappear into the world of VR. Because at the most simple level, the human race needs to keep on pro-creating in order to continue!! But also, we don’t want to become lonely…
  
 So, ee will have a more nuanced approach to sexiness, sexuality and sex
  
 Sexiness is something we will define as individuals
  
 Because if even ‘asexuality’ has managed to come up with an incredible palate of different persuasions within the world of asexuality, then surely so-called regular sexiness can!
  
 It’s ironic that the ‘asexual’ movement is way ahead of the curve here…
  
 Demi sexual, grey-sexual…these are different types of asexuality that intersect with what we think of as ‘regular’ sexuality
  
 http://wiki.asexuality.org/Asexuality 
  
 And so it will be with sexiness, that we will define it in MANY different ways but they will be personal to us and tied to us living a life where we are being more true to ourselves. And not trying to live the lives that other people might want us to live.
  
 I want to say there will be a more female driven definition of what sexiness is but actually, what there will be is just more EQUALITY between how different genders define sexiness.
  
 I find it interesting that ‘pegging’ is in the headlines. Here is the ultimate way for a man to express vulnerability, to be open and honest about what gives him pleasure – to switch or subvert traditional gender roles AND give his partner pleasure all at the same time
  
 http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/sex-and-relationships/pegging-525958 
  
 Words to describe this new world: Nuanced, ambiguous, indefinite, individual, singular, personalized, unique, idiosyncratic, eccentric….except that eccentric, ironically will become the norm and therefore, not eccentric! 
  
 Literal shades of grey (and not that book that does the BDSM movement such a disservice) 
  
 The opposite of dogmatic 
  
 I also think the fringes of, lets call them the sex positive movement…sex educators, the tantra movement, The Summer House parties etc, all these people/groups who would normally elicit shrieks of the wrong kind from conservative quarters will come out of the shadows. Many of them are doing vital, life changing important work to channel new narratives around sexuality and ultimately, what we will come to define as sexy

 Add the Brene Brown TED talk on vulnerability below 
 Link: 
 https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability Give us three examples of what you feel would thrive and why… 
  
 - Women: because we are designed to flex and change. Hormonally, we are, literally made this way in order to help the survival of our species. We are designed well for this future society that is less about physical strength and more about the ability to adapt and embrace change. These qualities are more celebrated in our gender and therefore easier to embody.
  
 - Improvisation classes: improvisation is the practice of being vulnerable, of being open to change. It is about ‘acting’ in some senses but that’s secondary. Its mostly about learning to flex a mental muscle that enables you to exist in a playful uncertainty. So learning ‘improv’ is actually therapeutic.. ‘Improvisation’ classes are a meditation on existing successfully in a world that is constantly changing and evolving.
  
 - Bodies or groups that are not politically affiliated one way or the other but are more concerned with change for good.i.e. Jonathan Wise who set out to bring to the attention of the advertising industry the almighty power they have to influence climate change, for the better, via the advertising they produce and are responsible for:
  
 http://www.lookingupbook.org 
  
 
  And generally speaking, brands that walk the walk instead of talking about it or soley doing it for their CSR creds. People see through that. Brands have incredible power (as we know). We want to see them flexing their muscles for positive change that benefit the population at large and not just themselves. Social media makes it difficult for brands who are not doing this 
 Give us three examples of what would struggle and why 
  
 - Men: because men have to deal with quite historical and sometimes quite calcified ideas of what being a ‘man’ is about and these are not always conducive to change, to making yourself more vulnerable, to being open to playing and experimenting with new ideas. It’s a bigger leap for men. So this is absolutely not a judgement of men. Its just a recognition that its harder for them to change and to perhaps embody what we consider more female attributes.
  
 - Religion: for all the reasons above. So many religions are built on tenets from millennia ago, when we lived in a different time. To admit that things have changed is really difficult for most mainstream religions. This is a bigger discussion for another time and place but I’m sure you understand what I mean. Modern day religion isn’t offering people what they need anymore because it doesn’t appear to be listening and adapting to the very people it purports to serve.
  
 - The left/right political paradigm that we have in the UK and the US (and many other places) no longer seems reflective again, of the people it purports to serve. People are more nuanced and more complicated in their needs. Times have changed and government needs to reflect that and also the natural disparities and differences that we find in people but we are operating under a system that is millennia old and finds it difficult to flex and change course without feeling like it is giving up party politics when actually it should be focussing on doing the thing it is actually supposed to do which is to support people. The theme: TRUTH OR DARE: Do you dare to live the truth of yourself?
  
 I would advertise across all media: print, digital etc and with my unlimited budget pay an expert to help strategize exactly what that media should be.
  
 But most importantly, conceive, build and sponsor a long-term program that enables people across all age groups to become what they really want to be. I think this is especially true for older people. There are a million programmes for young people (they should be included too of course!) BUT don’t stop at the under 30’s. Its challenging for people in their 50’s, 60’s and beyond to make bold changes in their lives when they might have families or relatives to care for – at the same time as living in a society where we need to continually reinvent ourselves, because there are no more jobs for life etc.
  
 Where would you host the launch? Simultaneously in a bunch of interesting cities with some random unexpected places thrown in along with the obvious choices.
  
 Who’s on your guest list of your TRUTH OR DARE PARTY? Movers and shakers across the board – different backgrounds/types – who embody the brands message and feel passionate about it, who will be natural advocate for the brand and what it stands for.
  
 Who do you have as your spokesperson? Lady Gaga. I’m not a fan of her music but I admire her as an artist but mostly, I like what she stands for. I like how she fights for the fringes, how she attracts people who feel marginalized, ignored or different, how she champions those people, takes them under her wing and looks after them. I think she would be an excellent emblem for the challenge: do you dare to live your truth ? 
  
 Writer, broadcaster and transgender rights activist Janet Mock would also be a brilliant choice/host/ambassador
  
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Mock 
  
 Which journalists/media would attend? The biggest most diverse selection of media that would help channel the message
  
 What would your hashtag be? #truthordare of course… IN SUMMARY: The new sexy is about not living other people’s fantasies, its about living and embodying your own. 
  
 I’m leaving you with the words of two of my most favourite recent interviewees. These are for a deep dive I was commissioned by the Guardian to conduct on people’s sex lives across all age groups. These two really stick in my mind. (Please try and disregard the awful click baity title they chose to give the work)

 Matt, AGE 28, more than 25 partners 
  
 
  
 The sex we see in the media is one-dimensional. It’s nearly always penetrative, and that might be how you make babies, but it’s not the best way to make your partner climax. I had an illness when I was a child, which meant I lost one of my legs. Disabled people have a blessing in a way, because they learn that there are lots of other things that you can do that are way more pleasurable. I discovered that confidence is a trick when I was at university. It’s a way of holding your head up and faking it, because women don’t actually care how you look. But I also realised that the best thing I could do was to learn how to make women genuinely enjoy themselves. So much of sex education is not based on female pleasure at all. A lot of men have a narrative in their head about how sex should play out, which ends up prohibiting genuine experimentation. Some men get intimidated by a woman who is sexually empowered or open because it’s not what they were taught was meant to happen. 
  
 
  
 I see sex as play. If you haven’t got many hang ‑ ups, when you’re in that room and you close the door, it’s a space to do what you’re interested in. I think some men are intimidated by sex toys because they make them feel like they’re not good enough, but it’s just another set of tools with which we can give our partners pleasure. 
  
 
  
 I’m at a stage in my life now where, because of my disability, I’m not always able to do things as much as I would like to. But my partner is disabled as well, and there is never any pressure. We flirt and tease each other every day. We’ve constantly got that fire being lit, and the most important thing is to make sure it doesn’t go out. 
  
 
  
 Angela, AGE 61, one partner 
  
 
  
 I have been married for 38 years and my husband is the only sexual partner I’ve had. For the last 10 years, our marriage had lacked intimacy. It wasn’t that we were unhappy, it just happened as it does to lots of people: familiarity, failure to communicate, the omnipresence of children. 
  
 
  
 Just over a year ago, when I was feeling particularly sad and frustrated about this, my husband reached out to me in bed. I think he just touched me. It was as simple as that, but it was as if a floodgate had opened. It was like a thin wall had been there, so thin you could put your finger through it, and that’s all it took for someone to break it. There’s been no looking back since then, and sex is a wonderful part of our lives now. 
  
 
  
 I’m sure it was exciting and lovely when we were younger, but I think it was probably more goal-oriented, and it isn’t now – that’s a huge difference. Now it’s more about being in the moment. The whole body can be an erogenous zone. The mind is an erogenous zone. It doesn’t have to be intercourse. That’s a tiny part of it for us. This is the greatest time of my life, sexually. Everything feels very heightened and real. 
  
 My husband said he didn’t know how interested in sex I was, and he delights in it now. And because I’ve become more open and able to express myself, he has as well. You think, why didn’t I say this a long time ago? Because it wasn’t hard in the end. But there’s no judgment or feeling of disapproval or shock or anything. It’s all just… wonderful.        ",Zag,
230589,Solveig,Runquist,solveig.rundquist@thelocal.com,"My own journey with ""sexy"" has been a bit complicated. I was raised in a very conservative culture (Utah, USA!) where sexy was almost an insult. Utah is largely Mormon and Mormons are all about ""modest is hottest"". Yes, indeed - that's a motto that was even printed on t shirts which were very popular at middle school! Clothes shouldn't be too tight, tank tops and spaghetti straps were forbidden at school, etc.  
 Now I live in a culture (Sweden!) where sexy is a wonderful thing and sexuality is viewed as empowering. Swedes have a reputation for being very free sexually, and they also are a lot more open with their clothing choices. For instance in Utah it was viewed as tacky at best but slutty at worst for your bra straps to show. (Check out this video for a common Utah occurrence...) Even when I went to college in Salt Lake City,  a more open city than the rest of the state, showing bra straps was considered classless. But here no one seems to care. 
 Over the last few years I have been trying to explore my own sexiness and sensuality, find out what it means to me and become comfortable with it. As a belly dancer, sexiness and sensuality is also an issue I deal with constantly. I've also been trying to focus on what I eat to help my skin lately - trying to see if there's an impact of more water, certain vitamins, oils and minerals, less processed food, etc. Sexy is about being comfortable with yourself, but more than comfortable - about LIKING yourself. Obviously a lot of people immediately think of the physical, of looks, but sexy definitely doesn't have to be physical. It's not limited to that. Anyone, of any shape or size and wearing anything, can be sexy. Sexy is a type of confidence, an attitude. Sexy is liking who you are and not giving a damn what anyone else thinks. But I don't mean that in a ""fuck you"" kind of way - I just mean ""who cares?"" Sexiness is thinking you're hot stuff and not caring if someone else thinks so. Sexiness is feeling that ""Aw hell yeah"" feeling. You could get that feeling when you look in the mirror. Or when you say something clever or witty. Or when you pull of an awesome dance move. Or when you break your record for running a marathon. It's honestly FEELING that ""I rock"". 
 I think this is a definition which is becoming more and more accepted by society, although of course there are still cultural hangups about what kind of body is necessary to be sexy. But over the past decade I feel that we have made huge leaps culturally. Now we DO get that any body shape can (and is!) sexy. Now we are much more focused on empowering and teaching people to find their own sexiness than on forcing people to fit a certain model. I think (and hope) that this trend will continue. We will see more diversity in media, in a positive light. We will start using the word sexy about more things and more circumstances, but with a very specific tone - the word won't be ""cheapened"", it will be more generous. My definition of sexy has changed A LOT in my life.  As I said I was raised in a very conservative culture, in Mormon Utah. My family wasn't Mormon but my parents were raised Mormon and so the culture and values were still quite similar - everyone dressed modestly. I was also taught when I was little - not actually by my parents but by siblings and classmates - that ""sex"" was a bad word. Basically like a swear word. From a very early age I learned that the concept of sex, whatever that was - and therefore also sex - was bad.  This was of course only enforced by things like school dress codes and the fact that girls were sent home from school if there shorts were too short - or worse, they had to put on the school's Sweatpants of Shame. I remember that this idea of sexiness being bad stayed with me for a long time. As a young teen at one point I dressed up for fun with some old clothes from a dress-up trunk, including a feather boa, and was sauntering around the house. My mother, simply trying to be funny, made some comment like ""Ooh, sexy!"". I recall being surprised that she would use that word, and almost offended that she had used it to describe me. It wasn't anything she did or said that made me feel I had been behaving inappropriately, but the power of the word itself - which she had intended well.  I don't think it was until college that I really began daring to explore the concept of sexy. I remember that for a few years, in high school, I was intrigued by belly dance and knew it was something I wanted to try. I don't remember the first time I saw it our how I came to that conclusion, I just knew I did. And sure enough when I moved out I found classes - and loved it instantly.  It was new to me, showing off my body. Not that that's what bellydance is about, but you do usually wear just a costume bra up top (with a long skirt), so that people can see everything you are doing with your belly. I am also very flat-chested, have been all my life, so I had to deal with those insecurities. (I still deal with that!) But I loved it and I guess that was the start of my explorations. It continued from there. Then I moved to Sweden and was exposed to a whole different culture and way of looking at things. Sex is treated much more naturally and openly here, not as something taboo, and that affects the concept of sexiness as well. At the same time women are much more empowered here and Sweden has much more gender equality than the US - and of course way more than conservative, traditional gender stereotype cultures like Utah. Living in Europe gradually made me more comfortable with my own body and with acting ""womanly"" rather than ""girly"". I kept discovering more dance as well, and now I do belly dance, salsa, and bachata, and I am starting to explore commercial street dance - even sexier forms, I dare say. I've discovered that I can feel sexy - despite any misgivings, despite things like my flat chest! It's not always - I don't always feel sexy. But I always have the same body, so I know it's not that that is sexy or not sexy - it's a feeling I have. Sometimes I'm on top of the world, love myself, and feel like I'm rocking the world - that's when I feel sexy. And I love it! Ten years from now I think that sexy will be less debated and more accepted.  Right now and over the past few years we have been seeing a lot of positive development in this sphere, such as with Dove's natural beauty campaign, and similar campaigns in media that focus on all types of people being beautiful.  But where we see real progress, in my opinion, is in the everyday pictures and media - when all types of people are featured without it being some big campaign. When companies feature all types of beauty without shouting about it, that's when we know we have made real progress. Right now in Sweden there are still some sexist ads objectifying women, but they are quickly identified and reported to the commercial ombudsman who tests them and frequently has them removed. There is also a public outcry anyone does something stupid like make pink toys for girls and blue for boys (already teaching girls that a certain type of thing is girly, feminine, and later sexy). We are moving towards more open thinking. I think that sickly skinny models will be far less common - but that skinny people won't be shamed for simply having the bodies they do either.  I think both curvy and slim figures will be more appreciated for exactly what they are.Ten years from now I don't think that we will have to shout about what types of great campaigns we are doing, or argue about what sexy is or isn't. I believe that it will be much more spread, positive, generous, free, and accepted - and all of us will be too. Sexy will be inclusive. And I think everyone will feel better for it! I think that companies with a positive, empowering, inclusive image will thrive in this future culture. I think there will be a lot of physical activity, but perhaps less of a focus on gym and more of a focus on fun physical activities that are interactive and social. I think that we will see more gender equality in politics. I think magazines will be less focused on spreads of one type of beautiful people and include more types of beautiful people. I think companies offering healthy and fun choices will continue to thrive. That can include everything from fast food companies offering healthy vegan options to museum that lets the people vote or otherwise contribute to what kind of exhibits they want to see next. Anything that empowers people to feel good about themselves will thrive.  I think that fit fashion will be big (as it is already) - how to feel sexy while being active. And we will see more healthy snacks like dried fruit or other nature-based items - less cookies and things like that. I suspect that the current trend of analysing what is in our food and makeup etc will continue. People will really focus on the areas that have been less transparent - like wine or beauty products. What is really in these? Can we get healthier versions? These are, dare I say, inherently sexy items, but we will want them in a new sexy kind of way - a positive, healthy way. I think brands like Coca Cola will continue to thrive because they have already begun their transition to the new definition of sexy. Coca Cola has introduced ""green"" drinks - which admittedly were a total flop and are vanishing - but I think they get the message, they just went about it the wrong way. I think they will make their existing beloved products healthier without changing its identity, and continue their tradition of positive, feel-good advertising but make it feel even better through health. I think that brands which follow the traditional definition of sexy - focusing on sweaty, skinny, scantily clad people being objectified on glossy billboards or magazine pages - will struggle. I think even Facebook will struggle if it doesn't succeed in turning itself into a more positive, empowering environment. I think that car brands that rely on images of nearly-naked women lounging on the hood will struggle. Products tested on animals will struggle. I think companies that think blue is for boys and pink is for girls will struggle. I also think banks will struggle because there's nothing sexy about them... :slight_smile: And not particularly positive either. Obviously I'm partial, but I would choose to launch somewhere like Stockholm. Why? Because Sweden has always been a sexy culture, but it has really succeeded in making sexy a positive, feel good, healthy thing. I would even argue that Sweden doesn't need to reclaim the word sexy - here it is already great. Here the positive image of sexiness is organic, not forced. At the same time, Sweden has a massive culture of early adopters - Swedes are trendy and love being up to date. This doesn't mean they just blindly follow along with whatever is in, but they do keep up to date on all trends, health wise and fashion wise and in everything else, have an opinion, and adopt the parts they like. Stockholmers are confident, intelligent, open-minded, and absolutely sexy. The other city that comes to mind for me is LA - and I have less justification for that. Perhaps just that LA has always been such a fun-loving, feel good place!  Since I have an unlimited budget, I might to a triple-threat launch, with Stockholm, LA, and one more city - perhaps an Asian or African city. Or somewhere in Australia? I don't have a particular third city in mind, but three is a sexy number - there should be a trifecta launch focused on three cities around different parts of the world.  I would invite people like Elisabeth Gilbert - a perfect example of a woman who is sexy by my modern definition! Perhaps Kate Middleton too - but it would be very important to not just have ""traditionally beautiful"" or famous people, but rather to gather the most confident, inspiring minds from many fields of work and types of lives. 
 Actually, someone like Nick Vujicic or Jessica Cox should definitely be there. Or both. And Amy Schumer, because duh, she fits perfectly. Schumer or Gilbert should be the spokesperson because to me they truly embody new sexy. 
 The music would be peppy, upbeat and energizing but not too loud or abrasive. Uplifting pop hits perhaps -but not gooshy sad love songs.  Think more Despacito than Sorry (Not Sorry). Or The Proclaimers I Would Walk 500 Miles! That type of uplifting catchy song that puts you in a good mood and makes you sing all day. The food would be healthy but unique international tapas of types - it couldn't be traditional in any way. It has to match the concept of new sexy, being unique and fun and confident but not elitist - still inclusive. I would sample unique local ingredients from around the world and have a pro chef hired to combine them in new but delicious (and visually pleasing) way. I'm not sure about the hashtag but I'm considering something to do with moxie. Moxie is sexy - strong, confident, powerful, but upbeat and positive, with some sass. Moxie is definitely a word to keep in mind. Something I wrote a year or so about how bellydance makes me feel, and the community around it: https://www.instagram.com/p/BC...  NOT THIS. So bad: http://www.news.com.au/lifesty... This is extremely sexy - in the traditional way, but also in the modern new way. I mean I would like to see more diversity here, but anyone doing this would be sexy - they are OOZING confidence and don't care what others think:  Oh yes, and bees are sexy too!

300181,Tom,Evans,tom@tomevans.consulting,"I don't think I've ever had a really good experience visiting my GP! Plus, I have private medical through Vitality Health and mostly use the GP app for video consultations.

I can describe how I would like my GP to be though:

1. Quick, discreet, efficient

2. I book an appointment through the app for later that same day. I arrive and auto check in with my phone (no receptionist necessary.) The physical space is minimal and slick, like a Japanese sleeping pod/2001 Space Odyssey. 2 seconds later the app pings me to tell me to go to room X and the doc is waiting for me. She pulls up my medical records stored on the blockchain that I've already given her access to. I describe my symptoms, she diagnoses my problem and shows me the logic/data etc. The interaction is saved back to my record on the blockchain to be shared with other medical professionals of my choice in the future. The prescription is pinged to my phone and the meds are despatched to my home address - they'll be there by the time I get home. The app walks me through what pills to take and when from a compliance POV. Get a video message from her 2 weeks later checking everything has cleared up ok. Slow, old, manual

Lot's of form filling, waiting, repetition of symptoms/problems. No history or relationship with the GP who seems busy/tired. Physical space is depressing, tired, old Woman's Own magazines, kids toy corner covered in germs. People coughing and spreading their illnesses around. More waiting. Embarrassingly bumping into a neighbour and having to discuss why you're there. More waiting. And then more waiting to see the nurse too. Then more slow/laborious interaction to book a follow up or get a referral. Letters through the post. No follow up, aftercare unless prompted. 1 Call up the surgery to try and get an appointment.

2 No. Why can't I book an appointment online? 

3 And mostly I'd be happy with a 5 min video consultation remotely. a Vitality GP
b I'm paying for it and so may as well use it - particularly as its so hard to get an appointment at my local GP.
c Easy, quick, simple.
d I would like an appointment sooner - in the next hour or two. Usually its 24 or 48 hrs to wait. And they don't have many different time options - just a couple. Data privacy/protection, abuse of medial records, data breaches etc.
Solved by the blockchain or other decent security system.
Also, sometimes its great to speak to another human IRL about your issues - particularly if they are more complex or psychological for example. a) I would use it all the time, it would sync with my quantified self data, Apple Health, Withings, Steps, MyFitnessPal etc. and also be a digital medical record of everything that ever happened to me and my family to speed up diagnosis, spotting irregularities quickly and AI suggesting actions. It would also anonymously let medical institutions access my data anonymously to help cure cancer and other big medical breakthroughs.
b) no more form filling, repeating data entry tasks, single digital medical record, integrated with lifestyle apps - data owned by me, I choose who has access. 1. No I haven't heard of them and writing this sentence to hit the minimum ten word requirement in this text field 3. I like it
4. Time saving, the fact that most things can be triaged without an appointment. (as long as the source is trusted/credible)
5. Do I need to keep repeating who I am and passing security etc? I would prefer an app that keeps me logged in. And has all my previous conditions/history etc. 1. Good but kind of old school web
2. better than the waiting room or holding on the phone
3. Feels like something we could/should have done 15 years ago
4. Yes. And definitely for my kids - parents are always at the docs! 1. they look nice. 
2. But architecturally - why isn't eConsult an NHS product? It feels 3rd party - which I'm assuming it is. Shouldn't the service be called eNHS or something? It would need a lot less explaining.",Tardis,

The last time I had a positive experience visiting my local GP was 2.5 years ago. My local practice was in Colliers Wood. I made an online booking for my day and doctor of choice- nice and east. The day of the appointment was a sunny day and the surgery was a pleasant 10 minute walk through a park and, past a water wheel and over a river. The commute was stress free and enjoyable. There were only 2 other people in the waiting room and they were pleasant (no spluttering or loud noises which was usually the case at this GP and would make me feel like I'd leave even more sick!!). There was space to sit, the sun shone through the window and there was no queue at reception. The receptionist was pleasant and professional (not too much idle chit chit and she actually made eye contact!). I waited 5 minutes to see the doctor- record time! The doctor also made eye contact and asked how I was. We exchanged a few travel stories which was lovely, had a super quick consultation, he gave me a prescription for blood thinners and I was off again. The whole thing was quick, stress free, the right amount of casual chat and no sick people spreading germs!!! Stressful, painful and unprofessional

The last time I had a really bad GP experience was 10 years ago. I came off a flight and had no feeling in my right leg. I called the GP to book an appointment and they said it wasn't urgent so I had to wait 8 days to be seen. When I got to my local practice at Maida Vale they made me wait in a crowded room. Two patients were coughing and I felt I would contract something from them! The bins were full and grimy old magazines lay around- covered with germs! I waited 30 minutes to see the doctor. The doctor was stressed and I felt rushed. She accused me of being a hyperchondriac and referred me to a psychologist. She had no empathy and didn't take time to give me a proper consultation. As a result I ended up in A&E a week later with 2 blood clots. I registered with Babylon GP a year ago as I don't like going to the doctors in person. I need to wait for an appointment, attending in person is time consuming and I don't want to be around sick people who may make me unwell!

So now my first point of contact is to jump onto the Babylon app and select an appointment day and time- I usually get to see a doctor within 10 minutes.

I have had appointments in cafes, at work and while driving (I pull over!). I get to see a doctor as soon as I need them, the appointments are quick and prescriptions are sent to my preferred pharmacy ready for collection. I can also read notes of the session.

In terms of improvement- I would love to see my patient notes. The first time I used digital healthcare was Vitality Health. I moved to a new area and needed a prescription. I tried to sign up to my local GP but there was a 10 day wait to complete the process. I was due to fly, needed blood thinners and couldn't wait 10 days. I called my health insurer Vitality Health to see if they could help and they told me they offer GP consultations. I had an appointment with a GP within 30 minutes and prescription ready for collection at my pharmacy next day. No concerns. Some of my friends are concerned about data privacy- but offline GPs store patient details online too so there is no difference.

Other people worry about misdiagnosis but in my experience GPs generally dont conduct many tests- they just ask information so again there is not much difference. I would use (and currently do use) a range of digital healthcare systems for a number of different health and wellbeing related activities including-

Tracking my health
Motivating me to make healthy lifestyle choices 
Ordering prescriptions
Self care
Booking appointments
Getting a picture of overall health 

I would like one system that integrates all the separate systems I use and also offers additional features.
I would like to track my health on a daily basis. The system should include:

*Health questionnaire updated on a 3 monthly basis
*My health age (Vitality Health offers this) based on lifestyle choices. This motivates me to decrease my age
*Annual health MOT results eg blood pressure etc
*Activity tracker eg link to Apple Health data on sleep, exercise etc
*Calories and food diary eg link to Myfitness Pal and also online shopping sites such as Sainsbury's to track food eaten/ordered
*Reminders to order tests based on lifestyle eg for single sexually active people suggest that order online STI kit every 6 months through superdrug- one click ordering
*Nudges/reminders to exercise more/log food eaten etc
*Reminders/nudges to reorder prescriptions eg it has been 6 months since you ordered the pill do you need more now? Press for one click reorder- it will be ready at your pharmacy tomorrow 
*Instant GP appointments online 
*Ask a GP chat room (this is an automated both- if question not answered it goes to a real GP
*Rewards for healthy lifestyle choices eg Vitality Health

The service must have-

*Intuitive symptom checker eg ask a chat bot- if the bot doesnt answer it goes to a real person
*Instant appointments- select day and time online
*Appointments available 7 days a week
*Access to healthcare data
*Remember me so it doesnt repeat same questions 
*Link to pharmacy of choice for prescription fulfillment No I haven't heard of them until now. Are they linked to Babylon? Sounds like a step forward from traditional GP visits but a step back from Vitality GP and Babylon.

Own GP access is great but should also be open to other GPs when yours isn't available to ensure you can get an appointment ASAP. I expect appointments within 30 minutes like I get with Babylon.

Answers by next working day is also very delayed- again I would expect them in real time.

Great to access repeat prescriptions and sick notes but should also offer new prescriptions- I get new prescriptions through Babylon and also Superdrug online. So eConsult should offer this too. eConsult was repetitive, text heavy and seemed to ask irrelevant questions. It also did not remember the questions I had already answered so repeatedly asked the same questions (this could be because it was a demo). I found it frustrating that there was no quick way to do things- such as book a GP consultation or order a prescription.

I didn't like anything about eConsult except the concept. The idea of integrating a Web MD type site with an online pharmacy and Babylon Health type GP services is good. 

I would not use eConsult- when I want to see a GP or order a prescription I find Babylon and Vitality GP better- I can see a GP within 10 to 30 mins on the same day and also get almost instant replies to questions. If I want a standard prescription I can just order directly online through Superdrug- a doctor reviews online and dispenses quickly. If I want to check general medical symptoms- I use Web MD which or NHS sites which are very to the point and easy to find information. eConsult is too frustrating for me to use and the turnaround time is too long. I also can't schedule an appointment.

I would use the website if:

-I could instantly book appointments and choose appointment time and day
-Appointments were available 7 days a week
-There was less information to complete before finding answers to my questions
-Less clicks were required before reaching my goal

If you need any further information from me, don't hesitate to get in touch. The posters are attractive but my instant reaction is that they are advertising pregnancy health. For some reason the logo reminds of a baby or sperm or a stalk carrying a baby. Therefore, I would not read the text as instinctively I would not think it applies to me.

The text, however, is appealing and I would sign up for eConsult if I read the text.

However, having reviewed eConsult, I feel the text is misleading. The text implies instant access to your doctor, which is not the case. I would therefore be frustrated and annoyed.",Tardis,
300182,Lousia,Woolley,Louisa_woolley@hotmail.com,"Understood, empathy, action.

Ive been having a reoccurring problem, not big, not life threatening, but starting to get me down. I've been treated several times for it in.different places and felt like I'm getting nowhere. I spoke to.a nuts3e about some.test results and explained how i was feeling and how it was impacting on my life. I was prerry distressed and she picked up on it and took.thorough notes, asking if she could sum up my feelings in such a way, and booked me an appointment with my gp after work the next night (which was lucky). 

I went along and explained everything again and dr price really listened, he understood the impact it was having and took his time on my appointment explaining next steps. I went out with an ultrasound booked and a follow up appointment arranged. I feel like we will get to the bottom.of.this.

He also listened to my concerns around.fertitily and has since followed up on.them specifically in a phone call.

The gp space is fine, quite nice and spacious. You book in.through a screen but the ladies on.reception.are great - tough gatekeepers but so human too. The chairs etc are all well maintained and you get called when its your turn. There is no tv which i love! Dismissed, bothersome, waste of time.

I went in with a cold and cough that had been bothering me and disturbing both mine and my housemates sleep.

The dr was utterly exasperated. He clearly thought i was wasting his time, he didnt show any sympathy or empathy. He started to moan at me that all he'd seen was coughs and colds which he cant do anything about and this wasnt what he became a medic for. It was unbelievable. 

The physical space there was fine if a little crowded.  Always full and you had your name buzzed up on anscreen which was impersonal and meant you were sleays on tenterhooks and looking up in the waiting room There are a few ways to get appointments. If you want on the day you call.up at 8. Morenoften than not, if you call at 8 you get an appointment that day. You speak to the ladies on.reception.

Or you can book one at any time in the day for later on, but this isnusually a few.weeks away. This is frustrating! You either have those that need to be seen on the day or you have to wait. I would like somewhere in.the middle.  When this happens you are usually advised to call up on the day. 

I quite often use common.sense though and explain.whats happening so the ladies can help me. I dont want to take up appointments on.the day if i dont need to be seen so i hear their advice. Sometimes they suggest that all i may need is a phone call so they either ask my gp or a triage dr to call me.back. if its for prescriptions  etc this wlrms fine and saves me a trip in. 

What I'm really happy with is that if i need i can usually always get an appointment. 

My gp starts at 8 and opens til 6.30 which is convenient for work. It means i often take an appointment with anyone.which can lead to inconsistency. But with the reoccurring issue i have now, i will always be seen by dr price while we resolve it which is a releif. It was a really simple booking system. I used it to book my recent ultrasound. 

The dr refers you and you get a text asking you to go to a.site and book. You had to make the appointment by visiting the site. There were limited appointments offered, these weren't suitable to fit in with work.  So there was a number to call, which i did, spoke to.someone.and got an appointment which suited me. 
On.this occasion the first part was a waste of tie and actually having a number to call would have been much better. I understand that they see people depending on what is being scanned at different times of.day depening which speciaist is working and they want to fill up the appointments to make best use of.time, however for me that wouldnt work. Having the number right away would be better. I worry about my dad and people of his age - there is no way in.hell he could use anything digital and i fear he would be left behind. He doesn't have a smartphone so for example the way i was contacted for an ultrasound just wouldnt have worked - i think it would have really stressed him and others out, even though it woud have been resolved eventually. 

Even for me.in the last instance it didnt work because the system wasnt able.to.offer up the choices that a person could. 

When thinking about a diagnostic platform, i think we're currently using them already for example when you dial 111 the system leads you through questions that wouldnt be that different to what you could perhaps answer yourself to screen. My experience of using that system is that im almost always told to.go to a and e or see a dr. I question how helpful it really is.

The final thing is that the medical profession.is a caring profession - i don't think that can be replaced by machines. In fact when i see someone, no matter how skilled or professional, who is cold (or if my friends do, i hear about it) youre left feeling shaken somehow.  It makes you question yourself. I.can make you feel bad about youself - ive been upset by that sort of treatment. Sometimes all you need is tonfeel heatf and listened to and empathised with. Certainly the good experience i wrote about did all those things and even before insaw a dr i felt.releif.

When i havent been listened to, i think the diagnosis can also be missing - its hard for drs, they cant know everything and sometime must have seen it all, they draw on past experience. However once i attened a gynae clinic and they essentially told me i was making up the pain, even sent me to a psychologist. They were quite clinical. I went to my gp and mentioned the same thing again and it turned out i had vestibual vulvodynia for 7 years! 

Sorry if im waffling, i think what im trying to say is that there is a collaboration between patient and dr which you cannot get with a machine. I find this really hard because  I end up picturing something like the 112 service.

I want something personal, a conversation with someone. I would always prefer voice to typed. Real time woud be amazing, not having to wait for answers. Something like skype but better - totally secure, can show moving images of symptoms.  If im really usingiaginatuonhere then a 3d hologram here, some sort of.scanner woud be the dream! Wouldn't it be amazing if some of the basic checks could be done virtualy too. For.example getting blood pressure taken somehow so you dont have to to in and see someone for repeat prescritions.of the pill every 6 months. To me this feels personal but quick and easy too. I want to see soemones face and reactionand hear their intonation- they're the important things.

I would use it for the smaller things - reoccuring things or niggles you cat find time for with an appointment.  Out of hours too it would be incredibly helpful (but then 112 is for that reason in my mind and they almost always say go to hospital). I still couldnt imagine using it for a lump or anything that needs a physical.check. even a rattly cough because you want your chest listened to. But anything where youre on the fence and vasically dont think it's fatal or dramatic, i would happily use for advice and a resolution.or.for screening. I cirrently make use of my pharmacist in this way. I've never heard of them so question does not apply Brilliant! Looks to be convenient for me and for the surgery - I do like the fact that the NHS could put money elsewhere if this can help save funds for something else. Particularly like that calls are built in so there is a personal element (if needed). Only 30% need face to face appointments is great - that feels like such a saving. I would like the option to have a personal touch, I am a little nervous of 'computer says no'. I think even if it said I didn't need to see or speak to a GP, would I be satisfied? The repeat prescriptions, tests results etc being online and checkable without needing to call is great! That feels like a great service and would save me so much time.

For ongoing complaints, how is it all recorded? I assume it goes on my record? Is there a limit to the number of times you can use it before they call you in? If you keep presenting with the same symptoms for example? Can it cross check previous symptoms or does it just treat each case individually? For example at the moment, I went for physio and they have picked up that I may have an autoimmune condition because I have so many inflammatory conditions. GPs for years have been treating each one individually - could econsult to that?  

I also like the idea that there is somewhere safe and NHS approved as a symptom checker so no more Dr google. For me this looks like a great option, but would old people be able to use it and would they trust it? I would want to know who was resolving the econsult? Would it be my GP or is it another one at the surgery? 

I like the red flagging system but don't understand clinical governance board, what is that? why should I trust it? I found it really useful, I like the concept. There is a lot of information on there! That could be a touch overwhelming for some, but then it's great to have it all in one place (I think). 

I think it felt very NHS, it already felt familiar.

I tested out for anxiety - there are a LOT of questions. I have done these in the past on paper. the consultation online lasted quite a while. I don't think i was expecting an online consultation to be so in depth. The questions at the start I understand have to be there and will be asked each time but they add to the length and feel unnecessary - your dr doesn't ask these things when you go. There is a feeling of irrelevance which is off putting (but not a deal breaker)

I felt the layout could be improved - the menu button was terrible. tabs down the side or across the top would be better. why when you click on it does the drop down menu appear on the other side- it's not user friendly

I would definitely use e-consult if it was an option for me. Getting test results and admin tasks would be brilliant if I could just do this online. I would use the consultation too I think - I would definitely try it. At the end of the day, it would never be that I don't trust it - I can see how it would actually be a benefit. Could it even help Drs with a diagnosis and stop things slipping through the gaps? But it's the emotional response to using it that would count for me. I would only know when I tried it if it would be something I would repeatedly use for a diagnosis. Nice colours. What is the little man though? I hope this isn't rude but he looks really freaky! Especially on poster 3 where for some reason he has tentacles and no nose. I just don't identify with him one bit.

Log in using my NHS login is off-putting to me because I have no idea what it is. The 'how' bit is also very small - unless I was scouring it for information (as I am because I'm doing an exercise) I don't think I would see that.

The messaging on poster 3, find out what is right for me feels weak - I know what is right for me, my Dr. E consult could save you time and get you treated quicker?

The messaging for me is the strongest on the first. It's really selling it to me -it could save me time. the fourth one sort of undermines my dr, I get it having done the research but if I just saw that it would I think undermine my trust or get my back up.

I feel like the trick being missed is the one that I would be most comfortable using it for which is repeat prescriptions and test results. It feels like the least big step.

On all of this I also feel like the underlying message is missing, it's about helping the NHS. ost people in the UK love the NHS, if I can save an appointment for someone who really needs it then all the better.

eConsult I understand is the brand name. However that's also not the most appealing. It sounds a bit dated (although quite NHS). Is there a softer, more up to date description for what they do?",Tardis,

2. This experience of visiting the GP ran smoothly from start to finish – with minimal waiting time after arrival and a GP who attentively listened before quickly being able to decide on a prescription. While the appointment was fast, the GP still made sure to answer my questions clearly and helpfully, as well as pointing out other online locations (reputable sources) where I would be able to gain more information. It was suggested that I book a follow-up appointment in a few months time so I stopped at the reception desk on my way out, and was then informed about the surgery's online booking platform. The receptionist noticed I hadn't signed up for this, so offered me a printout with relevant details on how to sign up. This would mean I would no longer need to phone the surgery for routine appointments – a huge relief and time-saver! 1. Stressful, Unorganised, Unsupportive

2. The initial phone call to the surgery was quite uncomfortable as the receptionist seemed distracted and disinterested in the issue. She initially seemed dismissive of my fear that the issue was considered an 'emergency' enough to grant me an appointment for that day. After further explanation of the issue, I was then given an appointment but was faced with more confusion on arrival. The receptionist was unable to find my name on the system until a few conversations with colleagues (of course heightening my distress) and then I was asked to wait in a room without indication that there would be a 20 minute delay to follow. When I was seen by a GP, I was told a student nurse would be sitting in on the appointment, which while I didn't mind, I would have preferred to have been pre-warned over the phone or at the reception desk. The appointment after this ran fairly smoothly but I was instructed to go straight to A&E – which of course confirmed my original distress and contributed to the stressfulness of the experience as a whole. 1. Until very recently when I was informed about online booking, I have usually always made an appointment over the phone. In the case of emergencies, I always phone first thing in the morning with the aim to get at an appointment as soon as possible. For more routine check-ups, I tend to ring and schedule ahead for a few days at a time that fits in with my working hours and other commitments. I go to a local surgery in Bethnal Green, where I live. Sometimes, I'll consult friends of family before deciding to commit to an appointment. I'm aware that sometimes minor ailments just need a pharmacy trip (sometimes I'll also ask for advice in Boots) and that I can find reliable information on the NHS website.

2. I think phone appointments (for emergencies) are still very stressful because it can be extremely unreliable and a long-process of waiting in the calling 'queue' in order to be put through to a receptionist. This usually also clashes with my working hours so requires me to arrive slightly later or step out of the office and disrupt my work. The online process is much easier as it saves the painpoint of relying on opening times and availability of receptionists. 

3. I would suggest an efficient and useful app with smooth online booking and tracking of past appointments etc - perhaps similar to a fitness app and the ease of booking/monitoring exercise classes. I first heard about digital consultation forms when browsing my surgery's site to find some more information. This allowed me to fill in some details of the issues I was experiencing and made the appointment easier when it came to it. I was convinced to try it because I was initially struggling to contact the surgery over the phone, and was aware that sending the form would allow me to get my experiences written down and then recieve a phone call and possible follow up appointment from a GP. Also upon recently visiting the GP, I was told about online booking and repeat prescription services, so will be using this to making bookings going forward. I appreciate the ease convenience of online booking, but it could still be more user-friendly and more like the apps I use to book other appointments in daily life. My main concern is that it can sometimes be quite difficult to fully explain the symptoms you've been experiencing solely over a digital communication platform. Sometimes having an in-person appointment, or even a phone call, can prompt questions which are essential to an accurate diagnosis. So, while I would use digital healthcare platforms both for making bookings and for advice, I wouldn't want it to fully take over my experience of gaining health advice. I would have a personalised app which keeps track of my appointments and any health issues I may have – including times I've been to the pharmacy or been able to self-help over going to an appointment. The app could also integrate a calendar/reminder service for any medication that I need to take – taking inspiration from apps already created to keep track of the contraceptive pill, for example. I imagine it to be like a personal 'digital drug store', which alerts me when I'm low and can automatically book follow-up appointments, alert for repeat prescriptions etc. It would also be helpful to store any doctors notes and previous presciriptions as well as overall body checks like weight/height/blood pressure at certain times. The app could use location services to indicate my nearest surgeries in case of emergencies, or for more specific 'walk-in service' type of appointments like sexual health clinics. Within the app, it would also be really helpful to see the availability of certain doctors and how booked-up surgeries are, to save on unnecessary wait times.

While it would be great to have something highly personalised, as mentioned above, the main must-haves for digital health care should be an efficient and easy service for booking and keeping track of health appointments. Anything that streamlines the service, to avoid wait times, phone calls and multiple explanations of issues to various members of staff before actually being treated would make the whole system much less stressful. I haven't heard of eConsult before, but have heard of similar services like EMIS. I think this seems like a very convenient and useful service which would save a lot of time and energy for both patients and GP practices. However, I don't feel I would fully be able to make a judgement on the usefulness and trustworthiness until using it. For me, it would depend if I was guaranteed a phone call or not, and if the person on the phone was able to give genuinely helpful advice or not. 

I like that medical advice can be given 24/7 and that it only takes GPs 2-3 minutes to process. It also seems very convenient in that it can be accessed in your own time and from any device. It would be good to know if there are accessibility options – for example a voice recording, or a security measure to allow somebody else to fill in the form on your behalf. 

It would be good to know if there are many genuinely useful prompt questions which can help patients to give the best answers possible. Also, it would be good to see if there are useful metrics as to what is suggested as a mild, moderate, or severe condition, for example. I liked it overall, but didn't feel it was that different to the NHS websites that I'm used to using. While the amount of conditions listed is of course helpful, it can seem quite overwhelming and potentially lead to fear and mistaken self-diagnoses. It is quite clearly set out, though some areas could have an improved process – for example with the children's section, it kind of navigates away from children's issues after initially clicking this section. I like the idea that you can get an email or phone call – both of which may be helpful in different scenarios.

I didn't like the lack of personalisation. I think it would be useful in future to opt in to a more personalised approach which allows you to fill in basic details like age, gender, weight, lifestyle etc – or even have some basic medical history details pre-uploaded to help guide you and make the process less overwhelming.

I would use eConsult in a similar way that I have researched medical issues and filled in online forms before. It can be helpful in place of always of having to resort to a phone call and appointment – especially when you know yourself that you perhaps need a certain prescription but not necessarily to be seen by a GP. I also know from future experience that a phone call can be just as helpful as an in-person appointment and it can make for a much more efficient experience. I generally like the look and communication of the posters, but maybe the icons could be a bit clearer in terms of them indicating a digital service – for example with a phone/laptop/mouse icon or similar. 

The call to action on all posters should be bigger and clearer to ensure people know what to do and how the service can be made available to them.

I understand the sentiment of the second poster about 'time-saving' but I fear this may put people off and that there should be some kind of focus on the quality of the service, in addition to the time being saved. 

Also perhaps clearer communication of the 'anywhere, any time, any device' manifesto would really sell the service better. Many people are already aware that they can get some kind of health advice online, but I'm not sure this is clear enough in indicating that it can actually help with appointments etc.",Tardis,

My local GP surgery has an automated sign-in which I really like. I don’t need to wait in a queue or interrupt someone who is, invariably, discussing their entire medical history, with the receptionist. The most recent time I attended the surgery was for a condition that I get from time to time so I’m pretty familiar with the process. The last time I attended, I explained what was wrong with me and the GP could see from my notes that this was not the first time I had been to see the clinic for this particular issue. As a result, she skipped the examination and handed me the prescription. In total I was probably in the surgery for about 20 minutes total including waiting time. I felt the GP treated me with respect, in that she very quickly ascertained that I knew what was wrong with me and trusted what I’d said to be true. This makes a big difference to me in terms of how I feel about attending the GP and about the NHS, in general. I want to feel like what I say matters and is taken seriously. Slow. Painful. Laborious.
I’ve been lucky enough not to have had too many bad experiences as of late with my local GP. Generally, if I think a poor experience it boils down to waiting for over 30 minutes or more. I had an experience where I dislocated my finger and the time between seeing the GP and the physio meant that the finger never healed properly and, many years later, my finger has a permanent bend in it. The physio was also quite far away which took up a lot of time in my day too. I’ve noticed waiting times have definitely come down at my GP so I’m not nearly as frustrated and pissed off going there as I used to be! 1. My first step is usually to go to the online appointment service but they seem to have changed the software so my old sign in details don’t work anymore. As a result I usually call.
2. Arranging appointments is the most frustrating part of seeing the GP. If I don’t call my surgery at exactly 8.30am then I can forget about getting an appointment. Inevitably, the phone lines are busy from 8.35am onwards for the next 30 minutes or more and, by 9am, the day’s appointments are booked up. It’s the one area of seeing the GP that could use improvement.
3. I’d probably want to use an app to book my appointment if I could or a website for which I had a login/password that was easy for me to remember! a. I was given a brochure by my local GP clinic which invited me to register in order to book appointments online.
b. I tried it out in order to have more control over when and with whom I would see at my local GP's surgery and to avoid having to spend too much time trying on the telephone.
c. Once I was registered, I found it really easy to use and, for the most part, enabled me to book appointments easily.
d. The login was not easy to remember and, in fact, since I last used the service, the software has changed and my former login/password no longer are valid. I wouldn't use one if it meant losing access to my local GP. I would want a healthcare platform that worked alongside my GP. If the navigation was overly complicated and there were too many steps to finding out about my condition, I would probably either try and find a site that was easier to navigate or get in touch with my GP. I want to trust the site too and feel that the information being provided is coming from a reliable and recognisable source and if that was in any doubt, I would seek advice elsewhere. a) I'd use a digital healthcare service if I was in pain or had some nagging questions about my health or physical appearance that caused me concern. I would use it to discover more insight about the issue I was having. I almost inevitably would refer to any images/videos/case studies that bore a resemblance to what I was experiencing. I would seek information about possible over-the-counter medicine and whether there were any local services other than my GP (for instance, physiotherapy/online psychotherapy) that could be helpful. The option to book an appointment once I'd exhausted doing online research would be helpful.
b) Access to my local GP and the ability to book an appointment or, at the very least, be navigated to my local clinic. Some sort of diagnostic tool that would help me to more accurately pinpoint my condition. Videos/Images that relate to my condition are essential (I usually use google images when I'm self-diagnosing). 1. No, I haven't heard of them before.
2. Not applicable. 3. Sounds like a great service that can drastically cut down on the need for an appointment and, hopefully, stop people attending their GP Surgery for an issue they can have dealt with via eConsult. It sounds like it could be really helpful especially for younger, working people to avoid them having to take extra time off work for doctor's appointments. I've noticed how technology, in more general and simpler terms, has sped up waiting times in my local surgery so I'm usually in favour of technology that improves processes and makes businesses more efficient.
4. I like the fact that it can speed up finding a solution to my query and possibly avoid me having to see my GP. I don't like that it's so impersonal and that there's no continuity of service. I wonder about trust and data protection and I worry about my health records being open to hacking. 
5. I'd like to know more about data protection, how I know the information I provide is safe. I'd like to know if it's more suitable for certain conditions than others. I. I got the hang of it fairly quickly but took a while to figure out the navigation as I'm working from a 13"" laptop and couldn't see beyond the main four boxes on the screen at the start. Overall, I found it could be more intuitive. I liked the body map and the universal search. I wasn't so keen on the four main boxes and then all the directory below.
2. I liked the fact that I could access in one place - information regarding my particular issue, linked pages with more extensive information, possible over-the-counter drugs, other services that I could go to for help and advice. I liked the fact it pulled together everything in one place - advice, appointment bookings, sick notes, help for my child. 
3. I didn't like the fact that once I'd chosen to seek more specific and personal help, the questionnaire seemed quite long and because it didn't give me the number of steps, it felt like it went on forever!  Anytime I filled in a form, I would have liked to know the number of pages in the form so I knew how long it was going to take to finish. It felt like I had to repeat much of the same information and I wondered why this couldn't be stored (gender/date of birth, etc.)
4. Yes, I definitely would use it. I would use it for general and more specific issues. I would use it for advice and also to find specific services. I noticed that I could access physiotherapy without needing to see a GP, for instance. I never knew that! The bottom row on the left really resonates with me and the proposition. It's the clearest in terms of messaging and in terms of letting the patient know that the site can save having to contact a GP. The bottom right feels slightly passive-aggressive!  Top right is another favourite. It's friendly while conveying the more serious message that GPs are busy people and that some patients can self-diagnose. I wonder if, instead of the word self-care, self-diagnose might be more applicable?? The top left poster suggests that you can speak to an actual doctor using the website which doesn't feel accurate, based on what I've seen of the website.

Although I'm not a great fan of cartoons or illustrations in this style, they're fairly innocuous. The colours seem clear and easy to read although I had to zoom into the info bottom right. I'm assuming that at scale it would all be clear. There is trustworthiness about all of them while not appearing to patronise.",Tardis,

2. I don't go to the doctors that often but I had to go to visit the nurse for a routine test and was able to organise a prescription at the same time which was super efficient. 

The positive side was that the receptionists were professional and made sure that no one overheard the conversation I had with them. They had all my records up-to-date and answered my questions. In the super clean and spacious waiting room, I only had to wait 15 minutes. 

The nurse was quick and rapid in doing the test. She explained certain health concerns I had and made suggestions but also worked with me to think of exercise/diet improvements that could be easily implemented, so it wasn't a lecture but more of a co-creation/collaboration exercise. She was also flexible and allowed me to request a larger pack of pills than normal because I am travelling. She also did not ""beat around the bush"" and told me directly that I had gained a lot of weight in a short space of time and this was a concern. 

Afterwards, she went straight out of the room to get the doctors signature on the prescription and alerted the receptionist that they had to get this done quickly and that it was for me without any of the patients knowing. 1. Disconnected, siloed, and lengthy

2. In the same visit I was given a repeat prescription. However, the computer system did not alert the nurse that this prescribed drug had been discontinued. Instead of getting the prescription signed immediately (I think nurses should be able to prescribe the contraceptive pill), I had to wait for a doctor to sign it. Neither the doctor or nurse picked up on the fact that this prescription was discontinued. 

I went over to the pharmacy with the prescription and after waiting 15 minutes they mentioned that they did not have it in stock. Perhaps another pharmacy has it. So, I had to head back to the GPs and explain the situation to the receptionist who explained it to the nurse who then went to the doctor etc. Several phone calls later and I had a prescription for a contraceptive that existed but for fewer pills because they wanted to ""try it out on me"" first. So, then I had to go back to the pharmacy for a prescription for a contraceptive pill that might run out mid-way through my travels. 

I can't really say that this was a really bad service but the poor communication/sharing of information between the pharmacy and the GPs made my appointment 2 hours instead of 15 minutes. It also made me less trustworthy of the computer system used by the GPs because why isn't it flagging the prescription of discontinued drugs. 

One thing that does irk me about my GPs is that I can't make appointments online (only via phone during practice hours and often the line is busy) and I need to drop off prescription requests in person with a note and pick them up later. 1. Telephone call with the receptionist during surgery hours and it usually takes several rings to get hold of them. Then I have to to manually put the appointment in my calendar. 
2. Honestly, I would like to anonymously book my appointment online stating what the issue is and what I think I need. Then I am given a range of appointment times to select. I can then receive an alert 5 mins before the doctors is free then when she is free so I don't need to wait in the waiting room. I can be outside. Ideally for repeat prescriptions I would like to go to any doctors (not just my own) and they would be located in locations I transit e.g. train station, local supermarket etc., or I can get the repeat prescription directly from my pharmacy. I also would like the nurse to be able to prescribe. Afterwards, I would like to receive a feedback form for electronic feedback e.g. requests such as bigger prescription. 
3. Complete co-ordination between the computer system at my GPs and the pharmacy so that everything on my prescription is filled out and I just need to go into any pharmacy at any time and give ID and a code word and I can get my prescription and ""top ups"" if I run out. I don't understand why I need to visit the nurse for health checks for the pill when a pharmacy could do BP and weight. I also don't understand why their computer systems are not aligned and synched.  My biggest concern is doctor competence. Getting advice from a medical professional who does not know my medical history is a concern, especially if they aren't doing any follow up and there is no accountability. 

Another issue I have is outsourcing. If they are based in the UK they are operating under UK laws. What happens if the medical professional is located overseas in a country with less stringent medical malpractice laws. I would only want advice from a medical professional that understands British culture or has been trained in the UK. I have been lucky in that I have only been treated by good doctors overseas. Although, there was one doctor in the US who I felt was more interested in money than patient care. My concern with a digital private service is the motivation of the doctors and their level of English too. 

A big concern is checks. If for example I was getting advice from a doctor, would they have a nurse or pharmacist checking their advice. 

I am super concerned about data privacy. If the digital healthcare platform is based outside the UK and there is a data leak are they liable for costs of that leak. Also, what if the data is sold to an insurance company if the digital healthcare platform company changes ownership. It is the same concerns that I have with these DNA testing kits. Situation 1. I am travelling overseas and need an emergency prescription. From an app on my phone can contact my GP online via a platform and using a secure password and get a digital prescription. The GP contacts a private doctor overseas to confirm this and I am able to pick up my prescription and medication in any pharmacy on my travels and use the app to claim on my travel insurance, if the case is valid. 

It must have a seamless user journey; it must be in a block chain with every action tracked and traced; and it must have guarantees on data privacy and usage. It should have a one off fee of around 50 pounds - more if I can claim on a standard travel insurance policy. This must be validated by the BMA. 

Situation 2. My Mum is expressing concerns about her recovery from medical treatment. I would like to book her video time with a consultant who can review her case and talk to her.

This must be completely confidential. This must include a review of case files and be reputable by the BMA. There must be an option that I can pay for this service, max 200 pounds. 

Situation 3: I am able to get repeat prescriptions at ease and get them anywhere in the UK

This must be trackable and traceable. This gives me and the GPs a digital record. We both own the data and it can't be sold or passed onto third parties. It is encrypted. It costs no more than a few pounds per use. 1. No, I have not. Maybe this is because my home base is in a small town in the North of England. Has it just been trialled in large cities or more progressive GP surgeries? My surgery is quite old school but they have a reputation as being the best one in the town and have the least complaints about them. 
2. Same as above. 3. Yes, this hits the mark and would make my life much easier as a self employed person. 

4. This is the biggie for me - ""Request sick notes, repeat prescriptions and test results without the need for an appointment"" It would save me a lot of time visiting the GPs for a repeat prescription which I could use for other things. I also like the idea of test results through the app. I am currently using my parents address as my home address while I sort out where I am going to live next. This means they open my post when I am away consequently they get my test results which I feel violates my privacy but I can't wait to be home to open them because it might be weeks later and it causes them undue stress. 

I love the idea of 24/7 medical advice. I need it when I think I might have something more serious than the flu or a cold but I am too unwell to go to the surgery or potentially too contagious. When I have a fever, I am delirious and just need some reassurance, especially if I am overseas on vacation or for work. 

I don't like this - ""A response by the end of the next working day or sooner"" in case I have something like meningitis or septicaemia. Could certain things be ""flagged"" to the medical practitioners in case it is of concern?

5. Can you tell me more about this - ""Continuity of care from your own GP practice – with the convenience of online access""?
Is the app used to get patients to do certain actions and remind them and monitor their progress?
When is a phone call needed, face-to-face, video call or self-help? When will a patient's intuition override the doctor's advice?
Will you monitor cases where something is chronic and there is the same issue repeatedly and the same advice given? What is the ""cut off"" point here?
Can I use this service from overseas or do I need to be physically in the UK when I am using it?
Are all the medical advisors UK-based and operating under UK law? What checks and training do the medical advisors have for this service? 1. I found it to be super intuitive. 
2. I like the familiarity of it. The text used is the standard text on the NHS website, which was great and most things were straightforward. 
I love the red warnings that pop up when you need to get emergency treatment. The use of colour and red was powerful. 
I think it is mobile compatible. I could not test it fully but it looks like it could be. Are the options touch-compatible?
3. I think it was too text heavy - some diagrams would help especially for signs and symptoms and also for progression of what to do; an overview at the top and more depth at the bottom; and I feel a pyramid/diagram of progression is needed e.g. contact GP then 111 or whatever order is needed. I have no idea if I need a pharmacist, GP or 111, especially if I am ill. Also, icons - an underrated and universal language. 
More questions - is the website hearing accessible (especially the videos)? What about bling people etc.? 
A biggie - are you user testing with the oldest generation that has access to a device e.g. there are 90 year olds with ipads - definitely test with them?
You can't ask a gender and just have male and female as options without non-binary and choose not to disclose as options as well. 
I would love to have the option to click on multiple symptoms that I am feeling all at once without having to read the question and then the answer for all of them for sinusitis. 
I am not sure if there was a feedback option or improvements to the site option. 
One thing I forgot to check (and I am kicking myself for it now) is can I download my answers and take them to the local pharmacy if I want some face-to-face advice. This would be super useful for me, especially if I have lost my voice. 
Can there be a minimal number of options to select to get an answer? I had a lot of options for sinusitis and it would be great if there was less or there was tinder swiping. 
I need to investigate more how good the site is at identifying drug-drug interactions. 
4. Yes, I would for my parents. This is why I was surprised there was an option for parents of children to select a box but not for people who are caregivers of elderly parents. 
I would use it if I was overseas. I wonder if there is an option to find out the foreign equivalent of certain drugs. I remember overhearing a conversation between some Americans about the British equivalent of some drugs. 1. I like the simplicity of the posters and bold text and simple imagery. I find the layout not very intuitive and the images don't resonate. 
For the top right hand poster is the most compelling because it is all about ""self-care"" and ""saving time"". Two key words in my life and I like the idea of it being a win-win for me and the GP. I would love the images to represent connection and the win-win. I don't feel that they do. 

2. The key information on the posters - go to practice website and click on 'Contact your doctors online' is in super small text with no icon for click, which would make things easier. I would put the QR code under the instructions text with it clear that there are two options to access e consult. Looking at the image, I would swop the e consult logo with the QR code icon putting the QR code icon under the instructions. 
Above the instructional text I would have in big font ""How to Use"" or something similar. 
Maybe you could highlight that it is a free service. 
I am not sure of the rationale behind the tear drop illustrations or the additional one in white. Maybe you could use an illustration that demonstrates connectivity between the patient and medicine/the medical practitioner. 
If there is space/scope, could you A/B test with and without a recommendation quote. This would be super interesting to see what clicks with people. 
White text on a red background is easier for me to read that the text on a green or blue background.",Tardis,INTJ
225799,Isabelle,Hierholtz,isabellehierholtz@hotmail.com,"Please.see.below. your interface is super hard to use on mobile!!! Here you go still have to add words to avoid error message... Little elephant door stop. It was custom made for me one Christmas with its upwards trunk! Most of these are usually done in large size and impossible to hold. This one I can wrap my hand around it's middle. It's at my scale. 

Gold horse head vintage cufflinks that belonged to my Mum. Much smaller than regular cufflinks, they feel very feminine and again at my scale. Most items especially handbags and statement rings and necklace always drown me in scale. I don't like to feel like a small child trying on her mother's clothing! :) 

have also attached random photo of hummingbird as your app is insisting on 3 pics. :) it's small and so gorgeous as well as surprisingly territorial. I feed them sugar water. Orange kid leather jacket. Need I say more? It's soft as butter. Saw it in a random shop window in midtown Manhattan at closing time. It was 70% off closing down sale. I've had it for 15 years.   

Hot pink Michael Kors handbag. The small sizes one! It was my Xmas present to me last year. It's got little metal feet so the bottom doesn't get scuffed. Love that kind of attention to detail.

Another bonus  pic as the app is still insisting on 3 shots! :) Haflinger felt slippers. Not leather but they are cute and beautifully crafted. Vintage Persian rug. Should be hanging on wall. The feel under bare feet is heaven! So silky. It's handmade and there are tiny imperfections designed into the pattern to remind us that it is made by man and therefore imperfect. It's luxury because of the materials, the quality of workmanship and the attention to detail  (in build tiny flaws in design).

La Perla body lingerie. It's cream lace all over the front and a satin back. It is also very comfortable and offers good support in the bra department. Ultimate luxury is beauty and functionality integrated in design. Japanese packaging falls into that category! Vintage small Louis Vuitton traveling case. It's gorgeous and unusual. Don't see too many around. Luxury is also about rarity or uniqueness. I travel as light as possible. House Keys.(so I can go home) clutch wallet (to pay for stuff and carry ID). Pen (how analog!). Phone (So I can call an Uber). Tampons. (So I dont get stuck.but also to help another woman out who might be stuck without one). Tissues (allergies). PS Can't include phone as am taking picture with It! Samsung S7 handmedown. A. My engagement ring. B.I designed the setting. C. I chose the stone with the highest level of purity even though it wasn't the largest one. I care more about how it makes me feel than what others may think of it or of me. D. I wear it all the time. Luxury is about wearability and  durability. Otherwise it's a museum piece and it is an inanimate object. Luxury comes alive when its worn. E. I would make the diameter of the ring smaller as the weight of the stone makes it spin around my finger rather than staying upright. I grew up with all my clothes custom made. I am used to things fitting perfectly, when they don't they feel more manufactured, less crafted. Respect for the environment in sourcing materials from nature or from suppliers and in crafting them.",Stitch,
230603,Susan,Schell,susankristinaschell@gmail.com,"1. I picked this 14k Leo pendant from the 1970's that I wear absolutely every day. The story of why I bought this is a little bit funny but it makes me feel like I was ""meant"" or ""destined"" to have it (haha - this sounds so dumb). I had found this vintage pendant on eBay and had been hesitating to buy it. I was just watching it, as it was a little more expensive than what I wanted to pay at the time. Then one night, I had this dream that the seller had changed the price and someone else had bought it out from under me. This is a little dramatic, but I woke up really upset from the dream, feeling like I was missing something important, and quickly checked on eBay. The seller had indeed dropped the price a bit (not as much as in my dream, but still!) and I bought it right then and there. It was just so weird that I knew the price would drop and I just felt compelled, or like I was supposed to have this thing...so it was fate! Or I have psychic dreams hahah, I don't know, it is silly, but I feel more connected to this necklace somehow because of this dream. Also, I know it is suddenly very popular (huge trend in jewelry especially) again but I have always been fascinated by astrology and I think this interest is not so much that I truly, deeply believe in it, but I think the concept is kind of beautiful - that we are all somehow connected and have these similar experiences through life, based on the stars and where/when you born. I just really like the concept (not looking at it in a scientific or very serious way.) I also really like to jokingly excuse my behavior by saying ""As a leo..."", it really makes me laugh. I chose this to represent me because I think it shows a lot about my character, not just that I am a leo, but the story behind it kind of shows the importance that I place on dreams or feelings that I have, that I really try and listen to myself, and that I have a hard time making decisions without some kind of ""sign.""

2.  This is kind of cheating, but I am showing two rings that I designed at my old job in NYC. The top ring is a 14k labradorite and opal ring that was part of a code word collection that we did that was inspired by Victorian jewelry that had secret messages written out in stones - for example: Ruby = R, Emerald = E, Diamond = D, Turquoise = T. So, I chose this ""code word"" because I was talking with a coworker on G-chat and he asked me what word I was going to get and I responded ""I don't know, LOL"" and as soon as I sent that I started thinking that LOL would be ""Labradorite, Opal, Labradorite."" Labradorite and opal just happen to be my some of my top favorite stones so it just seemed perfect and funny. It makes me smile whenever I look at it. It is again a little bit silly, but I like things that have a sense of humor and meaning to them. The bottom ring is an 18k all opal band (from the same collection technically but the message would be ""OOOOOOOOO"" haha) that I am just in love with and I feel naked without these two rings, I usually wear one on each pinky and they are part of my everyday look. These make me happy because I worked on them and I love how they turned out. I am proud of them and they incorporate some of my favorite materials and the message of LOL is just funny to me, it is like a secret that no-one would read, but I know it is there.

3. All my objects are jewelry, which makes sense because as a jewelry designer, jewelry is what I am most passionate about. I think the thing that draws me in the most about jewelry is the inherent meaning (or value) it can carry in addition to being made out of precious materials. Jewelry is super sentimental, it is worn close to the body, and it is often a (long lasting) gift from loved ones. These little 18k Colombian guys with emerald bellies used to belong to my mother. We lived in Bogota, Colombia back in the early 2000s and as Colombia is famous for its emeralds, my mom wanted to buy some jewelry while she was there. She bought two little ""people"", one to represent myself and one for my younger sister. She used to wear these all the time and a few years ago she gave them to me! So, now I wear them on a little rope chain, like she used to, or I sometimes wear one on each hoop of earrings that I also got in Colombia. This is a good example of my passion for the meaning in jewelry, the story behind each piece is what makes them so special. 1. This is a little jewelry bag from Tous that I actually use as a coin purse. I hate having change floating around in my bag and its annoying to put it in wallets. So I like to use this tiny bag, it fits perfectly in every bag and is easy to find when digging around in my purse. Again, this is just a really perfect size as it fits all my change but isn't too bulky. 

2. The is like my actual jewelry bag for when I travel. It is lightly padded and it fits a little cardboard jewelry box perfectly so I use this keep my jewelry safe while traveling. I think this is a really good size for a small bag - you could use it for many beauty supplies while traveling or just a place to keep little things safe. I think its really cute and the size is unique but good for protecting little delicate things. 1. My John Paul Ataker ostrich leather wallet. I chose this wallet because I really feel like it is exactly the perfect wallet size. It has a lot of storage but doesn't get bulky. Wallets are hard to get right and I really feel like this one works well for me, it fits all my cards and has good spaces for cash on the inside. I like that this is small because it can easily fit in my coat pocket or in my smallest purse/clutch thing. It is very convenient to carry around but has enough space for everything I need (and more!) The leather feels nice and like it is well made, I am not a huge fan of the color but it was a gift so I can't really complain and its pretty neutral. It being leather doesn't really make a difference to me except that I just hope it lasts me a long time. 

2. My leather shiny boots - these are really nice quality boots, they are super comfortable and a great walking all over town shoe. I usually tend to ""kill"" my boots, I walk a lot and really wear my shoes down but these have held up quite well after a year of heavy use. These being a shiny/patent leather, they are a bit more high maintenance, so I do spray them and take care of them with the product the company I bought them from recommended. I think with shoes, real leather is more important to me. It is important because of comfort, function, sustainability. Many fake leathers on shoes have been problematic for me in the past and do things like ""peel"" or rub off in weird ways and it just kind of feels like a waste of money and materials. I do think there are good vegan leather alternatives that I could be just as happy with, but I don't find many brands using high quality ones (especially in shoes.) 1. My David Yurman 14k, sterling silver, and amethyst bracelet. I would consider this a luxury item because it is a designer, stamped/numbered piece, and it's retail price exceeds the value of the actual materials (significantly). Every brand of course has a mark-up, but I think luxury tends to add a mark-up for the idea of wearing/owning something from that brand when they consider their pricing. I would nonetheless consider David Yurman to be very ""attainable luxury"" because the prices aren't completely crazy and it is still decent quality materials (the sterling silver here is the not ""super valuable"" material, but still better than plated brass or something.) It is luxury because it is at a price point which is not accessible to everyone, there is extensive know-how in the technique for developing their signature cable wire, and it is made of some precious materials. 

2. My Chelsea and Walker sand-washed silk blouse with metal snap detailed sleeves. This is a luxury item for me again because of materials, design, and price point. The brand is very much about details in their designs and have a cool slightly feminine yet more androgynous vibe to them - it is a very clear and consistent aesthetic. The carefully considered design details are very obvious in each piece by them and I think that makes this feel more luxurious as well. The silk is just also excellent quality, so it just feel great when you wear it or touch it. 1. My John Paul Ataker ostrich leather wallet. It is small, leather, and from a luxury brand. This brand is a made to measure, almost couture-like (but not haute couture level and not in France) company, everything is custom and tailor-made. It is primarily an evening gown brand. I am not even sure that they sell small leather goods normally, perhaps they have a small collection just in their NYC store because I can't find any of them for sale online - so it does also have that exclusivity factor! It is very soft, seemingly high-quality ostrich leather with nice and clean stitching. 

2. This belt is small and leather but not exactly luxury - it is just the only other small leather thing I own (besides the boots I already showed.) It is a small cow leather belt made in Belgium for Galleries Lafayette (so for sure not luxury, as it is the department store's own brand.) The leather seems fairly nice and sturdy - the plating on the buckle however used to be gold and has clearly worn away with frequent use...even high quality plating isn't going to last years but this rubbed off in maybe 6 months of use. Everything inside my bag: Chapstick, a white pill case with ibuprofen, floss, a mini toothbrush, an earplugs case, headphones, a hair clip, a book, a water bottle (with bonus hair tie around it), an umbrella (this is the only thing is not always with me), a hair brush, two pens, my metro card, a pink emergency feminine product bag, a gold business card holder, my little pouch where I keep my wallet, keys, coin purse, and a bit of make up. 

These seem to be the perfect supplies to bring with me for pretty much every situation. The hair brush, make up, and dental care items are all for ""in a pinch"" moments and things like ibuprofen and earplugs are more ""just in case"" items. 

My minimal ""cannot leave the house without"" items are the chapstick, water bottle, keys, metro card, some hair clip or hair tie, and the wallet. a. My 18k Opal ring
b. I designed it two years ago and actually picked it up from the jeweler on my birthday. 
c. I think this is special to me because I designed it, it was part of this big collection we were doing at my old job, and I love opals so I wanted something with a lot of opals. 
d. I wore it yesterday, it makes me feel great! I hate not wearing it when I am out, for example I had a hand photoshoot on Friday and obviously couldn't be wearing my own rings - my hands felt like they were missing something. It makes me feel naked or like I forgot something important when I don't have it - I sometimes forget that I didn't put it on and it makes me panic for a second when I don't feel it on my finger. It is very important to me!
e. The one thing I would love to change about this is that because of the design (which I obviously like because I did it haha) it has a lot of flat surface area, which means it is a lot more metal than a normal eternity band, but the downside to this is that it gets dirty rather quickly with everyday use. And it is difficult to clean so I would love for that to be different. I think transparency is really important to me and my generation (millennials). Transparency to me means that a brand is really honest, honest about where their materials come from, how they are made, how their employees are treated, and so on. I think in fashion there is so much trickery, there are so many words and phrases that are used to trick the client - ""made in Italy"" for example conjures notions of an expert Italian artisan, hand crafting something in a rustic but beautiful workshop, when in reality ""made in Italy"" can also mean it is made by underpaid and exploited immigrant workers in very scary leather tanneries, in bad working conditions with toxic chemicals and very dangerous machines. (Check out the documentary by France 2's ""Cash Investigation"" program for many examples of this, I think it is only available in French but very informative.) Luxury has the price point where it is inexcusable to not take care of their employees and to not be responsible for knowing where their materials come from and how the people and animals who are involved are treated. With this in mind, I think that the impact of developing their product has on the world needs to also be considered and I appreciate actions and good design in efforts to reduce waste, pollution, and push towards more sustainable options.",Stitch,ESFP
312812,Marilaura,Lopez,marilaura.lopez@gmail.com,"1. An object that best represents who I am as a person.
I guess my hearing aids are the best representation of who I am. I have profound hearing loss and I have been wearing aids since I was sixteen. My hearing aids connect to me to the hearing world, they make work and social life possible. It's pretty funny because they are not beautiful objects. In fact they are a bit ugly, they are big, they are brown so they ""camouflage"" with my hair but I don't mind their ugliness. They are carefully crafted, they are super functional and they are precisely programmed to my hearing needs. I'm sure they are the most tailor made object in the world. I love them. 

2. An object that brings you joy in life.
Oh, I am a super big fan Topo Chico, a sparkling water that doesn't sell in Mexico City. It is only sold in northern Mexico and some states in the USA. It's so refreshing. It's super bubbly and crisp. Sometimes I order it online so I can have some at home. If I travel or my boyfriend does, we always bring some back home. I know it's something simple (and plain for some) but I guess scarcity and not having it all the time is what makes it taste so much better than any other sparkling water.

3. An item that shows what you are passionate about.
I really like the intersection between fashion and other disciplines: architecture, production design, photography, art. The last thing that I got obsessed with was Loewe using Karl Blossfeldt's naturalist photographs for its perfumes. I have never seem a simpler but more beautiful approach to botanics. I was so obsessed that I convinced a salesperson at a retailer in Mexico City to sell the Loewe counter posters to me. I love them! I choose my Hermès Kelly double tour bracelet and a Shinola passport cover with a W (friends called me Wa)

- I love my bracelet because it is timeless and classic and it goes with everything. It's versatile, you can wear it up or down. I have been wearing it everyday for maybe the last 4 years. It was a Christmas present from a very special person. 

- The passport cover is practical. When I travel I take all my documents and cards there. It's not beautiful but it is practical. These are my super beaten Acne Linden boots. I bought them about 4 or 5 years ago and I still love them. They have gone everywhere with me. They are confortable and versatile. I have changed the sole twice and painted them several times. I think they look old now but I think I wore them everyday for two years. 

The other one is a Mansur Gavriel bucket bag. I like that the interior is dusty pink, the size is right to carry my wallet, sunglasses, eyeglasses, keys and my hearing aid batteries. I think it is understated luxury, not so flashy. I like it. My engagement and wedding ring. They are Cartier. I am not married anymore so I might melt the rings and turn them into something cool with a bit of bling. Luxury upcyling!
I also love these Prada Derby shoes. They go with everything and are so timeless. The leather is so soft and buttery and they have this rubber Nike Vapor Max like sole that I really like. I hope they last decades. I guess the Hermès bracelet does all the work. It can be a ""status"" symbil but I see it more like a subtle statement that you value nice well crafted things. These are my minimum basics: wallet, hearing aid batteries, lipstick, keys, a pen and my asthma rescue inhaler. a. These are Chanel combat boots that my mom gave to me as a present in 2012.
b. We were on a vacation together in New York and saw them in Saks. I loved the subtle padding as well as the stitches. They are halfway between cuteness and roughness.
c. I loved that my mother gave them to me as a present. I will keep them forever, my first (and still the only) Chanel item.
d. I always think of my mom when I wear them. I really love them. 
e. hmmm maybe the sole could be a little thicker.  Besides that, they are absolutely perfect. In times of fast fashion and splurging it is difficult that you hold tightly to an item. I think brands should enable long lasting relationships between buyers and objects.

I'd love high end accessories to be long lasting and luxury brands to take good care of these goods. I'd love that I could take my leather boots to the retailer and have them cleaned and repaired there, to have my leather bracelet cleaned and moistured and the brass thingies polished. I would be willing to pay for these services if they ensure to make my purchases last longer. 

Also, it would be great to have a ""replacement"" service. Just like car industry does with leasings. For example, If I have been wearing the same bag for 2 or more years I can have the same model, color and size but new for a better price. It's a great way to skip seasonal items, surpass fast fashion giants and encourage people to buy timeless and more expensive pieces instead.",Stitch,
230601,Kamonnart,Ong,kamonn.art@gmail.com,"1. An object that best represents who I am as a person is my notebook/ gratitude journal because I write journal almost everyday to keep track of my mood, emotions, and ambition. Writing is therapy and it is one of the best way I use to reflect myself and reflect the world around me. I also find writing my gratitude daily is a really good way to start the day right. 
2. An object that brings me joy in life is my iPhone, because I can connect with my friends, local and abroad, through it. As a global citizen it is joyful that I have friends faraway and we can still connect even we could not in real life. 
3. An item that shows what I am passionate about is my Contax TVS II film camera. I love photography and use the camera to documents and remember moments that has passed. I also love storytelling and writing, so it is my companion for every memorable time I had enjoyed in life. 
(I didn't took a real photo of the actual object because some of them are not with me as I'm away from home this weekend) 1. Key chain holder, even if it's not leather. but the size and the shape of it is right and although many doors are now digital, my family home still has classic door locks which I like. Also It's easy for me to forget the keys, and as it's something we need to bring everywhere, I like that it's small, simple, and beautiful so I won't forget them and feel more precious and grateful that i have a home. 
2. Passport holder. I love travelling and passport is essential thing I've taken with me every trip, It is a mark of my journeys in life and everytime I put it in my bag, i feel joyful and adventurous. I like that these are small yet versatile because I can also put my cards and folded important docs inside, it fits well in my bag because I do not want to carry a big and chunky case around while travelling light.  I also like the case that can be personalised as it feels special. 1. My Lemaire's Egg Bag. It is my favourite handbag and it was also a gift to myself for my Master graduation. It's elegant, classic, timeless and also avant-garde and sophisticate with its shape and techniques. It's important that it's made out of leather with the technique the artisans use to hold the shape in hard shell. I've also seen the picture behind the process where there is a mold and a leather piece is fitted in place. They're simple shape and super clean, so the material needs to be special - and leather in different colors fit very well in these shapes. Not too much. not too little - just right. 
2.  Common projects high top sneakers, made out of white suede leather. I love their shoes because of the shapes - clean and lean. It makes my look complete and more interesting, even the white is not the whitest because it's suede - however I think with these shapes, either normal leather or suede fits well as it makes overall look more elegant and clean, not fussy or superficial like over-decorative street sneakers nor easy to be dirty like canvas ones. 1.  My Lemaire's Egg Bag : It's the same item that came to my mind with the last question because the bag is one of my most expensive purchase for a fashion accessory item. What makes it luxury is my personal connection to it as it's a present for myself in my Master's graduation and it's also a design from my most favourite designer in a decade, Christopher Lemaire and his girlfriend. For me, being able to afford the design mastery of a designer I admire who stays true to his independence, ideology and himself, not being bought or overrated by big luxury brands, is a true luxury. 
2. Pleats please jacket : I have chosen my pleats please beige jacket because it is my most precious purchase this year when I significantly reduce the amount of clothes I buy and increase the quality of what I choose to buy. This beige jacket is one of my instant dress item that Ican put on every look and it just makes me ready for meetings and events. What makes them luxury is the innovation and technique the brand and Issey Miyake always use with their materials and textiles, while balancing that with traditional inspiration yet avant-garde shapes. For me, Issey Miyake's legacy, design philosophy, and textile innovation is luxury. It also makes me look instantly elegant and classy! 1.I would say there is only one item in my mind that bring all three elements (small, leather, luxury) together - The Lemaire's Egg Bag ( I still consider it small compared to other handbags) 
2.If has to choose the other, I'd choose my Cutler & Gross sunglasses case/ Acne Leather purse - yet I didn't feel for it as luxury as maybe the connection between me and those objects started to fade away, or I didn't put much effort when buying those. 1. My IPhone - essential for communication, photography, documentation/note and navigation, also use digital banking as well 
2. A purse - we still use cash in Bangkok and this one carries my cards well. I love that it's hemp and was handwoven by artisans in North of Thailand
3. Bose  Noise-cancelling Earphone/ Sony  Noise-cancelling Headphone - Living in urban environment is a nightmare especially when there is a lot of noise pollution
4. Tangle Teezer - A good hair day is always a good day 
5. A mirror+powder pact& lipstick - red lips make me confident and bold
6. Pen / pencil + a small sketchbook (not in this picture) - ready for the ideas to be jotted down whenever
7. Keys (Not in this picture) - essential to get in my homes. 
8. Sunglasses (Not in this picture) - same as noise-cancelling headphone but for the eye - to cancel light pollution from adverts and neon light in the city of Bangkok a. My Lemaire Egg handbag
b. It caught my eye in their Paris atelier in Le Marais. I was super in love with the brand, the boutique, the feeling , everything. Just super elegant, clean and subtle. 
c. It is precious for me both because of the material and immaterial aspect of it. Regarding value, I spent most of my savings from part-time work on this bag. For values..It is precious for me to carry the symbol of my admired designer and creator of the brand, Christopher Lemaire, whom I respect in many aspects. 
d. It made me feel different in way that only people who knew the brand and is into fashion enough only knew where it's from because Lemaire is quite an indie brand, not mainstream yet and not available in Asia. It made me feel special, elegant, and tasteful - but not extravagant. It's subtle luxury and many people wanted to see it closely because they love the form and purity of its design.
e. I would change the functionality of the bag so that it can carry more or has a stronger closure. also when the finishing is too good - It's kind of heartbreaking to see scratches on its surface so I wish it's more durable regarding the scratch. I want you to keep in mind that people in my generation (I'm not sure about America but Europe is definitely) are starting to shift their values towards more immaterial ones: love, community, freedom, emotional connection, moments, learning, and experiences. Young adults want experiences that help them grow and be better as a person - which sometimes not reflect in their purchase of goods but towards experiences and learnings. Status today is less about showing off what bags you have, but what you have as a person. Goods help reflect, yet doesn't define who we are. Self-expression are not limited to what we wear anymore and I hope brands could help people express and transform in a better way. More diversity, self-love and acceptance as we are so bored with brands that try to profit from our self doubts. There is no social standards of beauty anymore. 

Another very important emerging value is sustainability and circularity. We are super conscious about what we buy, asking where it's made of, what and how it's made. We love transparency and want brands to be our hero - we don't want to support brands that abuse people, animals and the planet. In the era where the climate is broken, luxury is less about gaining more from resources but being in harmony with nature, making win-win situation for all. Only the organizations that care enough will earn our money, in the next decade.",Stitch,
334671,Emily,Bache,ebache3@gmail.com,"1. These spikey boots represent who I am in so many ways. For one, I love fashion. You'll never find me out of the house in sweatpants. I always have a look put together and I take pride in that. It's something that I'm known for. Specifically with these shoes, they are black leather and spikey. My aesthetic is very edgy and I think my lifestyle is edgy as well. I love rock n' roll, muscle cars, and have a fun on a whim type of life. These boots really show that I like this edgy style without me even having to say anything, it's great! 

2. I have played the harp since I was 5 years old and it brings me so much joy. I truly love music from classical to death metal (although I'm totally not into jazz and rap.) Otherwise, I like pretty much everything! Whenever I am overwhelmed or having a bad day just sitting at my harp for 30 minutes can really alter my state of mind. I love playing for myself and for other people. I listen to music constantly throughout the day and it really brings me so much happiness. 

3. I am so passionate about my blog. I have turned it into a career, but I would do it even if I didn't make any money off of it. This picture is of a magazine we were featured in based off of our blog work. We cover fashion, lifestyle and travel. All three things I have always been super passionate about. 1.
a. I took a photo of my white leather crocodile embossed passport holder. I bought this because I thought it elevated my travel gear. I like to look put together all the time and I thought having a passport without a fancy holder felt less than chic and almost messy. I felt so put together when I use my passport with the holder. The white leather croc embossed is also super unique and I always get compliments on them.

b. I also love that it is small because I can easily slip it into my purse or a pouch on a bag. 

2. 
a. My small nude leather wallet is a staple. I use it all the time. It is super thin so it fits in my purse well and I can fit all my other stuff in my purse (which is a lot I always feel like i'm Mary Poppins.) I was given this by a designer years ago and I think it is so well made. I will have this forever. 

b. I like that is small because I can have all of my credit cards, drivers license etc in there and it doesn't take up as much room as my previous wallets. They were always so thick. This leather wallet is so thin, which I feel is very rare to find in a leather wallet. Croc embossed leather tote bag: 

I LOVE this bag. I actually designed it myself with a company called Mon Purse, so it is exactly what I was looking for. It is super sturdy, a very thick leather. It is croc embossed to make it a bit more unique. I use this everyday to carry my computer and work items with me when I'm on the go (which I always am.) 

It is important that this was made out of leather because it is super sturdy and I need that to protect things like my laptop and camera. I have very delicate items that can't get broken in there and i like that it is so sturdy and stiff that it protects it. I also like that it will last for so long. Most tote bags that are canvas get ripped and break or get dirty. My black leather bag doesn't show dirt. 

Leather jacket: 

I live in this leather jacket. It is a staple piece in my closet. My go to look. It goes with so many of my outfits dresses, pants, skirts. I truly wear this more than any other jacket in my closet. I'd say at least 5 times/week.

It's super important that this item is made out of leather because a. the cool factor. b. it's warm. I have always lived in climates that are generally chilly (even in the Summer.) I grew up in Boston and then lived in NYC for 12 years. Sometimes I even wear a leather jacket under a coat to stay extra warm. I even wear my leather jacket in the Summer on cooler nights. I love that it is smooth, but thick enough to keep me warm and make me look extra cool haha. I choose these metallic Jimmy Choo stiletto heels. I bought them on a special occasion as a gift to myself. I love these heels and don't wear them often so that it is special when I do. I choose them because they were more expensive than I would normally spend on shoes and I don't wear them on a regular basis to keep them nice. 

They are luxury because they are well crafted and elite. Elite meaning that they cost a lot of money so only people who make a certain amount of money can afford them. They are designer pieces or couture usually. This is by a very well known designer who produces well made shoes that are expensive. 

I choose this Alexander McQueen scarf because it is one of my favorite pieces. I actually tied it to my purse to add a bit of luxury to my otherwise inexpensive purse. I do wear this more regularly, but it was an expensive designer piece that I bought. His dresses are thousands of dollars, so that is not something I can afford. But, even just a scarf of his is expensive, so I purchased this to at least say I owned a McQueen piece. Plus I love the design. 

It is luxury because it is definitely couture. Alexander McQueen is a well known high end designer. Not everyone can have an Alexander McQueen piece, so it makes it a luxury item. I got this Brahmin pony hair/leather wallet from the designer themselves. Brahmin is a brand who is well known and puts advertisements in high end fashion magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. It has black croc leather on the back and some on the front with pony hair details on the front. It is small about the size of a water bottle. This one is particularly more expensive than other wallets by them because of the pony hair and leather mix. I always have: 

My croc embossed Ralph Lauren leather wallet. That has all the actual important stuff! 
LAMB sunglasses 
Estée Lauder powder make up
NARS red lipstick pencil
Extra phone charge
Smith's Rosebud Salve 
Small hairspray 

I always always always have my wallet because of course it has my drivers license and credit cards etc. I am obsessed with my LAMB sunglasses. It's always smart to have sunglasses in case it gets too bright, but I always bring these ones because they have a bit of extra flare and I'm usually dressed in all black. The Estée Lauder powder is if my face gets oily or needs a touch up throughout the day. Red lipstick is always good to carry if you want to take a look from daytime to night time and you don't have time to go home and change. Smith's Rosebud salve is my favorite chapstick. It's smooth and always necessary especially in the winter months. Of course I always have an extra phone charge because i'm on my phone quite a bit for work and always run out. Finally, I always have a small can of hair spray because my hair looks better with volume haha. a. This is a bowl I bought while traveling in Morocco. 
b. I saw it in a small market place while in Tangier, Morocco. It was so beautiful I had to have it. They had so many like this, but I thought this was the most beautiful. The color was so pretty. There wasn't a lot of things that were that color green and it's my favorite color. 
c. It is so precious to me because it reminds me of traveling to Morocco. That was a big trip for me. I love traveling so much, but I am afraid to fly a bit. So, going there was the longest trip I've ever been on. It reminds me that I can do those things and see different places and I'll always have a piece of it with me. I display it on my bureau to show it off to others and myself everyday. 
d. I have it displayed in my house everyday, so I always have it with me! 
e. I wish that I had bought a set of them instead of just one. But I also love that this one is unique. Perhaps if it was bigger it would be better. There are a few things. I don’t think I could pick just one. It would be so incredible if they went the sustainable vegan route. I think that really speaks to my generation today. I just read about a guy who created leather out of a cactus. That would make me more apt to purchase it because I knew it wasn’t harming anything besides a cactus. Our generation is VERY conscious of the planet and animals. 

Also, don’t sacrifice fashion for function. So many companies try and go the route that is like look at how many things you can do with this. When in reality I would just buy the item that looks prettier. I just purchased a leather wallet from ASOS this past weekend solely based on the fact that I was searching for a black croc thin wallet. If you can have function and fashion, great! But, don’t sacrifice one for the other.",Stitch,
235023,Noah,Nguyen,graphics.noah@gmail.com,"1. An object that best represents who you are as a person: Pencil
Everything starts with a pencil sketch. With a pencil you can make as many mistake as you can. And unlike pens whose nibs are fixed, one can shape his or her own pencil with a knife. I choose a pencil to present myself because I'm not afraid of making mistakes and I always want to explore everything, from the foundation of a system or the art of creating.

2. An object that brings you joy in life: Perfume bottle
I'm very sensitive with scent and I'm very specific about the fragrance I use. I purchased this bottle of perfume at Le Labo, which was love at first sigh. The warm, sweet but spicy scent left on my clothes and skin calms me down, especially when I have a busy day. The bottle is small enough to be carried around and it has my name on it so I feel like the thing inside is not just perfume but a small world that only belongs to me. I also like it when people compliment on how nice the fragrance is.

3. An item that shows what you are passionate about: Book
I like reading. I enjoy not only the content that the book has to offer but the act of reading itself. I find it fascinating how books open a whole different dimension in front of those who immerse themselves in it. Open the book and I'm in a different world. The experience is so great that I want to to build a world for myself too. In other words, a lot of my inspiration for creating as an artist and designer comes from book and the experience that book offer its audience. a. Take a photo and tell us why you have chosen them. 
Those 2 are items that I always carry around with me: a small pot of vaseline and a lighter. 

b. Why do you like that these are small?
I don't use palm often so a small pot of vaseline is enough for me, also the size is very compact and I can carry it around with my without hassle. The lighter is another the small item that I always have with me, not just because I'm a smoker. I just like the feel of having a lighter this size in my pocket, not the bigger or heavier one but this one particular slim, light design; I have been buying the same kind of lighter for forever. a. Take a photo and tell us why you have chosen them. 
I choose my coin pocket and Dr Marten boots because I can't imagine those 2 being made from a different material

b. How important is it that these items are made out of leather. Why?
I don't usually own leather items. However when it comes to bag/pocket and shoes, leather is always my choice because they are usually water-proof (even if the item is not water-proof it would take longer for the water to get inside) and I like the sparkling look and a-class-of-its-own feel of it. a. Take a photo and tell us why you have chosen them. 
The Dr. Marten boots and Le Labo Eau de parfum are items that I don't mind spending tons of money because I know they are worth it

b. What makes them luxury?
The fact that they are from well-know brands and quite expensive is one factor, but what makes them luxury to me is that they add values to my life. Even to those who don't know brands that well, they can still tell that the boots go well with my fashion coordinate and they are well-made because of the good form/design, that the fragrance I use is totally different from those at the super market or shopping mall. I use leather cases for my fragrances when I carry them around, especially for those whose labels get damaged easily. Aside from the protection purpose, somehow I feel like keeping the bottle inside a leather case  makes the product more ""mine"", sometimes you can have your name engraved on the case too, brands like Jo Ma. People don't usually use a separated case for their fragrances, let alone a leather case, but I do; it is also a sign of how much I treasure the fragrance that I purchase. 1- 3CE Lipstick #116
Without a doubt, lipstick is a girl's best friend. I will never leave house without one. I always have this particular on with me because it goes well with my natural skin tone and brighten my face after applying.

3-Lighter
I always carry a lighter around, not only because I'm a smoker, but somehow I like the feel of having this one particular lighter design in my pocket, I always buy the same design. a. What is it?
The earring that I got from my grandmother 

b. Where and why did it catch your eye in the first place?
I got it when I had my ear pierced for the first time 

c. Why is it so precious to you?
It's a gift from my grandmother

d. Think back to the last time you had it with you... how did it make you feel?
I always wear this earrings. It's become some kind of charm that makes me feel calm when I wear it.

e. Imagine anything is possible, what would you change about it to make it even better?
I would prefer it without the sparkling stones, those stones make the earring look like child toy despite being made from real gold. As the economic and politic situation becomes more and more unstable, I think people are heading towards value-oriented products: instead of buying everything, they choose carefully and buy goods that provide value to their lifestyle. Without knowing the brand name, how do people know that your product is ""good for them""?",Stitch,
324040,Abi,Buller,bullerabi@gmail.com,"1. I feel like this object represents me as a person because of the colour, design, and scent. It feels feminine, stylish, and delicate and makes me feel good when I wear it.
2. This jacket brings me joy because of the colour, texture, and design. It makes me feel glamorous and is something I just particularly enjoy wearing.
3. Firstly, I've chosen my pearl ring because it's something I wear all the time  and feels special to me. It was given to me for my 18th birthday, so holds a lot of memories and particularly represents the vintage style I was going for at this stage of my life. I like that it's small and delicate – the same as a lot of my jewellery – because it adds detail and interest in a subtle way. 

I've also chosen my card holder because while it's not 'luxury' in terms of its monetary value, it's something I always carry with me, is incredibly useful, and is often commented on because of the colour fits in nicely with the rest of my clothes and accessories. I like that it's small because it fits into whatever bag I'm carrying and feels like a subtle and delicate accessory. I don't own many real leather items but the accessories shown in this image are all of the Anya Hindmarch products I own. I used to work for the brand so built a small collection of pieces. The handbag and blue purse are real leather and I particularly like them because they're classic, subtle, and have a vintage style which is actually quite different from a lot of Anya Hindmarch's other pieces. While a lot of the products I own are faux leather or other materials, these two that I have feel special because it makes them feel 'luxury' good quality, and I know they'll last a long time. 

This second image is also an Anya Hindmarch piece and something I love but feels much less important for it to be real leather, because it's appeal is more about the colour and design than the material it's made from. I do appreciate the clever design effect of the front weave though because it's been created without being sewn on glued together. If nothing else, this creates an interesting talking point and makes it feel like a unique product! This first image is of a secondhand embroidered dress which feels luxury to me because of its intricate detailing and overall design. It's something I bought for my graduation so feels particularly special to me and is an item I'll always keep even though I don't wear it very often. I think it's the association with it feeling 'special' that makes it feel luxury to me.

The below image is an Anya Hindmarch bag which is luxury but also an item that doesn't take itself too seriously. The colour and size means it goes with pretty much anything and is just a nice every day piece that feels both stylish and unique. Both of these items are 'small, leather and luxury' but in a way that feels specific to me. I have the association of them being the first designer accessories that I've owned as well as having a style that fits in with my taste preferences. They're both small enough to carry round easily and on an everyday basis but also feel luxury because of the material, design and pricepoint. As well as my phone (used to take the photo!), I always carry my card holder, a pen, a small fragrance and basic pieces of make up (concealer and lip products). The card holder is for obvious reasons - carrying cards for money and to be able to use public transport. While the make up and fragrance is to allow me to feel refreshed during the day. I always have a pen in case I need it at any point and a lot of the time have a notebook and book with me as well (though this depends on the size of my bag!). I usually carry a resuable water bottle too - but again, this really depends on which bag I have with me. The items I've photographed are the very basics, but this varies a lot depending on the context. a. A necklace with pearl and shell pendant
b. the interesting design and sparkle, especially the way it catches the light
c. it feels precious because it's something that goes well with everything I wear and feels important and special to me
d. I wear it almost every day...it's more a case of how odd I feel without it 
e. I would make it slightly better quality - although I love the design, I feel that it won't last for as long as I hope Definitely sustainability is a huge part of designing luxury - something that can be designed to last and is designed in a way that isn't harming the environment now or in the future. Also something that is ethically made - people are becoming much more aware of how their products are made and not settling for something that's been made in harmful conditions.",Stitch,
252371,christian,blanchet,cb@christianblanchet.com,"1. An object that best represents who you are as a person- GLASSES. I found these and loved how they looked on and found out that the brand ( SEE eye wear) only makes limited number so each style, which made me love them even more.
2. An object that brings you joy in life.- AIR PODS. I bring these every wear i go so that i can work or play hands free while listening to music and pod casts.
3. An item that shows what you are passionate about. - CAMERA. I love street photography and this Sony goes with me wherever i travel. 1. I own a single small leather wallet that i have had for over 5 years. I love it because its minimal and unbranded, but has held up for a longtime. It holds the exact number of cards i need, a little bit of cash, and my metro card. The size is perfect because it fits into my pocket without looking bulky.

2. I already used this in the previous activity, but the Apple Airpods ( and the case they come in) is the probably the smallest item i own and also my most frequently used item. 1.  Leather Jacket- This is my go to leather jacket for spring and fall. I dont think this would fit the same, smell the same, or wear in the same if it was made out of faux leather.
2. Leather sneakers- Also a go to piece for most casual occasions. Again, the real leather holds up longer and wears in better than faux leather would have. In my mind all of the items i have uploaded so far would fall towards the luxury goods category based on price. However, the below two items stood out first when i think of actual luxury.

1. YSL Boots- YSL is a designer brand and the price they charge for boots are for the luxury customer. I also find myself not wearing these as often as other items I own because i feel like i need to take better care of them and make sure they last as long as possible. 

2. Theory Cashmere sweater- Cashmere feels like a luxury item to me, no matter what brand is producing it.  This one in particular is extra soft and extra thick lending itself to feel even more luxurious. I dont actually think I own any true SMALL- LEATHER- LUXURY ( goods). If i had a nicer wallet ( my current wallet is leather but cost like $50) that would qualify. If my Air Pods had a nice leather case that would qualify, or if I had a leather watch band ( or a watch at all) that would qualify as well.  My Common Project sneakers might qualify as a small leather good? These are my go to items whether im traveling to work, on vacation, or just going to the store. They all feel like essential items that I need during any moment in time. My glasses would be my most precious items. I had been looking for a minimalist , round, type of eye glass and couldnt find one that loved and the ni stumbled upon these. They are precious to me because they are scarce ( only a few of this style were made), they are fragile, and because i use them every week. Last time i wore them they made me feel cool and relaxed. If i could change anything about them i would have like them to have come with a nicer case to carry them in ( something leather, sturdy, and timeless). The future of small leather goods need to meet the following criteria: 1. Personalization- This doesnt mean i want my initials monogrammed, it means i want to own something no one else does. 2. True Value- I want my small leather good to bring real value to my life ( like it protects me or my valuables in some way, or adds another dimension of wellness to my life). and 3. It should exist as a product line or brand that adds value to the world as a whole ( whether it gives back, is sustainable, or has a life time guarantee).",Stitch,
341333,Georgina,Diamond,diamond_georgina@hotmail.com,"My pictures contain: champagne, pictures and gym equipment. The champagne is an object that describe who I am, the pictures what brings joy to my life and gym equipment what brings passion to my life. My favourite: YSL, because it’s a pop of colour in my handbag, I like the texture of the fabric, unusual, not everyone has that colour way. Gucci, because it’s classic, big enough to fit my passport in but yet doesn’t look chunky, it’s timeless.

I like that these are small as they can go in many different handbags. Easy to use, don’t get in the way. I have chosen both of them for really the same reasons: quality, craftsmanship, durability, the look, the feel, the smell Celine handbag: classic, timeless, sophisticated, the brand, craftsmanship, quality. Givenchy boots: special, craftsmanship, quality, different, intricate details such as Givenchy on the buckle, on the heel, the brand, the studs. The fact that there aren’t loads everywhere. The experience of buying them. It’s small, it’s branded, understated, timeless, great quality, durable, the craftsmanship that’s gone into it. The details such as the stitching detail all the way through to the branding inside. Keys, cardholder, lipstick, lip salve, tissues, phone. This is what i can’t leave the house without and most are because of practical reasons. Keys, cardholder and phone I feel are easy to explain, pay for things, lock my front door, call anyone. Tissues are because I always feel they are always needed. Lip salve as my lips always feel dry. Lipstick just jazzes need up a little! A gold bracelet my Nan gave me. I didn’t purchase it. I was with my Nan and she was showing it to me and telling me the story about how my grandad bought it for her and she doesn’t wear it, did I want it. It’s so precious because it was given to me by my Nan. I always wear it, when I don’t wear it I feel lost and really upset. I would have a safety chain on it, In case it ever falls off. I still buy leather goods, I still eat meat, but our generation is really getting into sustainability, using animal friendly materials, items lasting longer. I think people buy into products because they love the brand, what the brand is for. That’s the first point to get them in, to get customers in. I love what a brand is about, who they are, then go and discover their collection. Small leather goods for me have to be eye catching, pretty, last for a couple of years without going out of fashion so to speak, show branding so people can see who they are. As mentioned the quality, the intricate details that others don’t have.",Stitch,
341332,Amandine ,Yuan,782458157@qq.com,"Hi, everyone. My name is Amandine, I am 27 years old and I work and live in Shanghai, China. I chose three photos that I thought would show some aspects of me. They are my earring shelf, Kindle and my gym photo. a. I chose these items because I use them frequently and I need to use them frequently in my daily life. 
b. My rings are not wide, this is because my hands are smaller, smaller rings will make my hands look very delicate. 
I like to buy perfume kits in small bottles at the airport, not only because I can experience different scents, but also because they are convenient to carry, for both work and travel. a. I chose the leather coat and the wallet because both items are black and have good texture. The leather feels comfortable and always makes people feel safe. Another reason that I also like these two items is they make me more confident. 
b. Jacket is made out of leather, so it's windproof and warm performance is very good, it looks like a thin piece of clothing but in cold weather it can withstand low temperature for me. The leather wallet makes me look more elegant when I pay or use my wallet, and the leather wallet can better protect my important items such as bank cards, credit cards and cash. a. I chose Prada handbags and my estee lauder skincare. The reason for choosing them is that most people's first impression of luxury is their price must be expensive. Indeed, Prada and estee lauder are both good brands. But for me, luxury has a different definition, which is how the owner use it. I had a good experience with both, and I was pretty sure what attracted me to them.
b. Prada bag is a gift from a family member a long time ago, when I received it, I just felt that this bag was very low-key, black looks very ordinary, but after using it, I found that it looks very small but it can contain a lot of items I need, and it is extraordinary light! It is luxury not only because of its price, but also because of the kindness my relatives give me and the convenience it brings to me in my daily life. 
I like Estee Lauder eye cream and essence very much, I call them luxury goods because it can help me retain time, time is very precious, everyone does not want to get old or look old, we use a variety of products and ways to maintain our young appearance, those products with better results are naturally luxury goods. 这是我的另外一个小包，首先它的尺寸很小，只是比我的钱包大一点。其实它是皮质的，摸起来很舒服。最后我很喜欢它的颜色和容纳性，这是一款很适合冬天的包包，太美了！This is my other small bag. First of all, it is small in size, just a little bigger than my wallet. Second, it's made of leather. That makes it's very comfortable to touch. Third, I really like its color and capacity, it is a very suitable for winter, so beautiful! That gives it element of luxury. They are my wallet, perfume in small bottle, cellphone, keys, tissues, wet wipes, lip cream, lip sticks, hand cream, small face cream, airpones, eye drops. These are kind of necessities of life, I need all of these to keep me feel confortable and safe when I leave my place. a. It is a ring.
b. It is a gift, it was lying in the ring box and the sapphire is very beautiful.
c. Because it is the first ring that my husband gave to me.
d. I worn it today, I'm getting use to wearing it on my finger now.
e. Since I chose the design of the ring, so no, I think everything is perfect with the ring, maybe just clean up and polish regularly. Meaning. I hope this product has at least one feature that can represent our generation or remind us of a story we can relate to. For example, a specific color or pattern has a special meaning (youth, first love, independence, self-confidence, etc.), which can be used to guide all this generation of consumers. I think the addition of famous designers can make it more effective in publicity. At the same time, the small leather goods must be both beautiful and practical, which is the main reason why products attract customers for a long time.",Stitch,
341335,Daniel,Caulfield-Sriklad,d.caulfieldsriklad@fashion.arts.ac.uk,"1. An object that best represents who you are as a person.
This question is extremely difficult to answer but I would say that my gold necklace is something could represent who I am. It is directly connected to my sense of spirituality. I've had the Buddha image since I was 16 and have worn it everyday since. When I turned 30 I gifted myself the gold chain and case for the Buddha image and wear it everyday.


2. An object that brings you joy in life.
This silk Thai scarf brings joy. I bought it on a trip 10 years ago and never used to wear it as it was very special. I recently started wearing it more frequently as I realised ""what is the point of having beautiful things that make you happy if you can't wear them more often""?


3. An item that shows what you are passionate about.
This ring is very special to me. It's a symbol of love and connection with my platonic life partner. However, it isn't an official legal marriage. It was exchanged during a wedding ceremony that had all the elements of a marriage - vows, speeches, celebrant, etc. It represents a passion I have to see and experience life in new ways, carving out new potentials in processes, people and connections. Small espresso cup: I bought this in a market in Thailand. I love it as it is irregular and has a slight gold lip to the cup and dish. I don't drink my coffee as an espresso so it becomes more of a luxury when I do use it.

The small ceramic jug is by an artist Yuta Segawa who makes tiny small ceramics. There is great craftsmanship and detail in this, even though it is so small. I love the scale of this as it feels more 'precious' due to its size. Dr Martens Bag: I love this bag as I've had it for 7 years and has travelled the world with me. The leather is very durable and I've had the straps reinforced only once during this time so I would that it is important that it made out of leather.

Dr Martens Shoes: These boots are very comfortable and I wear them most days (especially during this time of year 'Winter'). I take care of my leather shoes with wax to ensure they do not age badly. Many of the good quality leather goods I own still look brand new. Dried sage: what makes this a luxury is something I use when having time to myself either meditating or just enjoying my own space. It doesn't feel like a necessity when I am in this space which is why I've classed it as a luxury.

Malin + Goetz perfume oil: this product is a luxury as it doesn't feel like something I 'need'. I always treat myself to one of these oils as quality is really good and it's a brand that I enjoy having a relationship with e.g. in-store experience, trying different products. I don't feel I have one that perfectly sums up all three words but the closest I have is my wallet. I love the design, durability and function. The size is important due to its function. These are the absolute essentials: keys, wallet, phone (used to take the image) and a notebook and pen for taking notes. I will also often have a canvas tote bag that I keep in my jacket in case I purchase something while out. This is my gold necklace and image of luang phor ngern (a thai buddhist monk).

The buddhist image was given to me over ten years ago. I purchased the gold two years ago.

It's precious as it represents my spirituality and as as the gold was very expensive. 

I wear it everyday and if I ever do not wear it I feel less protected.

I would give it the power to always know where it is at all times (as I do fear that of losing it one day). Sustainability over what and how we purchase is key. I have stopped purchasing fashion that is not sustainable or does not have a commitment to sustainability.",Stitch,
341334,Melanie,Sweeney,Melasweeney@gmail.com,"1. An object that best represents who you are as a person  
-An item that I think best represents me as a person is probably my carry on suitcase! This suitcase doesn't go with me just for fancy vacations and trips, but it also comes along when I need to bring items that are hard to carry on public transportation all around with me. I decorate this suitcase with travel stickers from all of the places that I've been so far (or well, for all of the places that I've been so far and have been able to get a sticker of!) and also with stickers that represent my hobbies, so this suitcase is literally me! The small items that I chose to share are the following:

1. AirPods 
-the reason why I think these are small are because they’re, well, literally small. They’re easy to lose and easy to misplace! 

2. Lipstick 
-The reason why I think this item is small is because it fits in the palm of my hand and, like the AirPods, are also easy to lose and misplace! 1. The first item that I chose was my bag that I use for work and travel. The reason why I chose this one is because it’s the leather item I use the most. For me, it’s super important that I have this item made out of leather because leather improves as it ages, and I don’t want to have to purchase a new bag every year. When going to customer sites or for just going on vacation, it’s important to me to look good, and having a super dirty backpack all the time isn’t the best look. 

2. The second item I chose is my business card case. It’s not super important to me that it’s leather, but I’m looking for something that looks stylish and chic but lasts a long time since I don’t like changing my personal items very often. 1. My backpack. The reason why I consider it a luxury item is because of the high price tag and because of the craftsmanship that was used to produce it. It’s also made from Italian leather, and from what I hear that’s considered really high class! What makes this a luxury item is that it isn’t very readily available, and also the materials that were used to make the bag. 

2. My MacBook Pro. The reason why I consider this to be a luxury item is because i spent a lot more money than was necessary to be able to do something that a cheaper item (ie: using a windows computer to browse the web) to have. What I think makes this a luxury item is the innovation that was used to develop the systems and the style (okay sure it may not be like that at the time but when they were first released it was like that!) and also the high price tag. So! I think that I need two items? So I decided to share two that I have! 

1. Coach Hula Girl Key Holder 
-this is something that fits the category because it’s small (literally keys) leather, and luxury. Technically speaking, I can live without a leather key holder, but to have one anyways is my image of being luxurious. I actually received this as a gift from a friends sister — I actually wouldn’t buy something like this for myself! 

2. Leather Wallet 
-This wallet is the smallest one I’ve had while living in Japan — the other wallet I had before was one of those long thin ones! This one I consider luxurious because of the brand name attached to it. The reason why I bought it though is because it’s black and simple, so it should last a long time without having to worry about it getting dirty, like what happened with the one before. Also, since it’s leather, it’s considered more durable than the PVC leather wallets! Here are all the items in my bag! 
I take these with me because I feel as though they’re the things that I can’t go without in case of an emergency: 

Wallet — my wallet has my ID, train pass, credit cards, and health insurance information in it, so in case there’s a disaster then I’m all set to go with just my wallet. 

Folding umbrella — since I live in japan, we spend a lot of the day outside compared to America, so if it rains suddenly I need to be prepared. 

Keys — I need to get in and out of my house somehow! 

Pocket wifi and iPhone — I take these with me not just for gaming and entertainment purposes, but also in case there’s an emergency and I need to get in touch with my husband or family immediately. 

Chapstick — I hate chapped lips so I always make sure to have chapstick with me. If I forget to bring it one day, I have to go to the store and buy more My most precious item is the engagement ring that my husband gave me. 

Of course I'm not the one who picked it, but I'll tell you the reason why it caught his eye in the first place! 
Back when we were still in the dating phase, I mentioned to him that I wanted Tiffany's heart shaped diamond engagement ring and that I decided this waaaaay back in high school, but since it was super expensive it didn't have to be from Tiffany, it could be anything as long as it was cute! Him being the man he is decided that he would set out and get me the ring that I wanted (with a heart shaped diamond) and when he was consulting with some of the jewelers at the shop, they told him that if he chose a ring that had an irregular shaped diamond that it had basically no value. And well that's not good! So instead, he decided to have the ring itself set in a heart shape with a round diamond so that it would still retain the value. While he was shopping around, he found the one that he gave me and thought it was perfect, so he purchased it and gave it to me! 
The reason why it's so precious to me isn't just because it's my engagement ring, but it's at the time he didn't have a lot of money since he was still waiting for work to start, so he had to save up a lot of money to buy it for me. Of course I don't mind having a smaller and simpler ring (for me smaller and simpler is better, especially compared to the standard in the states right now!), but he wanted to get me something nice anyways, and that's why it's super precious to me. 

The last time I had it with me... well, I have it all the time! When I have it on it, it makes me feel really good because I know that other people might look at it and be like ""oh! She's engaged/married! That's so sweet!"" Also, it makes me feel good because every now and then I'll just glance at it and remember him and how he proposed twice (the first time he proposed he was technically unemployed so he didn't want to tell anyone but wanted to propose on my birthday anyways, and the second time he proposed it was when he started work and was able to shout to the world that we were engaged, lol) and I end up smiling like a dummy sometimes. 

The only thing that I think would make the ring better was if it was able to stay clean and perfect all the time. Besides that, it's already perfect the way that it is! The one thing that I'd want the brand to keep in mind when designing the future of small leather goods is sustainability. 
Recently with the environmental crisis, I feel like a lot of people are becoming more conscious in what items they're purchasing and how they're affecting the environment. I also know that there are a lot of people who don't want to buy leather because they're against using animals for the purpose of fashion, so if the brand could somehow find a source of leather that was sustainable and used 100% of the animal instead of just the skin, then it could be what really differentiates this brand from others. 

For me, if the brand openly advertised that they made their leather from the skin of animals that were raised for food (and from a sustainable farm that lets their animals roam free, nonetheless!) so there was no waste, I'd be more likely to buy more than I needed from that brand because I want to support their products and company as best as I can in hopes that other companies will catch on.",Stitch,
334672,Tammy ,Butterworth ,tammy.butterworthusa@icloud.com,"1. I chose fairy lights for this-I try to be a light in the world, a positive force. I love fairy lights and I know lots of people who take joy from them. I work hard in the space of bringing things to life through ideas and photography too- so I think they demonstrate that also. 

2. I chose my kitchen aid mixer. I love baking, either for friends, or my two boys- we love to spend time baking and bringing joy through tasty food. Kitchen aid makes this so easy and it looks amazing in the kitchen too! We managed to get a red one with lots of matching accessories too- so everything fits and it brings me joy. 

3. I am passionate about my friends and family- that is what we are here in this world and living these lives for. We try to have more experiences than possessions, and this represents how much they mean to me. I love that my AirPods are so small- they can fit right into my pocket, and its great that the case carries its own power and can charge them up in between uses too- and its all so small and well designed. 

I also like my rollerball perfume, to complement my full sized version. The roller ball version fits into my purse, and I can also easily take it on the road when travelkling through airports- it means I can have the things I want with me, but without the hassle. I have a great pair of leather gloves- I originally bought them because of the color- they are a beautiful blue- and that really cheers me up when the weather is cold and grey- so many people wear black, blue pops and makes me smile. The fact that they are leather is a bonus, though they are so soft and comfortable- I love to wear them. If they were not leather- but as beautiful, and still as comfortable- that would be ok. 

I also have a beautiful pair of leather shoes- I love love love good shoes, and know that they are worth investing in. The right pair of shoes can out you in the right mood for the whole day! (And get a lot of complements!). I do prefer leather when it comes to shoes, they fit better and last longer too if they are looked after. I love my Sophie Alexander jewelry from when my son was born- it is a beautiful pendant that is very special to me. It’s a small indulgence that brings me great joy- especially when I am away from my family- it helps me to feel rooted and connected. The luxury is in that it was a one off purchase, I don’t need more than this, and it was therefore worth paying a little more for than I would usually spend. 

I have a beautiful Swarovski brooch- I was happy to treat myself to this after a promotion at work, so it reminds me of a great achievement. Also, as it is a brooch, I can wear it in different ways and with different outfits- so it can remain current and updated- rather than something which may be of its time. It’s luxury because again, it was an investment, but it is very special to me. I like this small shoulder bag from Furla- its smaller than most, I love the super cute design (it’s very me)- and is has some really nice features like the clasp and a lovely little pocket feature inside- these things make it feel more luxurious. I will always have: 
- iPhone
- lip balm
- keys

I actually try to travel without a bag if I can, and will put things into my pockets. I got a newer Apple Watch so I could even go out without my phone if I needed to, and I look for places that take Apple Pay, so I can travel without cards and cash too. Phones can do so much these days, I rarely need anything else with me. The most precious thing I have is photos and memories of my boys when they were babies- I have these printed out, and stored digitally on the cloud. 
I am a photographer, so am always looking for good ways to capture our experiences together- and these are things I cannot go back and get again, they are moments, connections- they happened, and the photos are a real and lasting memory. As I get older and start to forget things- these photos will bring those emotions come rushing back, where they may otherwise not. 
Every time I go through these pictures I am filled with warmth and joy- I share them with the boys now too and they make them smile and snuggle up to look at them too. 
I would make these even better by having them out on display more often, more ways to look at them, see them, share them. I would want them to consider sustainability- keeping the planet going- the product should be one which brings joy, but can continue to do so for many years to come- so that it doesn’t go out of fashion and stop being used. We are working with a finite set of resources! I would consider too- in this world where we see more plant based foods (impossible and beyond)- does real leather need to have the prestige it has- is there an impossible version of small luxury goods too?",Stitch,
341331,CJ,Feng,cjfong@outlook.com,"1. I would describe myself as a curious and creative person. i like to explore, to discover new things and open to different cultures and possibilities. so the art work ""self-protrait"" i made when i was in uni can represent who i am as a person, it's about breaking old rules and building up new order.
2. It doesnt sound very exciting but i would say my phone lol,  i get information and idea from it and it also shape my social life.
3. I'm passionate about fashion and music, and i almost wear black every day and for all occasions, so a black t shirt can easily represent these two aspects with its minimalist design and it's ability to dress up or down no matter when im going to work or going to an underground techno club. 1. this balenciaga wallet would definatly be my no1 favourite small leather good, i used to have the long balenciaga papier wallet (unfortunatly it's stolen), but it's really big and can bearly fit into my bag (i have a small body and ive been using balenciaga papier mini size), so after it's stolen i got this one. it's really lightweight, and i love these lambskin texture, i would have brought a plain black one but they didnt have it in this material so i got the graffiti one. it's has proper size and there's a pocket outside which makes it very convient for coins and keys, and inside there are 3 card slots inside that can fit 6 cards, and one bill compartment. really easy and convient for daily usage. i llike smaller wallet because you can fit it in different size of bags and easy to hold it if you're not taking any bag. (the attached photo shows how small it is)
2. acne studios card holder. it's a cost-effective piece, very slim and you can put it in your jeans pockets.
3. i know you're asking for two but i really like this maison martin margiela small bag as well, just really good for styling and it's one of my favourite bags. 1. my all time favourite balenciaga papier bag, it was my dream bag and i got it in my first year of uni, been using it almost every day until now. it's really light and you can almost match it with any thing any style. although it's small, it has a big space inside, it has wonderful texture, shinny metal and and i really like the side zipper decoration too.
It's quite important that bags are made of leather becasue i think bag should be durable since it has a high frequency to use, and be timeless since i wont buy bags all the time, so i would choose classic material like leather instead of other material. 
2. hulmut lang patent leather pants. its high waist and straight leg leather fits my body and its super chic for winter, really easy to match sweater and jacket. i think leather pants is a must-have and these ones with interesting material and perfect shape can really stand out. Pants are not necessarily made of leather, i think it's more out of a need that you dont want to look bulky in winter but you need to keep warm so you wear leather pants. But i do think leather pants make your legs look slimmer and straight. 1. maison margiela limited edition derby, i love it becuse i like the ideas of broken mirror and turn it into a unique design. it's luxury becuse it's limited and handmade unique material.
2. balenciaga papier bag. it's the first luxury stuff i bought and i think it's pretty important to me, plus i use it all the time. it's luxury because it's expensive, and of good design and quality. i dont have a correct answer becuase i dont think i have an items matches these three elements. but if i have to choose a closest one i would say the balenciaga wallet. headphones, perfume, wallet, lipsticks and lip balm.  lipstick and lip balm are the only makeup i use, i have take them with me cuz lipsticks are easily removed after eating haha. i love perfume so ill usually take the perfume oil or sampler, the scent makes me feel secure. i'd die without my headphones cuz i need music on my way especially on public transportation. wallet for money and all the cards and keys. It's a pendant from my mom for my 18th birthday. 
A week before my 18th birthday we walked pass a jewelry shop together saw it on the window, it's simple but the cutting and the diamond pieces makes it look special. i tried it on and it fits me very well.
It's precious to me because it's my 18 birthday gift from my mom and it has a special meaning of representing me became an adult. 
I've been wearing it all the time actually, i dont really take it off, it makes me feel the connection between me and my mom and always remind me of her best wishes to me of becoming a better person.
If I could change, maybe change a tighter catch because it sometimes unfastened itself from my neck and i would have lost it. most importantly it has to be in good quality, no matter it's handmade or not, it might become mass production in the end, but that doesnt change the fact that people want good quality products when they pay a lot of money.

be authentic, and attach meaningful ideas in the products like creating an artwork, it's more important to see the brand's personalities than seeing a bunch of influencers wearing the same stuff.",Stitch,
341330,Muchen,Li,morna.lee10@gmail.com,"1.  Perfume can best represent who I am. Every person is very unique, like each perfume, after chemical reaction with an individual will give off its unique representative scent.
2.  ""Churros con chocolate"" is the object that brings me joy in life, no matter in rainy day or sunny weather, no matter in early daytime, or late midnight, churros in the street corner can always be my prior option to taste the sweetness from daily busy. 
3. ""Globe"" would show my passion for this world and science. I love traveling in spare time, but I also like to watch earth globe since I was at an early age, the touching moment between fingertip to the spot on the globe, which would make me feel like I'm right on the journey to the place. Also, as a part of the solar system, earth- the marvelous blue marble can always remind me of the relationship between earth and cosmos, the reliance between life and nature. 1. I chose this "" sun& moon"" earring because ""sun"" is a symbol of beginnings, it comes with bright and heat, however, ""new moon"" is a symbol of a new beginning, it's like a powerful sword tears apart dark sky and brings light back to the earth after a long time waiting, it represents glamour and elegance. Like ""yin"" and ""yang"", ""sun"" and ""moon they are contrary but harmonious, the end isn't an ending but a new round beginning.  This earring is small in size but infinite in a symbol like a universe, "" small"" sometimes can be modest.  

2. For the necklace, it has a beautiful name called "" sparkling"", which says each person can only have one time ""flipped"" in her/his life, which represents simplicity and innocence in such a complicated world. This necklace can always remind me of pure love. Keep innocence, keep love. Love can be small, but can also be your a powerful armor. I chose the bag and shoe because of its design and their texture. I prefer leather-made bags and shoes. As a material, leather is very durable, and its texture is very soft and warm to the skin, which is different from plastic or metal.  Leather products can offer their users an enjoyable experience. Especially for the shoes, leather skin can breathe, which brings my feet comfortable and relax. LV is a very classic and representative luxury brand famous for its bag products, so it is always the first choice for beginning bag buyers. As a luxury brand, it also represents superior quality and worthy investment value. And Hermes is my favorite perfume brand, these two perfumes' scents can most represent my personality and they can also bring me pleasure and sweetness.
What makes these products luxury, not just because of its price but also it's excellence, brand value, product quality, and unique story behind it. The small purse could be a good representative of ""small"" in size,  "" leather"" in material and from the luxury brand 'Louis Vuitton'.  This purse is suitable for both cash and cards, it's highlight should be the round-shaped""dot"",  simple but with various colors as your choice, so it is also very popular among young girls. For me, the pink dot is very energetic and sweet, with a strong female character, and the whole-body pattern is from its own products logo. My must-have items in the handbag or even pocket should be several simple make-up products: red lipstick, eyelash curler, and blush.
I always bring two to three different colored red lipsticks with me, light or pinkish color for daytime,  or I would mix two different red together, and rogue is for the evening, red lipstick can always be girls' best weapon. Eyelash curler can give eyes an awake look, blush would add cheek or even eyelids a beautiful color, like rosy, orange... changing by the mood. My most precious item rightly should be my  ""portable electric kettle"", I got it from south Korean at the moment I was planning to go skiing in Europe. As a fan of technology products, and morning tea person, this "" portable kettle"" is great for me. I was deeply attracted by its technology, according to its introduction, even in Tibet, the water can reach boiling temperature, and it's super light, even with a touchable LED screen can set the desired temperature and even keep at a certain temperature as you like. Also, it has a nice look.
As I live and travel a lot in Europe, here is not a place for warm drinking water. But with this portable kettle, it does make my winter and traveling easier whenever or wherever I go. But if I can do any change on it, I hope can keep the water at a certain temperature without cable, because it's not safe to put kettle aside without attention. I hope the small leather goods, is portable enough, small but with reasonable storing space. As now our generation young people prefer to put everything together in a small but durable, fashion container, like ""bag"". Also, hope the bag is easy to clean up because I don't want my mascara or hand cream to stay in the bag all the time but can't be washed. And after knowing about the processing of leather products, I wish the material can be eco-friendly because nowadays we shouldn't just care about us, but the earth environment.",Stitch,ENFJ
325503,Johannes,Heilberger,JohannesHeilberger@gmx.de,"Disclaimer: I had to use pictures from the Internet, as I am on a trip around the world and left these objects in a casket with my mother, as the places I go to are too dangerous.

1. I got this watch from my parents for my A-Levels. Normally it follows me everywhere, and shares all the memories that I am experiencing, good or bad. The wristband has a lot of patina, which makes it very personal for me. It reminds me to watch myself and be reflected. It always keeps on running, no matter what - absolutely reliable. When I look at it, I am remembered that sometimes I lose track of time, and thats a wonderful thing. It also reflects my personality, as this is a very classical watch, that first looks sleek, neat and straight, but can be worn in any situation without ever attract attention in a negative way. It also reminds me of staying grounded and always have my loved ones around me.

2. The Trinity Bracelet by Cartier was given to me by some of my best friends. They all have the same bracelet but in different colors - it stands for love, fidelity and friendship. It reminds me of the strong bond I have with my friends, and loved ones in general, and how everyone plays a very different role in my life, but they all inspire me and made me the person I am at the end of the day. The three rings also remind me of my 2 siblings, and how different we are, but that we stay intertwined forever.

3. The Bose headphones stand for my love and passion for music. Music has opened so many pathways in my life and is a big reason for me being who I am. I met many of my friends through nightlife and DJing, learnt to be completely independent with the money I earned, and also love for myself through confidence and exploring my body when dancing 1. The Palm Angels Keychain Wallet: I love wallets in general, and the extra pocket on the front is extremely handy (same as with the Rimowa Bolero suitcase). The quality is superb and the keychain lets me wear it also without having pockets in my pants, as well as very safe at a belt

2. Margiela has absolutely genius accessories, and I love my Margiela USB. I use it for DJing, but also work, and as a toned-down fashion statement in general According to a study of HTC, well-designed objects that are both beautiful and functional trigger positive emotions like calmness and contentment, reducing negative feelings like anger and annoyance by almost a third.

1. One of the most functional, beautiful, but also most meaningful leather objects to me is my passport holder. It contains a lot of memory. The patina it has by now, makes it unique. Therefore it is important that its made out of leather. My passport holder also has my initials stamped on it.
2. Common projects are my favorite shoes, as they are timeless and can be worn to literally any outfit. They are durable, and I can not imagine them not being made of leather Luxury to me is outstanding craftsmanship & design, and a scarce product with a story. It can be anything, regardless of the price

1. My Rolex Milgauss - a statement piece which I bought for myself only. It gives me confidence and also allows you to be taken serious by people that judge you on first sight.
2. My Versace Fluo suit - gives me freedom and confidence, makes me move freely and impress other people by showing confidence in wearing such a statement piece. The craftsmanship and the material quality are outstanding Two images for each word? 

My passport holder combines all of these attributes. Its small and easily to stow away. The zip off feature comes in extremely handy. The leather is calf and super high quality. Look, feeling, and availability of the product all qualify it as luxury for me. It was sold out very fast so I had to find it on eBay. 
Its a complete evergreen for me and the stamped initials make it even more personal. '- Laptop (to work) & charger
- Pen & Notebook (to write down thoughts & sketch)
- Perfume (essential for me)
- Incent (mostly palo santo - as a 
- My Diapason (tuning fork which I mostly wear as a necklace)
- Headphones (for music & podcasts) + many times my Native Instruments Audio 6 soundcard (for producing music)
- Passport & Holder (especially when I travel)
- hygiene kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, nail file)
- Mint or chewing gum
- Sleeping Mask
- A book that I am reading at the moment
- Small Neck Pillow which unfolds into a hammock (on travels)

These are my essentials for any weekends trips etc to be independent from the place that I am staying in. I prefer a backpack thats foldable and has various easy-to-access pockets and zips. The backpack should be all-weather. I prefer a backpack, but also use my Rimowa Bolero.' a. My Rolex Milgauss
b. I did a lot of research on watches and went through many stores. In the end I found a vintage version on Hodinkee and fell in love
c. I was looking for a watch to complete my selection of watches I got from my parents for my A-levels, bachelor & master. It should be the first watch I bought with money that I earned alone. However this was only possible because of the exceptional position my parents put me in, and the amount of support they provided. Therefore the watch for me represents the joint effort of my parents and myself
d. empowered, confident, giving a successful image to a stranger, but also able to provide a story with it when asked
e. In my eyes a watch is meant to be given to the next generation, continuing the story it was writing for the first owner. I would love to be able to give it my own personalisation, either with engraving, but also changing single components of the watch to make it different from all the other ones Quality has become a given characteristic - however more and more brands seem to move away from this decisive pillar. Quality complaints are increasing. Instead of focusing on a customer-centric, data driven approach, luxury brands should take on their role of innovators and pioneers again. They should inspire customers, and not only be inspired by them, with huge merchandising teams trying to analyze what worked best in the past collections, replicating that. 

True luxury is bold, sophisticated and different - and it has to be polarizing in my opinion (see the success of Michele at Gucci, and the initial resistance they were facing). It is timeless, follows a clear vision across the complete brand and is striving for penultimate quality.

""Throughout the entire history of humankind every timeless creation is driven by the energy, inspiration and vision of the passionate craftsman. Behind every magnum opus lays a higher purpose. By its very definition, the outcome is hard to replicate, let alone scale."" - this seems not to be true for most luxury brands anymore, as they are falling for the hype and give up their clear brand identity for a new and cool logo, not really communicating a clear vision.

Luxury products are for a very select group of true-believers. When brands stop trying to communicate with everyone, and trying to sell as many of their products as possible, they can focus on a scarcity in an ecosystem of a culture of excellence again.",Stitch,ENFP
230591,Kate,Monro,katemonroe@yahoo.com,"TRAINERS: I tried not to overthink this! But these are my trainers. 
I never purchased multiple pairs of the same thing until I met these. 
Its partly practical. I have RSI in my left foot and struggle to find footwear that 'works'. It was the bane of my life at first but lately I've come to appreciate the simplicity of having one pair of shoes that work with everything I own. I have five pairs.
I wear them with dresses a lot, jeans obviously, skirts, shorts, whatever.
I love the orange band at the back. In fact, there isn't a single other item of clothing I've owned that strangers have stopped me in shops and on the street to ask me about more than these trainers.
I need to be able to move through the world easily. I love the way they add a sporty edge to a very feminine look. I will always be a tomboy at heart. These trainers are always a visual reminder of that. I can't be arsed anymore with teetering around on heels. They are such a waste of time. I love them but life is too short.
Long live trainers.

WALLET: I think I come from a generation (Gen X) who feel a slight sense of embarrasment at loving material things too much. Our parents lived through the war and spent our childhood reminding us of the things they didn't have and to be thankful for what we do have - an attitude I appreciate......HOWEVER, I do love small luxuries. 

I have no need for tons of shit (stuff) but I like to spend money from time to time on something lovely. This wallet is a thing of beauty. Its so pretty to look at. Weirdly its not a colour I'd ever felt drawn to but I adore it. I like the vintage quality of the colour and design. It looks like it was made with purpose by someone who knew what they were doing. 

Its also serves a purpose as it holds my money and cards. If Im being honest, its not that practical as it doesn't fit in a cross body bag but I don't care. When I saw it, I spent exactly no seconds deciding to buy it. Sometimes you have to throw caution to the winds.

SUITCASE: Again, there are a million other things I could have posted but I tried not to overthink it. This is my suitcase. I try to only travel with carry on.
I live to travel and I live to travel light.
Full disclosure, that means I spend a lot of time deciding what I will put in it but for me, that's a really nice way to quietly wind myself up about how excited I am to be travelling again! How I dress and present myself to the world is quite fundamental to my happiness and to my identity if I'm honest - so I'm always looking for ways to make sure I have everything I need, but not to be weighed down.
I have come to really really love solo travel in the last 5/10 years and it is one of the greatest joys of my life. The first image is of a Max doll from Where the Wild Things Are. 
Its a book I had as a kid and he sits on the book shelf to remind me.
I was obsessed with Max. Maurice Sendak (the author) connects so well with the idea that no one really takes you seriously as a child - so Max takes off on some adventures of his own (in his 'wild' suit, because he's so unruly) to a wild country, across land and sea to hang with some actual wild things.
In the end, the adventures he goes on are possibly in his imagination - or are they?! - but there are various parts of the book where his bedroom is half room and half forest, that liminal space in between the 'real' and the 'imagined'. This is a rich world for me, for children generally, and for any person with an imagination, where the lines between reality and fantasy are always blurred and you're not sure what is real when you 'wake up' and what is not. How many times have you said as an adult 'remember that time we....' and then tailed off as you realise it was possibly something you dreamt as a child and didn't actually happen!
Max is small and cute. He can be tucked onto a shelf easily.

When we talk about 'small leather goods', I understand that as probably luxury items. Items of craftsmanship. Wallets, card holders, maybe diaries, an ipad mini sleeve, possibly belts although I find them less interesting. To me, we are talking about things that 'hold' or contain other things that we carry around with us of a day, like a wallet, for your cards and money.
Craftsman/woman ship is a key word.
Its the connection to something that has been handled by another person, crafted, created, made, we imagine, with love and care.
In an age where so many things feel uncertain, for better or worse, politically, spiritually, in terms of technology - the challenges and excitement of AI and how our worlds may look in 5, 10, 20 years, holding onto something that a person has actually made is a tangible feeling of security, small as it may be.
The item may be small, the way it makes us feel is not.
Its a connection to an era where people put work into making things - as they will continue to, (but we fear they might not!)
And also, of course, small leather goods are items of beauty. You cannot underestimate the value of beauty. As with art. It adds tangible value to our lives, as much as we might not like to admit it. It brings us joy and pleasure. Joy and pleasure are not nothing.

I added a small book, 'Writing down the Bones'. Its well worn, as you can see. Its a book about writing that I refer to often.
It fits in a bag. I wouldn't want to read it on my phone. I like to scribble in the (very small!) margins.
I like the idea of literally pulling a book out of my pocket.

I have sometimes asked myself, why do we love small things, as adults? Those packets of small kellogs cereal boxes, smaller versions of beauty products to travel with...
Its practicality in many cases. Needing things that don't up space. Simple life hacks.
The tiny cereal packets remind us of childhood!
I write and photograph a blog about men that have small dogs. This was a revolutionary concept when I began it 7 or 8 years ago. Masculinity has evolved a lot in that time and its less surprising now but when I have asked men why they have a small dog, they often start with 'he's more portable', 'he's easy to get in the car or in a carry bag' etc etc
But pressed/encouraged, my take away is that men - like the rest of the human race - are as nurturing as the next person.
And I think thats why we like small things. Its an innate human urge, to protect, to nurture, to care for. Small things make us feel like that as human beings. They bring out our natural protective tendencies.

I included a final picture of a very lovely Smythson leather travel wallet. In truth, I don't travel with it often as I'm always trying to get the weight of my luggage down.
But it has become a container, literally, for all things associated with travel and items of memorabilia I have picked up on the way and can't let go of. Tickets, leaflets, things that tie me to my travels, that I like to look at and handle when Im not travelling.
The wallet perhaps ties me to an era when travel WAS more of a luxury past time for most people. You did not travel for fun a hundred years ago unless you had money and because you had money, you also had fancy luggage.
Fancy luggage is impractical for most people who can hop on easy jet or whatever and travel the globe with relative ease in this era of globalisation
But the small fancy wallet is an affordable luxury that ties me to a bygone era.
And its just really pretty. The first is a bag I was given for my birthday from & Other Stories. I chose it because I've used it every day since I was given it 18 months ago. 
It works super hard for me. Its cute and the chain strap adds zip to my usual tomboy look. Its also got 3 pockets so lots of places to stash travel memorabilia collected in my daily life! The second is a skirt I bought by accident at a vintage fair. I went to buy a gift for someone and came back with a Temperley skirt for myself. I fell in love with the detail around the waist. Its unique and I've never regretted it.

The skirt would not have been the skirt unless it were leather. Thats what makes it special. Its sexy and its practical at the same time. 
I like the way the leather moulds to my skin and my shape even though it belonged to another woman before it belonged to me. It now looks me-shaped.  Leather can be dressed up or down. Predictably I only ever wear it with trainers or flip flops and I love that. The two inverted v shapes are pockets btw. That just makes it even more special. 

For the bag its slightly less important that its made of leather. If it were canvas it would still be a great bag, but I do love the fact that it IS made of leather.
I like the marbled textured effect of this leather. 
And again, leather changes over time. It moves and moulds according to how you as an individual use it.
So it becomes a very personal item.
Leather tells a story. The two things I immediately think of are a beautiful Prada bag and Big Daddy Coat (!!)

I have posted two pictures of the coat, one of me in it, and the other of my friends son because he looks so great in it. The coat is a source of fascination and also a really tactile experience for people. It's not an expensive coat. Its high street but it's a total love affair. I feel encased in it, safe, enclosed in a puff of huge (fake of course) brown fur. Its OTT.  It is luxury fluffy protection for a winter in The Smoke or overseas. The luxury is 100% in its tactile and voluminous nature. Were it real fur it would be totally ostentatious (not to mention cruel and innappropriate) but once again, as to my point about luxury luggage, even though its not an expensive item, it still points to an era when people did wear fur to communicate something to people around them. There is something about walking around in something that is essentially a cross between still being in bed and wearing a giant bear that says luxury. Even if it came from Mango. I feel excited when I know I'm going to put this coat on.

The second is a really lovely nylon Prada bag. Its technically menswear but I love the cute car print and its versatile nature and always strayed into menswear anyway (via trainers and jeans).
I have to stop myself using this bag every single day as I don't want to wear it out and its vintage so I doubt I'll ever have the same bag again. 
By nature, I need a high/low mix of things to wear. Even if I were minted, I find the idea of labels head to toe un-imaginative and limited. I like to pick and choose and curate what I wear from many sources. 
Full disclosure: I'd love this bag even if it weren't Prada, but the label does give it an extra luxurious gloss, I can't deny that. The label thrills me a little. I'm quite scruffy by nature so for me, its luxurious quality adds shine to my tom boy-ish look.

I think, if I dig deeper, I have found liberation in occasionally splashing out for myself and buying more luxury items. Its partly about acknowledging that life is happening right now. Not at some mystical point in the future when everything will be 'sorted out' or 'organized' and I will have 'arrived' at my perfect life. My imperfect life is happening right now and its great. So buy the bag, enjoy the bag, show off the bag. Do what you like. Its not about spunking your life savings and leaving yourself short. This bag is about me allowing myself more luxury and even more than that, enjoying it a lot. I'm back to the vintage green leather Mui Mui.
For me, this item brings all three elements together: small, leather and luxury.
Buying it felt like an extravagance because I already have another one (smaller) that I use all the time so this one is surplus to requirements, which makes it luxury. 

I mean, how many wallets does a person need (I probably have 6 or 7 for reference) but this one isn't hugely practical as it doesn't fit in a cross body bag so it doesn't come out that often.

It makes me feel special and I'm trying to articulate why. I think its luxury because it doesn't serve a completely practical purpose. 
Its luxury because its made of leather, because of its beautiful pattern and patina. It also has a lovely silk lining.
Someone spent time making this. Working with leather is a very specific thing. You have to know what you're doing when you put a needle through a beautiful piece of leather. There are no room for mistakes once the needle goes in!!!
This wasn't flippantly made. It must have been created with love, by a person. Two phones, one personal, one from work. The work phone stays home at the weekend but the other phone comes everywhere. Occasionally I might go to the shops without it but then I panic about not having a camera on me.
Gloves and bike light lights for winter riding. I need these in the winter.
Painkillers, bee energy tablets and tampons for tiring painful times of the month!
85% chocolate: the perfect balance between pleasure and health. It helps pep me up as I don't drink caffeine. It also stops me eating too much sugary shit.
Articles torn out of newspapers when I'm on the tube, a Greek bus timetable I can't face taking out of my bag as it reminds me of summer adventures
A diary. I didn't include this as a small leather luxury item although I could have. But I consider it a necessity. I do have an online diary but I need to look, visually at my entire week on paper to plan it properly and make sure I'm not putting too much stuff in/think about how best to use my time.
Camera: that doesn't make it in every single day, but most days. Its my passion and my love. I feel better and more secure when it's there. I need it to document things and photograph people. I don't think its fair to ask strangers if you can take their photo and then do it on a phone camera. You need to look like you take what you're doing seriously.
Lip balm, keys, hair grips, lipstick just in case I end up somewhere fancy. 
Polo mints remind me of my mum.
Pencil, Dr Stuarts Tranquility tea - my daily addiction.
My wallet for cards and money although I rarely have cash on me
Hairbrush, just because. My concession to trying to look groomed along with the emergency lip colour I am struggling with this question because I think I am in transition with evaluating exactly what a 'most precious' item is. 
Is it really just an item, an inanimate object? If you'd asked me this 5 years ago, I might have said my paternal grandmother's diamond ring that I've worn for 25 years but I question that now. I'd be gutted if someone stole it from me. But I'm in a phase where perhaps life is really illustrating to me - as a person who has an appreciation for material things - that they are not the be all and end all. 
The most precious things are the ones that are making my heart ache. 
This little red vintage scarf that my mum wore knotted around her neck.
My beautiful cat Edward (no longer with us)....but he illustrates something quite fundamental, I feel, about how I evaluate preciousness because at times, I've felt guilty about how obsessed I was with how he looks! As if beauty is everything! It's not. I know that. But he was an incredibly beautiful creature to look at. A walking work of art, and a very charismatic, lovable cat. I sprung him from the local shelter and felt a huge sense of responsibility towards his welfare and happiness. He was very precious. As was my mum! I miss and celebrate them both.
But for a more conventional answer, I have alighted on my gold bracelet. I look at it and cannot believe that I actually wore it on the beach at some points of my life - eeek. I would be SO sad if something happened to this item of great beauty. 
It was given to me by my mums best friend when I was christened (we aren't religious but I think we went through the ceremony of christening for my paternal grandmother who was). 
My family lived in Beirut in Lebanon for a long time before I was born. My three brothers and sisters were raised and went to school there. Its a whole episode of my life (even though I wasn't born) that holds sentimental value for me, I think because it holds sentimental value for my family.
Wrapped up in this one object is all of that. A big story, that is too big to tell here in this space!
They loved their life in Beirut. The bracelet has charms. The national tree of Lebanon....the Cedar, a coffee pot, a book, one assumes a religious one but who knows which one as Lebanon is a country of many religions. You can actually pull a tiny sliver of gold off the top of the book and inside are tiny paper pages written in Arabic. It links me to an important part of my families life. This spring, we took our first trip to Beirut together, 52 years after my siblings were last there (I was born much later, once we moved back to London).
It's precious because it tells a personal story. 
Even if you knew nothing about it, you'd be intrigued.
It's an interesting looking item. It has my real name 'Katherine Elena' engraved onto the disc.
It doesn't have a safety chain so I don't wear it. I should do something about that as I'd like it to serve a purpose, instead of being hidden away in a drawer. We have been burgled 3 times so I do have reason to hide my precious things;) Live your values through your products - and via your employees and your care of them. 
Look after people and they will create beautiful work for you.
There is no other way.

Regarding the actual work/the brand/the product - ask your customers what they want.
Ask them how they use your products. Ask them what their challenges are when they get dressed and leave the house each morning and need something to put their stuff in. What we wear and how we present ourselves to the world is so fundamental. 
When what you wear and what you carry with you is doing some of the heavy lifting, it helps. 
It's acknowledged and appreciated. It builds loyalty.

On a related note and to give an example, pockets in women's dresses and skirts are a classic example. 
Historically, pockets for women have been scarce. One can speculate on the reasons for this but the point is, women have busy lives and they need places to put stuff.
A brand gets instant kudos and loyalty when it recognises and acknowledges a basic need, in this case for pockets - and puts some in.

Collaborate and Co-create products WITH your customers
I long to be asked what I think - and how I would evolve the products that I love, by a brand that I love. To contribute.

There is also no need to radically change every single item every season. When a woman - or, I imagine, a man - finds a product they love, its disheartening when it disappears, never to return. How to win hearts? Hear your customers when they say they love something and keep giving it to them. Diane Furstenburg knows this. Patagonia know this. 


Much wider than this, in the context of culture and society: we need to practice listening to each other. 
To give each other a fair hearing. To not leap down each other's throats and in the hope of scoring woke points off each other. 
This is an unattractive modern affliction dressed up as something worthy. Its actually alienating and it divides people. 
We need to create spaces where people can talk, listen and learn from each other.

The people with interesting thoughtful ideas are not getting heard because they are scared of putting their heads above the parapet. The shouty extroverts have taken the stage - I have no issue or dislike of shouty extroverts! We need ALL kinds to make the world go round - the issue is that social media appears to polarise people and it doesn't always represent the nuance and the shades of grey and actually, I believe that ironically, most people want and need the same things but its very easy to believe otherwise. Which is a shame. We need to come together, not separate.

A random thought: I was gutted when I had to sell my first car (I needed to drive an automatic due to a foot injury). 
It was a cute little red vintage Renault 5. How I loved that car! Such a neat nippy little European car. 
It made me feel good. It was an extension of myself.
To make myself feel better about selling it, to acknowledge the journey we had been on together, I discretely carved my initials into a tiny space on the paintwork on the inside of the car. I wanted to represent our story together!
I wonder if you could do something similar with bags and small leather goods. 
With the rise of resale within established brands and vintage, its something to think about. 

Or perhaps you could tell stories about the people who actually make the items?",Stitch,
296569,Jaime,Garcia,d.jaime.garcia@gmail.com,"1.  A Moleskine and a pen.
This probably, apart from being the items I mostly carry around with me every time, are the objects that could define the kind of person I am:  Curious, explorer, always ready to get an impression of what I sense.  A tool for communication.

2.  A Denon turntable.
Music constantly brings joy to my life, and apart from the different albums I enjoy listening, perhaps the turntable is the object that best represents my joy: The scratch of the needle, the ritual of listening and turning the vinyl, the different styles expressed in the album arts, I take a break on my weekends to simply enjoy this moment.

3.  A pair of EYEVAN7285.
As perhaps has been already noticed from the previous images, I do enjoy and celebrate details, the craft of an object, the small rituals generated either during the manufacturing or while using the products, the building of an experience.  This pair of shades is a good example of the things I am passionate about:  Attention to details, the balance of elements (materials, textures, colours), the authenticity, the fact that you feel special once you are carrying/wearing these shades. Item 1
Coin Pouch.
In Japan is very common to end up your day with 'a lot' of coins, and if you don't have a way to keep them and get them ready to be used at any time you will simply end up with pockets full of 1 Yen coins.  The fact of this item being small, allows me to carry it anywhere and have access to its contents anytime.  Being small and having just one big pocket gives me easy access and visibility of the contents.  At the same time, the round shape and details of manufacturing allow me to feel it and find it easily in busy luggage.

Item 2
Kindle Cover.
This one and my wallet made me think about how small are the items when we talk about 'small items'.  Compared to a piece of luggage or a clothing item, these 2 are definitely small, however, compared to a pen case or a coin pouch, a wallet might be a bigger item.  
Kindle is already a good example of compact items: Instead of carrying the 1,000 pages book, you are having it all in one tiny device.  And its cover, apart from protecting the device, has similar intention of the device itself which is:  Carrying only what is required, a pocket for a Kindle and an additional pocket for some cards or cash, the commuter pass.  The simplicity and functionality are here shown together. a.  I have chosen these two items as they are part of my daily activities.  I carry them around, people can see the moment I am about to use them, they have become a sort of my personal signature

b. Leather has been important because:
-  Protect my belongings without having to carry anything heavy or bulky
-  Leather ages well.  Although at very beginning I was a bit doubtful about having leather items, I realized it was based on how the items look new.  Once they have aged, the appearance becomes more interesting in my personal opinion
-  Is flexible, I can fold, sit on it, without worrying that these items are going to be broken
-  In most of the cases, these leather items have a warranty, and the brands who produce them also offer maintenance for the best care of these items (this is a value-added)
-  Express some elegance (I owned a recycled tyre wallet before, and after a couple of months all the contents start becoming black!)
-  Leather is a sign of the times.  The older you get, the better the materials, the more crafted, the more aware we become about quality.  And leather fits well any age, and it gets just more refined in its techniques as older as we become
-  There is a world of techniques, types of leather, finishings, matching materials, and this is proof of its versatility. In answering this question I thought about what luxury means to me.  And I believe, beyond a brand name or a price tag there is a high-quality and high-care about the way the goods are made.  The use of excellent materials, the involvement of traditional communities and techniques in -perhaps- non-traditional ways, in order to elevate the status of a product, to consider them a luxury.

I have uploaded here 3 products:

1. EYEVAN 7285 Sunglasses.
Once you appreciate this pair of shades, you automatically think of luxury:  The care of manufacturing, the subtle details without overdoing it.  The careful selection of materials and finishings, make it a luxury item. In the case of the brand and this item, the fact of being hard to find gives its uniqueness an additional meaning of luxury.

2. Monterrey Panama Hat.
Apart from the visible craftsmanship involved in the manufacturing of this hat, and the uniqueness a material and a style can confer to this item, I can add luxury can be also related with an experience: The experience of having an item that has been custom-made for you, the experience of being present when the product was manufactured, the experience of meeting the community that participates of the product manufacturing.
In the case of this hat, I was there when it got manufactured and adapted to my preferences, after having seen/tried other different models.

3. Ascaso Espresso Machine.
With this image, I wanted to highlight additional thinking about luxury.  In this case (there is a careful selection of materials, colours, processes) the experience of enjoying an espresso at home, where you can get your own materials and build rituals around your own items, it develops s a new sort of luxury.  In the way everyone can listen to music on Spotify or Itunes music, but not everyone has the opportunity of playing vinyls on your own turntable, in the same way, this Ascaso machine becomes luxury for what it represents and the rituals it enhances. I believe I have already shared all the items I had in mind when I think of small, leather and luxury.  If -from all the images provided- I have to choose the one that represents all the elements together, perhaps the coin pouch can be a good example (plus, is the smallest of the items shared here)

This pouch was also designed and crafted for me, colours and finishings were recommended, and although at the beginning I did not like it, along the years it has become a piece I carry everywhere, it has aged pretty well. From these items:
a. 2 are needed to carry money with me: Coin pouch and wallet
b. 3 are needed in case I have spare time: Kindle, sketchbook, pen.
In here, the pen I carry depends on the place I go, and depends on the space I have to carry stuff:  If I am having just my pockets or a small bag, I will only take with my a fountain pen (or a pen, or a pencil).  If instead I am having with me a bigger bag, or in case I am going to work on a specific project, I will carry my pencil case and fill it with the utensils I consider important. This is an interesting question.

- At the moment the items I have shown all along this activity are important and meaningful to me, they are precious to me at a certain point and under certain circumstances.  

However, if there is something I could consider very precious is my sketchbook.  But there is something important about it:

- What makes my sketchbook valuable, precious, and important to me is not necessarily the sketchbook in itself, but its contents, all the notes, sketches, stickers I add to it.

Every year since I live in Japan, by the end of December I buy a new notebook. Plain, flexible cover, easy to carry around.  And during the year I write and draw my own calendar, create my own icons for specific activities and add stickers of events I join or perhaps labels I want to remember.

- Which means, my sketchbook might not be as precious at the beginning of the year as it is in December.

Everywhere I go I must carry it with me, it makes me feel safe in a way (""I will not run out of a surface where to doodle something out""). In similar ways as with books, once I get in my sketchbook I could spend hours just testing something out: A new pattern, a new face, a new logo.  It is relaxing, confident, and from time to time help my brain to remember important things.

What would I change to make it better?...hmmm... Not sure about it.  Anything I think in changing, I would test by the next year. I believe fashion has been always in search to communicate the values of a future generation. But at the same time, it has constantly been looking to be supported on solid elements from the past to expose them to current generations, and later translate them into what the present lifestyle might tend to adopt as own. 
These elements could be brought associated with social eras (Gucci and its 'renaissance' or the not-so-new 'New Romanticism' brought by Vivienne Westwood) or perhaps artistic movements (Louis Vuitton and its Masters Collection). Arts & Crafts in a way have become more accessible to younger generations thanks to luxury brands, and this connection grants them a higher position in people's minds.  
One of the first things that come to my mind, and would like to explore more in-depth is the possibility to bring this generation closer to the realities of other communities in different locations around the world.  The same way brands have travelled around collecting the most representatives artworks, in order to show them to a spectator, the same way I am suggesting these brands to collect stories, traditions, ways of doing things, and introduce them to an audience avid of these kinds of experiences.
I consider my hat a piece of luxury because I am aware of the tradition, materials and process it went through before it became mine. If in the same way, these stories were visible, easily differentiable from others, and people could get to learn, appreciate and make them their own, the future of leather goods could symbolize a new luxury.",Stitch,
341336,Naomi,Palovits,palovitsn@gmail.com,"An object that best represents who you are as a person.
The Piano Dress

An object that brings you joy in life.
Any piece from my jewellery collection


An item that shows what you are passionate about.
An image from my sketchbook I like my Vivienne Westwood wallet and my Louis Vuitton purse the most. I find small leather goods that work as organisers are a must in these accelerated times, you cannot live the house without a few essentials, like your credit cards, some cash, including change and a few extras. In my case, I always carry a photo of my daughter, a few business cards from people I´ve just met and tickets from my recent purchases. For a long time wearing leather has been a sensible topic in most parts of the world and in my country is no exception. Although Mexico has a large leather industry from which a good percentage of the population depends, conscious consumers demand more sustainable options.

Personally, I am not entirely sure which one is better or more sustainable: wearing leather vs wearing vegan leather. Because I am not sure what exactly is vegan leather, I read recently that its not as great as they thought it was. 

Personally, my purchase habits are somewhat influenced by their impact in the environment and I try and think twice before I make the wrong decision and become part of the problem, instead of part of the solution. 

The last large leather item I bought is a vintage biker jacket, which I got in Montreal, where leather and even fur are still ok, specially if you got them at vintage shops.

However when it comes to small goods, I tend to think it´s different. I do not feel guilty, or as guilty. Bags and purses made of materials other than leather rarely survive the test of times, mostly they break immediately, forcing you to replace the item with another item. 
 
So I think it is confusing. I see a lot of designers still using leather and trying to be sustainable at the same time. Conclusion: I am a confused consumer, I need more information in order to make my purchase decisions. The quality of these pair of platform shoes from Saint Laurent is amazing. The lines, the stitching, the weight of the shoe is obviously another level. You can tell the difference between high end and high street in an augenblick.
I love this top by Vivienne Westwood because of its timelessness quality: anyone at any age will look cool on it. It´s also one of those pieces you could wear for day or evening. With leather trousers will be perfect as well as with shorts or leggings and boots, or for the club with a mini skirt and high heels, the design itself is clever, sophisticated and highly flattering. A favourite is a small Valentino clutch bag which makes you want to get ready and go out. I never wear it though as I am a person that loves to carry lots of things so small is complicated. Unless you put it inside a bigger purse which is what I do sometimes.

The Balenciaga bag ""I love Techno"" is on my shopping list, because I do love techno, and the Chanel watch too, because Coco was the most revolutionary women and she was well ahead of her time. A unique piece like that watch is the perfect reminder of her legacy. Depending on the plan for the day, items in my bag may vary. From a sketch book and colour pencils, to a magazine or a book, I always have to carry some sort of entertainment, I leave the house not really knowing what I may end up doing, because I am very spontaneous and I make sure I block space in my agenda to do just that, something that was not planned. 
I could start my day going to the gym and end up at an art exhibition or a movie premier. So most times I carry an extra pair of shoes. I like big bags because they allow the nomadic lifestyle. Also, I am the curious type who would take a detour to explore a little street or shop I have never been before and I always end up finding interesting treasures: vintage postcards, books, mags and other things I later use for inspiration or simply to start a collection. These little explorations keep me intrigued and inspired, life is nothing but a deep, long, fun search, I think. I have issues with precious. Not too long ago I had the opportunity to meet Jeff Koons and he drew something for me; a few years ago, a similar situation happened with another prominent contemporary rockstar, Damien Hirst. Their doodles are obviously precious items because of their immense value and what that will mean in the future. However there are two or more items I consider really precious and I have lost them. One of them is a bundle of letters my father sent to his Hungarian little town documenting my childhood with photographs and Hungarian words, the other is a rock that came from the moon! I know this sounds crazy, BUT I can assure you it is for real. About 10 years ago, my good friend Amanda, an artist who now lives in Berlin, invited me to spend a weekend at her villa near Mexico City, turns out her crazy sculpture neighbour had his birthday, the house was filled with wonderful creations both inside and outdoors, you could tell this was a serious artist and that he know what he was talking about. At some point he took me and my friend to a secret room in that house and he pulled out a drawer fully organised where he kept special stones, gems and rocks. He gave me and my friend a rock that he claimed it came from the moon. Unfortunately I never got the chance to confirm that with NASA or any local geologist, after moving so much from one place to another the rock got lost. I am not sure if I answer your question. This was supposed to be about fashion, right?? Ok. My most precious item in terms of fashion is a jumpsuit I found at a vintage market in Mexico City, it´s very 80s. Black with gold. I don´t have it with me so I cannot include a pic. I would advise this brand to take the following steps to lead the way to the future of luxury and become an authority in its industry, by transforming itself and sharing that transformation with the world as part of their campaign. 

1. Measure your sustainability impact and act upon it (immediately).
2. Innovate. Find new sustainable methods and make adjustments. 
3. Document the whole process with the help of a young and actively devoted film director with solid credentials, such as Eva Aridjis.
4. Negotiate with Netflix to feature that documentary in their platform. If that does not work, try Amazon Prime.
5. Create a campaign to spread your commitment to the world and reach consumers with the first ever fully sustainable collection

The movie was great because it was not positioned as a plant based movie, simply a movie about health and fitness so appealed to a huge audience.

I’m also a huge supporter of Sea Shepherd who promote plant based living and have amazing celebrity endorsements. Their image is one of strength (not underweight, starving hippies)

In terms of supermarket brands, I can’t think of any amazing plant base brands. I like Naked Tofu but it’s not a hugely strong brand. I don’t like Quorn- highly processed and unhealthy. If it was processed or contained anything artificial, this makes it unhealthy and defeats the purpose of plant based diets. I love Naked Tofu. It has a very mild flavour so can be transformed into anything. I use it for all types of cuisine such as Thai, Italian and Indian. With a few spices, it is an entirely different dish. I also change the consistency. Sometimes I cut it fine, squeeze out the liquid, dry it with a hairdryer and then oven bake or fry to make it crispy. Other times I use it whole in a block, coat in starch and deep fry to keep the inside soft and supple  to create an authentic Japanese agedashi tofu. I LOVE Gu but it is soooo unhealthy and fattening. I was very excited to see plant based GU. It sounds guilt free! It is """"Free From"""" surely that means it is free from anything naughty. It is gluten free, vegan and plant based- triple ticks! 

It looks so healthy and natural, how could it not be healthy when there are lovely succulent lemons on the packaging which is a beautiful, organic, oatmeal colour and lots of guilt free words """"Free from"""" """"Gluten free"""" """"Vegan"""". I can have my cake and eat it!

Oh yes and it is on sale- no brainer!! It is dairy free and """"Proven to lower cholesterol""""- the """"proven to lower cholesterol really stands out. It also suggests one bottle a day- this sounds like medicine combined with fresh, healthy tropical fruits and is dairy free so must be amazing. If that isn't enough, it also has vitamin B1!!!

The green, design of a heart, pictures of fresh fruit and rounded font all feel super natural and healthy. Yes I do think about my heart health as I am in my 40s and my father had a quaduple bypass and both grandfathers died of heart disease. I workout daily, get annual health MOTs and eat well to be healthy. I also track my activity on Apple Health to make sure I am active. I love the concept and I would buy your products. A few suggestions:

*Keep 100% plant based phrase (Don't mention vegan)
*Rephrase some of the ingredients to sound more natural and healthy e.g. use terms such as oats, springwater, thickener. Remove words that sound processed and artificial
*Promote cholesterol lowering on packaging
*Make packaging look fresher e.g. water droplets on the fruit
*Make it clear what the products actually are on the packaging e.g. oat drink, oat yoghurt
*Price competitevely to other plant based products using the same space on the refrigerated shelf",Sprigg,

When I think of championing the lifestyle I think of people - eg Lewis Hamilton or media such as the film 'The Game Changers'

Sure there are brands in the space such as Alpro or The Tofu Company but I wouldn't admire any in particular for championing the lifestyle. Feel they champion their product but not the broader lifestyle. It wasn't organic.

or I didn't feel confident about the brand Tofu - so incredibly versatile - provides a different texture to a meal than fresh veg. Not quite sure what you mean by 'conscious choice'  - perhaps one not driven by your requirements?

1. I chose this dairy free desert with some fruit mixed in. I chose it because occasionally I like to give myself a treat after a good day. It is also the fist time I have seen this so I thought I would experiment. It is quite small so it doesn't matter too much if I get it wrong. Like the idea of using coconut milk as this is different from the regular soya and nut products that dominate the supermarket shelves. 

2. Like the others (although different brands) the packaging is very simple - three colors - white, yellow/orange, black - with a basic drawing of two people picking coconuts - almost 'tribal'. When I think of coconuts I think of sunshine,  islands, happy times - health. I also like the inclusion of the word 'collaborative' telling me that this wasn't just another Limited Company or multinational. When I think of the word 'collaborative' I think of a group of farmers getting together to share resources and produce something of sufficient scale that can be sold at market. So - perhaps I am helping the little guy - not sure! 1. Each year I invest in a private blood test which provides results for over 50 measures. This is a specific group of tests for athletes seeking to maximise their performance. My cholesterol levels have been higher than the recommended 'good' range so I have targeted this as an area I wanted to improve. Dietary cholesterol is only a small contributor to one's levels as the body produces its own cholesterol but every bit helps so I have been looking for foods which have evidence in reducing cholesterol levels. Benecol is one of these foods. I am not happy that it is dairy based but have sacrificed this to see if it can make a difference. The jury is still out. I chose Benecol over similar products as it was probably one of the first movers in this space and likely to have more intense scrutiny. 

2. Light blue is my favorite color so this immediately played into my comfort zone. Similar to the other products I have chosen, the front labeling is simple, clear, uncluttered. Making the key statement I was looking for 'proven to lower cholesterol' on the front helped with the speed of decision making. Also, the reference to vitamin B1 helped. Reference to plant stanols also helped me to know that I was looking at the right product. Of course, I also need to have confidence in the Advertising Standards Authority regulation of this message but I think in the UK this is all fairly reliable. I love strawberries for health as well as taste and the vivid picture sealed the deal for me. 1. Yes - heart health is important to me. I don't have any problems but I know that heart disease is one of the main causes of death so to the extent I can consciously avoid foods that will increase this risk I do and conversely if I have the opportunity to eat foods which will reduce this risk I will. 

2. I run 30km per week and do resistance training 4 times per week. The cardio and strength work are great for the heart and my resting pulse is typically 40 or below blood pressure around 110/70. To be fair I have this training regime because the endorphins make me feel great, I sleep well, think more clearly. For me these are the primary drivers and actively pursuing heart health is secondary. ",Sprigg,ENTJ

Don't avoid the fun stuff.
It's always time for crackers & cheese.
Drink sensibly. Exercise has disappeared during the Pandemic. My favourite exercise is swimming. Oatly - I like their brand tone of voice & graphical art style. Plus their barista milk is one of the best on the market.
Vivera - their meat alternatives have a great texture & taste great too. If it looks like it's trying to be too close to the 'real thing' & not pulling it off. An example would be The Meatless Farm Co.'s sausages. They look like human flesh wrapped in artificial sausage skin. They're just creepy. They appear to be a brand aiming at the transitioning crowd or occasional veggies.

Linda McCartney in particular goes the opposite way and look distinctly non-sausage like (other than overall shape obviously).

I've tried The Meatless Farm Co. sausages and the texture was not for me. They were oddly smooth in mouth feel, almost like a puree. Which is to some extent what you might expect from their look.

Whilst I love the vivera steak whilst bleeds, I prefer plant based alternatives that know what they are and don't feel the need to resemble the meat original. Whilst I do miss some meats, such as real mince, I'm aware that I can't have it now. It almost feels like I'm destined to feel disappointed when I try a product pretending, because it's impossible to replicate the taste & texture of meat, so they're always going to let you down.

Stick somewhat close to the known foods (I don't want a product called 'veggie blobs'), but if you're going to copy something, use it as reference point, don't try to emulate it. They're my go to sausage.

I love the texture because they don't pretend to be the 'real thing'. They are both crispy & chewy.

They're low maintenance, as you don't need to oil them to cook them.

They're consistent as the recipe and style hasn't changed in the decades(?) I've been eating them. Design - Quorn is pretty classic now. I'm not actually a big lover of the packaging in general. By that I mean, if it was new to the market now I'm not sure i would pick it up over other products, but because of its heritage & consistent brand colour it is still a go to.

Conscious - I like these because they are as good as the meat alternative it is aping. This means it a great party or picnic food to introduce meat eaters to so they can enjoy vegetarian food.

Ease - these are a great product to bulk out a lunch, they're tasty & they travel well in a bag!

Healthy - unlike the meat alternative there are only greens & oranges on the traffic light system. This makes me more inclined to buy these as I'll generally devour the whole pack if given the chance.

Food value - the inclusion of the peppercorns is a nice little touch to imply the product includes real ingredients. Full disclosure I'm in isolation with Covid so this one was hard. I went through the refridgerated products and non jumped out as being overly healthy (other than items I've already discussed).

Whilst this isn't health it appears healthier if you're planning to have a dessert.

Food value - the inclusion of fruit implies natural unprocessed ingredients.

Copy - pushing the ""150 kcal"" & calling it ""Light"" makes it feel like a healthy alternative to other products on the market, in particular other Gü products.

Design - the contrasting colours nicely match the product it self. I like being able to see the food I'm buying and the distribution of layers. We all know products don't always resemble the photo, seeing the product builds trust and prevents buyers remorse. 

Quality - The inclusion of foil on the clear glass jars adds a degree of quality to the product. It feels premium. Heart health is not front & centre for me as I'm still relatively young, fit & healthy. 

I try to eat healthily & before Covid I regularly went to the gym. Sorry, my video ended up being way longer than I planned :person_facepalming:‍♂! Hopefully there's something of value in there that you can snip out.",Sprigg,INTJ

Plant Hub (https://www.planthub.net/) in Hackney London is a creative plant-based restaurant. They also have classes in the space where you can learn to make things that are on the menu. It always feels like an educational experience every time I've been. I think there's still so much to learn from plant-based living and a real opportunity to share this knowledge. I think there are certain brands that are too expensive and clearly invest more in branding and marketing. Sometimes there can be still non natural additives or ingredients that I'm not familiar with that would put be off buying a product. I'm not a huge butter eater but this vegan block is really great alternative. One of the best things is it is ideal for cooking and unlike other non-dairy butters, this really does taste good. I like that it's not contained in plastic too. 1) Choosing a dairy alternative spreadable requires more conscious thought as there are a lot of options out there of low fat dairy spreadable butters and non-dairy alternatives. This Naturli product is more conscious as there are very few ingredients in it and it says the main three on the front without having to read the full list of ingredients. 
2) The branding is simple and nicely designed. It looks contemporary without feeling 'too vegan'. 1) I've been interested in kefir for gut health. I've tried growing my own culture but failed so I was interested in this readymade one. 
2) This one doesn't look too 'branded'. It looks and feels like an independent producer. I like how the bottle is similar to old glass milk bottles. 1) Yes - physically and emotionally!

I like to eat foods I've made from scratch and load all my meals up with lots of vegetables where possible. I like to know what's in the food I'm eating and more recently this has become a necessity due to my dietary requirements. 
I like to try and buy local and sustainable produce where I can. Swimming. I love swimming - it works my entire body, clears my mind and I love the feeling of being submerged in water. It is the perfect therapy! Coconut Collaborative. 
I love their products and packaging. Though their packaging makes it clear their products are plant-based, they don't appear to rely on this their primary marketing tool and instead focus on making their products appealing to consumers.
Their products themselves are delicious and I would often choose to eat their products over the animal-based equivalent! 
They also provide lots of informative information and environmentally friendly packaging which I really like. Price and/or the added ingredients.
Plant based products are rarely on sale when compared with animal-product equivalents. Though an entirely plant based lifestyle is cheaper, for those who live  flexibly between the two may choose to go for the animal-based equivalent if they are cheaper or they're on a tigher budget that week/month. 
Another factor I would consider is the nutritional information - if there are a number of ingredients or additives, such as lots of sugar, then I would rather buy the animal-based alternatives as I would see that as being a healthier option. I love this coconut yogurt! It has a wonderful texture, and flavour and feels healthy (despite the higher saturated fat content). It is a versatile yogurt and eat it at breakfast, add it to smoothies, curries, soups, and enjoyed it as a low-calorie alternative to ice cream or cream with puddings. 
It has such a brilliant flavour and it's a regular staple in my fridge and diet! 1) I noticed these choc pots a few months ago and have been intrigued by them for a while, it was only through this project that I actually picked them up and noticed they were also a conscious choice! 
The packaging note that their product is ethically sourced and they plant trees which I felt was a great option as a conscious choice due to the environmental benefits it appears to have. It was not a health conscious choice, rather an ethical and environmentally conscious choice!

2) I love the purple packaging- it colour stands out as does the small size of the choc-pots and the calorie count for each. 
I liked that i could see the size of the choc-pots so I wouldn't be disappointed when opening the box as they are fairly small in size. 
I noticed the writing on the inside of the packaging when I was in the supermarket and was really intrigued on what it said! I was quite eager to get home and open it so I could find out more. 
I also noticed the great taste award on the packaging which made me interested to try it out! I chose the Innocent Hazelnut milk for this option as well. My local supermarket didn't have a huge range and this was the only one which offered a benefit which I was interested in. That is, a source of vitamin E which contributed to healthy skin and boosting the immune system. With my recent diagnosis of an autoimmune disease and the skin troubles that followed I am trying hard to boost my immune system and care for my skin from the inside out. Whilst this wasn't a starring feature on the products packaging, in looking further at the back of the bottle I picked up on this health benefit. Along with the appeal of natural ingredients I felt this was a natural choice which targeted a specific health/nutritional benefit.
2) I love the clear bottle- I associate the product with tasty chocolate milk!
I am a big fan of  simple packaging with fun and quirky phrases, pictures and statements. I feel it gives a modern and young vibe to the products and company and they seem in touch with what we want. I like the different font used on the front of the bottle.
I really liked the back of the packaging which included fun pictures and suggestions for how to use the milk, including my favourite and intended use (hot chocolate- not a paddling pool!)
The nutritional benefit was not a stand out feature though was easy to find and provided some explanation for what vitamin E is good for. 1) Not currently. I'm under 30 and aside from general consideration for my health and wellbeing (exercise/eating well/sleep) I don't give heart health specific thought. 

2) Not aside from trying to maintain general health and wellbeing. Something else I should have suggested was adding some information about where the fruits/other key ingredients are sourced from- whilst they might not be local, it would add more to the ability to trace the ingredients used in the product.

A wee transcript of my video is below:
Hi Benecol, I'm excited to be helping to create the perfect plant-based product. Benecol Oat sounds like a great product and I love that it has so many health benefits. I think the bright and colourful packaging is a real draw card and I'd suggest using fun and quirky phrases to explain the brands ideals and the ingredients used. I'd suggest focussing on all of the health benefits rather than cholesterol alone- if applicable I'd be talking about how the product can maintain and keep a heart healthy- i think that'd be a real draw card for me.
I'd also suggest highlighting the size of the company and the traceability of the ingredients used, such as oats within 200km of the factory. If you could provide some extra info about the fruits and other key ingredients used that would add a little more to this.
I've enjoyed collaborating with you and can't wait to try the product when it hits the shelves!",Sprigg,
398152,Giulia,Sciota,giulia.sciota@hotmail.co.uk,"Positive, ambitious, adventurous, cheeky and nice. I try to not take things too seriously but to be considerate with everyone that I meet. I love humour, sports, reading, writing, animals and travel. My friends also say that I'm really active. Unless I'm ill, it's rare for me to stay at home and watch TV all day, for example. Comedy Very lame - but I love a cold glass of water! If alcoholic, then a very dry white wine 30 minutes of creative writing Royal blue Go on a long walk around a park, get some exercise, write and read (depending on my book), and either go out for some nice food or cook myself something comforting Fresh produce and fresh pasta I would love for everyone to have access to food and clean water Chocolate I try not to snack in the morning, but if I do I'll go for a piece of fruit or toast Ask for things & be adventurous I really try to eat ethically and in line with my own morals. As a rule, I try not to eat food where I know I could not do the process myself, finding it hypocritical to let someone else do the dirty work, so to speak. I know that I would never be able to kill a lamb, or a cow, for example (unless it was life or death), so I do not eat meat. I have a particular problem with animals that are reared to be killed as babies, such as lamb and veal. I occasionally eat sustainably sourced fish and seafood, and have done this myself in the wild. I have cut out milk and most cheese / eggs due to my feelings on the dairy industry.

Environment and health are also really important to me. I always check ingredients and don't regularly eat food that is too processed, containing too many artificial ingredients, or that causes notable harm to the environment (such as palm oil). It's not something I'm a complete expert on, but I try to keep up with reading and make choices that I feel are in line with my beliefs.

In terms of drinks, I mainly drink water. I also drink 1-2 coffees a day and the occasional diet coke or pepsi. In my coffee I'll add cinnamon and whatever plant milk is floating around my cupboard (usually oat or cashew). In terms of alcohol, I love wine of all kinds and beers, and will occasionally have a gin or a rum. I'd say I'm a real yin / yang here. I do the most yoga, but I also really love boxing and kickboxing. In terms of mind exercise, I love reading and brain apps like Elevate. Speaking honestly, I can't think of one specific brand which ticks every single box. My favourite at the moment is probably Beyond Meat - first of all, they have created a truly delicious product which I think genuinely beats burgers in terms of taste, consequence for the planet, and actual nutritional value. I have enormous respect for this and I think it's how plant-based brands can win the market - in food, the flavour just has to be there if you're competing with the mass market. I also love how they present themselves - with few words, unapologetic, with catchy meaningful slogans and modern branding (I find a lot of plant-based brands can have quite old-fashioned looking branding, I'm not quite sure why).

Another brand I admire and buy regularly is Oatly. They also push the flavour message, alongside the sustainable angle. The communicate in a way that is edgy, snappy and memorable. I do think that they could use brighter colours to grab people's attention - I worry that sometimes their branding doesn't appeal to younger people. Although their shade of blue is certainly very memorable. The biggest reason for me lack of nutritional value. If I see a lot of additives or E-numbers, artificial ingredients and preservatives, I just won't buy it. I'd rather buy the ingredients myself and make a healthier version. The next biggest reason is taste. Self-explanatory, but if it doesn't taste good, I won't buy it.

I also wouldn't buy a plant-based alternative if I disagreed with the brand stance. For example, after I read the insulting comments Rude Health's founder made against vegans, I never bought their products again, even though I used to love the look of their brand and their granolas. This is my newest obsession and perfect for the winter! They're really hearty, creamy, healthy plant based soups. They come in three varieties (at least at my local Waitrose): this one, which is my favourite. The second is Kale, Spinach and Turmeric (also in my fridge and freezer), and the third one is Carrot and Ginger. They all have very few added ingredients and are incredibly filling and flavourful. They're full of vitains and free from cream, milk, gluten, flour, added sugars and artificial ingredients. It debunks the myth that soups need things like milk and butter to be delicious. They have the added bonus of being low calorie, which is beneficial in lock down where I'm feeling more sedentary. Plus, they last about two weeks from when you purchase them. Healthy sustainable, delicious and convenient. Plant-based milks are an interesting one. Aside from coconut milk, I like them all (rice milk, soy milk, almond, hazelnut, cashew, etc.). I do think Oat goes best with my coffee. The reason I picked this one was that it had its carbon footprint on the front and that it's verified by the FSC.

Looking at the packaging closer, I've realised there's also a tree within the A of Oat-ly - perhaps it had been subliminal? The only thing I wonder is whether it is sustainable to package in a Tetrapak container - I am a bit confused on whether these can be recycled by everyone (I don't see the recycling sign on the front or back) and this is something that I'd like to understand about the containers, as they may influence which plant based milk I buy.

I really like that Oat-ly's design is quite edgy - I love the exclamation mark and illustrations, the font even, and the cheeky messaging. I think the information is easily laid out and that they don't try to do too much on the front like other brands. I also think their blue has become quite distinctive and recogniseable. Overall, I feel that the brand is a great choice for plant-based milk. From what I understand, Oat is the most environmentally friend of milks, and I love that the benefits of this specific product are being communicated in a playful way (a lot of brand with healh benefits can feel too earnest). I picked this product because I actually hadn't seen a vegan yogurt with live cultures before (usually I see live cultures in thing like kombucha, which I'm not a big fan of). As usual, I liked that there are only three products, which makes me think that the product is not heavily processed.

I like that the packaging is plain and minimalist - this tends to communicate clean products for me. I like the logo and the design - it's all simple and easy to absorb. Even though there is a lot to say about the product (vegan, certified by soil association etc), they stick to the main selling points and don't ovewhelm the customer. The only think I would advertise more though is the vegan cultures- this is rare and for me the reason why I chose to purchase this one. If I hadn't been looking closely, I woud have missed the detail. I have to admit I don't know much about heart health, but I think about overall health a lot. I exercise, I eat a LOT of vegetables of almost every variety (especially dark, leafy greens), I take vitamins and iron supplements, I ensure that my nutritional intake is aligned to the recommended daily values (at least most of the time), I avoid overly processed food (most of the time), I try to ensure that I control stress and stay at a good weight, I don't smoke and try not to drink too much, I get my blood checked every year to ensure values look good. I think  good chunk of these address heart health,  but I don't actively do anything for my heart specifically. I think I mention it all in the video :)",Sprigg,INFJ

I don’t like processed food and I always buy free range when I ever buy meat or responsibly sourced for fish. I eat a lot more vegetarian meals than I ever did and eat a lot more vege/vegan snacks. I don’t like to deny myself food but I haven’t had McDonald’s or KFC since 2013 and I wouldn’t dream of having Nando’s since I discovered where the chickens come from in 2014. If I want a dirty burger I’d rather one than didn’t taste like plastic so I have a favourite place for that too! I avoid chain restaurants and do what I can to support local independent ones. I love good quality produce and go to the baker for my bread, various shops for my fruit and veg and if I buy meat I try and go to the butcher. Then I’d get the rest at the supermarket. I enjoy cooking and during lockdown I even attempted baking too! Overall I’d say I’m fairly healthy and also conscious of where my food comes from. Running. I can think of all sorts of things while I’m out. I can listen to music or make decisions about work or dinner! Linda McCartney instantly comes to mind because I love those sausages! Her products have been around for so long now! Soreen. I just love it! And it’s vegan! Though I wouldn’t say they are championing plant based living - they just happen to have vegan products! Alpro comes to mind too - their milk and yoghurt products. Quorn too! They always have celebrities promoting their products too. Flavour. Vegan cheese. I try it and I don’t like it. Also fake deli meats. I’ve found they taste synthetic. I love this soya milk. I have used this long before non-dairy milks were a ‘thing’. In coffee and muesli but also in baking it is my go-to non-dairy Plant based fave item. I have tried others that split in your coffee (no one wants that!) and when I went to Australia unless you went to a coffee shop, I struggled to find a plant based milk in a supermarket that didn’t split! Aside from water there isn’t much that isn’t processed. I looked at soups and I looked at drinks, but settled on this. I like the ethos: they use imperfect veges. Also it’s made in London so doesn’t travel far. The ingredients have nothing starting with an E and everything in the pot is an actual ingredient and not something processed. I like the packaging - it immediately makes me think of It being healthy because of the green! Turmeric. It’s been around forever but only recently has it appeared in all health food and even mainstream supermarkets. I always thought it was over rated till I tried it! 

The packaging isn’t that exciting. It says what it is and the shot itself is pretty in colour. But I’m a marketers dream, I bought it! :) I run a lot and so keep pretty fit and my weight stays down. I’m conscious more of strokes than heart health but that is more because of my family history. 

So, personally I don’t think about heart health too much. I think I’ve said everything already! But I just noticed this second that Oatly does ice cream (I had no idea - I just saw it in a little Tesco Express near me as I was walking past the freezer!) so, I never even knew there were oat based ice cream or yogurt items already on the market. I’m very much into soya and so think this slipped by me (though I have bought the Oatly milk!) 

People will love the packaging and there is a massive market out there who care about lowering cholesterol (my dad has had 2 strokes so he is always getting low cholesterol foods) and heart health is important to people too. Super good luck. :)",Sprigg,

Wine (alcoholic) Marmite on toast and a good cuppa. I used to always say purple but I'd say I'm more of a turquoise now (less youthful angst...) It's a tough one because it would either be:

- A day of exploring somewhere new, taking myself off on a potter around a new town or city or maybe on a long walk somewhere to shake the cobwebs away
- Or create a super cosy day of self-care at home with a long bath, hot chocolate and a good film on the sofa, comfort food and good music while I'm cooking The snacks and chocolates!! Definitely the environmental impact of the food industry. Anything chocolatey. Or trashy tv shows! Usually something sweet like a biscuit, some chocolate, a yoghurt or fruity granola bar. To forget about other people's opinions of you, embrace your unique personality and don't ever try and conform to other people's boring expectations of you. 1. Curious and creative - never a bland or safe option for me on the menu, always trying to mix things up and try something new.

2. Wholesome and nourishing - where possible, avoid overly processed food more than once a day and make sure my plate is filled with lots of colour and variety

3. Contrasting flavours - e.g I love spicy food and I love creamy flavours, but I especially love both incorporated into one dish Definitely yoga although followed closely by running and spin classes. If I had more opportunities nearby I'd get back into dance classes as I trained for years as a child! I have always admired Oatly's way of communicating (although a bit disappointed with recent investment scandal) but I feel like they were the first alternative milk brand to really capture the attention of millennials. More recently, I'm a big fan of the Coconut Collaborative and Ombar chocolate. To be honest, I'm getting a bit tired of seeing new brands pop up that very cleverly market their plant-based options to young people in the guise of easy ready meals/snacks, or 'vegan fast food' when actually the amount of processing that goes into the meals almost counteracts the good it's trying to do by being plant-based. I would much prefer to buy a plant-based brand that comes from a whole, unrefined or overly processed production. I chose oat milk because this is the most regular plant-based product that I buy and consume almost daily. It was a conscious decision to switch to oat milk rather than cows milk when making cereal,granola or porridge so that my cows milk intake overall would be reduced. I love the creamy flavour oat has compared to other plant based milks, it works in most hot drinks i enjoy e.g coffee and hot chocolate without compromising on taste and texture. There's a certain aftertaste and satisfaction that you get from oat milk that is quite comforting too! The reason I chose this over other non-dairy yoghurts is the fact that it is coconut based which appeals to me so much more than other non-dairy recipes, I don't like the texture or taste of soya yoghurt for instance so coconut based yoghurts don't feel like a compromise over my usual dairy yoghurts. The peach and passion fruit flavour combo sounds really fresh and inviting especially with the ""Fruity & Fabulous"" tag line alongside it. It also appeals to me because it contains live cultures which is a bonus to get from a non-dairy yoghurt. I'd say this benefit along with it being dairy-free help me to choose it as a conscious product that can fit seamlessly into my flexitarian diet, without feeling like I'm losing out on a treat.

I like the vibrancy of the colours of the packaging against the natural feel of the Koko logo. It stands out on shelf because it feels like an exciting taste and  coupled with the fruit graphics that are bold and big on pack it makes it seem more of a treat than other competitors, maybe this also has something to do with their only being two in the pack rather than four? It might subconsciously seem more like a treat dessert than a yoghurt you'd eat mindlessly. I chose the Green Machine flavour of the Naked smoothies, because it's flavour description feels more health based than the other ones on offer. For some reason with it being green with added spirulina it comes across as being less sweet and more nutritionally balanced than other smoothies. Its quite blatant in its product description that it's aiming to be perceived as packed full of benefits e.g Boosted With Vitamins clearly visible on the label. 

I think the packaging is quite matter of fact and perhaps less modern in design than some competitors e.g Innocent smoothies, however, this jumped out at me because of it feeling quite straightforward in its ingredients with everything clearly labelled. The flavour name Green Machine also sounds powerful, making you believe that in a couple of sips you will feel the difference and gain some strength or energy. Being a convenient on-the-go product, seeing that the packaging is made out of 100% recycled plastic also gives it an edge over other products. 1) Broadly speaking yes, although it is not something that I actively adapt my diet to suit if that makes sense. 
2) I try to stay as active as possible, regularly meditate and try to keep stress levels down. I also believe that a wholefood diet full of good fats, protein and vitamins/minerals from fruit and veg is helpful and try to limit processed treat food as much as possible. I think it could be an idea to choose another complimentary colour that gets used for each product, to distinguish across the range.",Sprigg,

(I asked) I'd say something between drama and comedy. Hate to say this, but it would probably be like something written by Woody Allen. it depends on the time of the day. I wouldn't drink a Negroni in the morning. a coffee would be more appropriate for that occasion, I guess. a shower. my day doesn't start until I'm clean and with a fresh change of clothes green. feels like its kinda balanced, but different from gray which is so sad. probably make a coffee, set up a hammock and read a book if the weather is nice. hard to remember how that was before the pandemic, I think it used to be the spices and sauces one. I loved looking at them and thinking how they could improve my meals. or ruin them. would make being a billionaire illegal, automatically transferring all the excess money into a fund to end hunger and extreme poverty. getting good electronics deals from China. I don't usually have that, I try to be really strict about my eating habits in terms of not having anything between meals. the thing I have the most in the morning is a bowl of yogurt with nut granola and some honey. don't use all your energy on others. focus a bit more on yourself. Having a methodical approach to life, I like to structure it in a comprehensive way. A couple of books helped me develop this approach, being ""Cooked"" by Michael Pollan and  ""Clean"" by Dr Alejandro Junger the main influences. These lead me to create a couple of principles, being:

- trying to stick to as many natural ingredients as possible (the less industrialised something is, the better)
- trying to have a strict schedule for my meals
- reducing the amount of sugar and milk to the bare minimum
- having an open mind for new flavours and alternative ingredients/diets
- trying to accumulate more knowledge about cooking techniques and understanding the concepts of building flavour 
- a can do attitude in regards to preparing meals
- if I'm having something supposedly bad for my health, it better be really high quality

Some things I'm still working on are:
- reducing portions to only what is necessary
- using alternative ingredients as the rule and not the exception I really like yoga, although is hard to find the time for it in my routine, specially during the pandemic Quorn certainly comes to mind really quickly. I think its because they offer such a wide range of choices, from ingredients to snacks, that they really put themselves as one of the main brands helping the choice be a bit easier. I think its when its a soy-based product in a category where there are other choices. For an example: soy milk. I much rather get a nut based milk since there is an option. I really don't see the point into making anything with soybeans if there's an alternative base ingredient. Mostly because soybean farming is, very often, really bad for the planet hence the monoculture approach. When overconsumed, soy can also be unhealthy so it would make it an even stronger no. First of all, let me apologise for the depressing fridge I've got at the moment. I usually get my groceries delivered every 2 weeks  and I'm now past the period, so pretty depleted. I'll be sending pictures of products I don't currently have, but that I usually get if that is ok.


I think the cauldron are my favourite plant-based product for a couple of reasons:

- its not a substitution concept (like a meat free sausage). It it, instead, a decent fridge friendly version of a long time favourite for vegetarians and vegans.
- although the flavour and texture aren't the same when compared to a real fresh falafel, this is still really really good flavour and texture (which is usually really hard to nail for fridge friendly falafels).
- its versatile enough in a way that I can have it cold, hot, on its own as a snack, in a salad, in a wrap,  the possibilities for this one are endless, which gives this guys the highest step on the podium. Again, it came down to the lack of alternatives. I was actually looking for a coconut option from Innocent, but it wasn't available. I think its more conscious than its counterparts as it doesn't include soy milk, as they actually mention on the packaging. They also seem very conscious about the carbon footprint which I know can be a problem for oat based milk alternatives, so extra conscious points for that.

Seems like there's a trend for dairy alternative packaging. I'd say the first brand to break from this will gain attention on the shelves due to the contrast with their competitors. I might be wrong, but I have the impression that the handwritten + illustrations trend has actually started with Oatly itself. Apart from the colour palette and the handwriting, I think this is really classy. Probably worth mentioning that these carton packs are impossible to recycle so if they changed it to something compostable or more durable like glass, it would be even better. I'm not sure about the font used in the back for the ""Boring Side"" bit as it looks way more related to cheap horror films. Oatly clearly positions their products to be used in hot drinks such as coffee or tea, considering the illustration in the front with a cloud of steam coming out of the cup. While that is great, I think it reduces the many used this product has (I'll definitely use it to make some bechamel sauce). Ok, so this was a tricky one. I never thought about this before, but I realised most products don't promise any health benefits. When I got to the smoothie aisle though, that changed. I then figured that most smoothies promise something related to health / nutrition which was quite remarkable. I chose this over many other options from Innocent because of the mind brightening promise, which seems very desirable in the morning hahaha. There was also one option from Tropicana but the packaging wasn't as sexy and the promise was more related to boosting energy (with the addition of guarana I believe).

So, before talking about packaging, I should say the colour of this smoothie was rather intriguing. I struggled with the decision a bit as it didn't look very appealing (not a lot of blue food around) but the benefit promised really interests me. So I decided to take it even though I wanted the red one more.

I really like Innocent products packaging. They're very consistent in making their products look like they're higher quality than the competition. This one is not different with their iconic logo, nice colour palette (the blue makes sense here hence the product name). I love how the information is well balanced in terms of size, with a clear hierarchy. When looking at the whole line, its easy to spot the differences between each option since each information category is place on the same spot. In addition to all that, I love how they dedicated one side of the bottle to talk about the benefit specifically. Also very nice to see the ingredients grouped in an illustration, making it easier to spot whats in it without having to read the boring ingredient list. I think about it as part of my overall health but definitely not specifically about it. I try to have a balanced diet, with as many natural foods as possible as I'm aware of the health benefits or implications it could have, but that's not necessarily something I do actively having my heart health in focus.

As said above, the main health management system is diet. I used to have lots of walking pre-covid 19 which I really miss, but can't find the motivation for it without having a place to go. For the diet bit, I try to follow some key factors I've learned from the books I mentioned earlier in the study ""Cooked"" and ""Clean"", whilst not being too strict about it too. I figured as we have a limited time on earth, that also limits the amount of meals we can have (funny, I know) so I think having the best food I can is crucial, but I'm also aware of having fun (also limited time) combined with it and giving in to cravings of not as healthy things every now and then. My only added point with this video is in regards to pricing.
I feel like the first high quality dairy-alt brand to bring their prices to the same level as the competition will nail a huge chunk of the market. So I suggest that, if possible, OAT brings their prices in line with the competitors, taking the price off the decision making process. I hope that is possible, I don't know how the costs add up when Benecol adds their patented ingredient. Hope that helps!",Sprigg,
397620,Stephen,Moffitt,smoffitt@plusorminusseven.com,"I asked her and she said, ""He is kind-hearted and intelligent."" Science fiction. It has always been a step removed from ordinary life. When I was drinking, it was a very dry vodka martini. Now it is American-style drip coffee. Writing 3 pages long-hand and a 42-minute mediation. Navy blue... it has always been my favourite colour. Go for a long walk through London, ending up at Waterstones on Piccadilly where I would get lost in floors of books for a couple of hours, then go home and cook a fabulous dinner with my wife. The fresh fruit and vegetables. I am always on the look out for great, organic produce, particularly things I have not tried before. That people would love themselves more. A lot of other problems would end with that simple change. A big bag of salty crisps. I can go through it in one sitting if I don't pay attention. Fruit or a slice of gluten-free toast and peanut butter if I am really hungry. You are actually OK. You don't need to be so afraid of what others think. The key principles are: 
* Be simple: plain foods and few ingredients are usually better
* Eat and drink the best quality possible. That means, organic, chemical and additive free. 
* Listen to your body. It knows what you need and don't be a slave to any particular diet, idea or taste. 
* The emotion and the way food is prepared is as important as the ingredients There are different exercises for different parts. I have been mediating for 20 years. For a more active form of mediation, I run a couple of kilometers. For the emotions and for a more all-over physical exercise, I play 5-a-side football every Tuesday with a group of friends I first met when I did a piece of work at the BBC. I have not found a brand that is both plant-based and organic, or at least chemical and additive free. Most plant-based meats, for example, have preservatives and chemicals in them to create a ""meat"" taste. As I said in my previous question, what stops me is the fact that just about every product I pick up is full of chemicals that are not healthy and, ultimately take away from the benefits of being plant based. I chose this because it actually easy to find and inexpensive compared to other brands. The taste is pretty good and the texture is closer to meat sausage than others that I have tried. The one thing that I don't like about these, and every other plant-based meat substitute I have found (apart from tofu) is the fact that they use various chemicals for flavour, preserving or binding. As you might guess from my other replies, my choices tend to be conscious. That said, I do not normally buy almond milk. I make it at home from organic almonds, but if I did have to buy it, it would be this brand for the fact it is organic and has no additives or preservatives and is a reasonable price for the quality of the product. 

Again, the packaging is clean, minimal with a basic colour palette and the key information easy to find on the package. In general, I prefer not to have the sense I am being ""sold"" a brand so the more sober and minimal the packaging is, the more likely I am to look at the product. I have been looking for dairy-free products that also taste good and are not so full of preservatives. This was the first time I had come across almond-milk yogurt. I know the benefits of replacing dairy with almond milk, but, up to now, I have been continuing to eat dairy yogurt.

The packaging is within my aesthetic: clean, easy-to-scan and informative. It is not something that I am thinking about from a dietary perspective. I focus on stress as the key to having a healthy heart. The theme of ""healthy"" is not just related to a healthy heart, but a healthy me: what I put in me (natural, simple, non-toxic) and a healthy planet (products that are made sustainably and ethically). If this can be done at a reasonable cost, that is the winning combination.",Sprigg,

One of my fav veggies and my favourite plant based products are of course the unadulterated versions-plants!! 1) I looked initially for any products which has links to charities/food-banks etc- as this would have increased my likelihood of picking it. I chose this as it is organic, vegan, made locally and glass- which is more conscious than a lot of the others that are in plastic packaging as glass is easier to recycle. Also it seems to be a smaller company which makes it feel more conscious as really trying to buy from smaller brands more often in the whole world of 'support local'

- a communal experience Profiteering ie someone moving into the space who has no real belief in or commitment plant based food. I don't base my shop around plant based products. I base it around produce i.e. fruit, veg and dry goods. 'Products' are ancillary to this.  It's midweek and I don't have any 'products' left (so no photo).  My favourite though is Booja Booja ice cream. It's rich creamy, chocolatey moorish. They were one of the first suppliers of luxury vegan confectionery and ices but despite all the competition around now there products have stood the test of time . 1)  I chose this product because in comparisom with some of my other choices in this category this brand uses wonky veg and therefore reduce foodwaste, they make dishes where the food you're eaten is actually recognisable and forces you to chew... just as nature intended.

235011,Marcos,Rodríguez Velo,marcos.rodriguezvelo@gmail.com,"Concept A:
I like both texts, they give a good idea about the flask main goal: to keep the temperature. But I don't like the picture for Cold, it looks like the girl doesn't like the flask or wants to keep it far from her. The second picture works better with the 'Let's Go!' text.

Concept R:
The same as Concept A, the texts are good but the picture for Cold doesn't work. The girl is wearing warm clothes, so it gives the idea of drinking something cold during cold weather, and it doesn't fit very well.

Concept S:
I think the pictures are switched. The beach one should go with 'Cold', and the snow with 'Hot'. It seems contradictory. But the texts are intriguing, it makes me wonder about how the refreshment is sustainable and what makes it be that way. Concept A:
- La temperatura se mantiene vayas donde vayas.
- Acaba el día a la temperatura con la que empezaste.

Concept R: 
- Simple frescura durante todo el día. ('Pure' would be translated as 'pura', but in that case it would make a silly rhyme with 'frescura', so I changed it to 'simple')
- El café se mantiene como te gusta.

Concept S: 
- Ahora la temperatura perfecta es sostenible.
- La frescura es sostenible. (I don't like very much the word 'frescura' and how it sounds here, but I couldn't come up with a better one) A
1. The first thing that comes to mind is the word 'sustainable', it's what really stands out.
2. Something that is not clear is ""what's sustainable?"": the materials of which the flask is made?, how it is produced?, all of it?
3. 'Sustainable' is the main word here, so the idea is pretty straight forward.
4. The text works well in general, nothing to add.
5. I'm a bit confused with the picture, because it has very warm tones, but there is (not so much) snow, so it's not clear which idea it wants to transmit.
6. I would choose another picture to show the idea about the perfect temperature.

B
1. Like the previous one, the word 'sustainable' is the centre of attention. Pairing it with 'refreshment' gives the idea of something new.
2. Here the idea is more clear and everything is explicitly said.
3. I repeat what I said in the previous advert: 'Sustainable' is the main word here, so the idea is pretty straight forward.
4. Same as before. It works even better because it's just three words that sound very well and strong together.
5. The picture works very well. 'Refreshment' pairs with the water and 'sustainable' with the nature. Would be better a picture without any houses/buildings in it, just pure nature.
6. I think this advert works very well, simple but strong. A
1. The concept is fine for me. Maybe without the word 'now' would be better, but it also gives the idea of breaking with a non-sustainable past.
2. Like I said before: what's 'sustainable'?
3. Nothing.
4. The sentence works fine for me.
5. No negative connotations about the picture, but it's not clear what it wants to transmit.

B.
1. I like the concept here.
2. See the answer to the previous advert.
3. Nothing.
4. Sound perfect to me: simple, clear and straight forward.
5. I think the picture is almost perfect, I would only choose a landscape without buildings in it. A
The wording is fine, I wouldn't change anything about it, but the picture should be changed, maybe to a more snowy environment, more white and pure. There's nothing wrong with the picture itself, but it doesn't convey the idea of sustainability: there's snow, but not a lot, the earth tones give a warm feeling, and there are trees with and without leaves, giving a bad impression.

B
Same here, the text is clear and simple and you can get the idea very easily.
About the picture, like I mentioned, a landscape without human constructions in it would give a better idea about sustainability. But like it is right now, it works too. A
1. This advert makes me think that I can take my drink and have it ready for me, whether I go to the beach, the mountains or to work.
2. It's not said that the drink should be hot or cold, but the flask will keep it ready for you.
3. The main idea is that your drink will be always ready for you, no matter if you prepare it in the morning and has to last until later during the day.
4. The words are fine to me.
5. The picture works well too.
6. I think that the picture and words work very well next to each other.

B
1. Obviously the picture brings the idea of freedom, which makes sense with the idea because no matter what you do, your drink will always ready for you.
2. I think, like in the previous one, it's not said if the drink is hot or cold inside the flask, but you are free to choose whatever fits you.
3. Freedom to choose the drink that you want and have it ready during the whole day.
4. The sentence is very clear and concise.
5. The picture is very good in my opinion, it shows very well the idea of freedom.
6. I think that the picture and words work very well next to each other. A
1. The concept is clear and easy to understand here.
2. One might think for how long will the temperature stay the same
3. No disagreements.
4. No, it works well.
5. I think the model should hold the flask in a different way. In this picture it looks like she wants to keep it far from her.

B
1. Same here, the concept is good and simple to understand. This is probably the best advert of the ones presented.
2. Nothing comes to mind.
3. Nothing.
4. No.
5. The picture works very well. The text gives a sense of time (the day), and the picture shows that the temperature will stay no matter where you go. A
I would only change the picture here. The model should interact more with the flask, because it looks like the model is having fun while throwing the flask away.

B
Nothing to comment. To me this is the best advert of the ones proposed, the text and the pictures are a good mix, giving a sense that the flask will keep the temperature through space and time. A
1. This makes me think about everlasting refreshment. Being fresh during the whole day.
2. The idea is quite clear for me, no hidden meanings.
3. I think it transmits the idea of freshness that lasts for a long time.
4. The sentence is clear, it works well.
5. The picture works well, the model seems to be enjoying the drink.
6. I think that the picture to go with this concept should be set in a more warm environment.

B
1. For me it brings the idea of stability: no matter how you like your coffee, hot or cold, it will always be ready for you.
2. Like I've just said, it doesn't specifically say that the coffee should be hot. It means that the flask can keep the right temperature, be it hot or cold.
3. I would say 'stability' and 'readiness' are the two words that go with this idea.
4. The wording is very good.
5. The pictures is very good too. We don't know how she likes her coffee, but she's clearly enjoying it.
6. So far, this is the best advert for me. Nothing to add. A
1. I think that the concept is good, it transmits the idea of a long term refreshment.
2. Since the flask is meant to keep drinks hot or cold, the sentence can be interpreted as is the flask can only keep drinks fresh.
3. Nothing.
4. The sentence is good in my opinion. Of course it could be shortened to something like 'Everlasting refreshment', but that would be too short.
5. As I mentioned, the model seems to be wearing clothes for cold weather, something that doesn't fit the need of drinking something fresh.

B
1. In general, the concept is good.
2. People might think that the flask can only be used for coffee.
3. Nothing.
4. Like I've just said, it seems focused on coffee. Maybe 'Your drink stays the way you take it' could work, but in this case it would look very general.
5. The picture is good, nothing to add. A
The sentence is good, I wouldn't change it, but the picture doesn't transmit very well the idea. Maybe if the model stood in a more warm environment, let's say a beach, under the sun, the idea of enjoying the fresh drink would be stronger.

B
Like I've said, this seems very focused on coffee drinkers. A more general sentence could be better.
The picture is good. We don't know what she's drinking or if it's hot or cold, but she's enjoying it. I think Concepts A would be the better choice for Germany. German people are very straightforward and they like simple and clear ideas, like they like clear, simple and functional objects. That's why emphasising the fact that the temperature will be kept for a long time in the best option.
I don't mean that they wouldn't care about sustainability, like Concepts S, but that's a given for them nowadays. Things are supposed to be sustainable in general, they care about it, but if something points out that it's sustainable they would think that there's something not right about the product.
Anyway, since I'm Spanish, I would like to say that in Spain Concepts R is the best option, since we care more about sensations and feelings. So making the refreshment the centre of attention would make sense.

For me, as a Spanish person living in Germany, Concepts A would attract more my attention, so that is my choice.",Splash,
296580,Genie,Joo,geniejoo@gmail.com,"1. Only having a general idea of the brand, Hydro Flask— the adverts seem to be on brand as well as the use of words (such as sustainable) for the campaign. It did make me realize that the bottles can be used for more than just water (I usually associate reusable bottles only to be used for water).

2. Everything but “Concept A (Cold)” was interesting to me. I think in terms of hot/cold ads, everything complimented each other well expect Concept A. I think for me, it’s because despite concept S being different the overall feel of it is still similar to one another where concept A feels a little disjointed visually. But overall, I like how everything looks visually and is something I think is on-brand and not out of place.

 
3. I would like to know what color and sizes they come in if it varies. 1. 
Concept A

어디가든 똑같은 온도 (Cold)
시작했던 온도랑 하루를 마쳐 (Hot)

Concept R

하루 중일 순수하게 상쾌하다 (Cold)
커피 어디나가도 온도는 그대로 (Hot)

Concept S
이제 완변한 온도는 내구재 (Cold)
상쾌하는게 이제 내구재랑 할 수 있다 (Hot)

English is my native language but the only changes in these are just slight nuances to match the Korean language. 1. With climate change and needing sustainability now more than ever, it’s needed for us to make small changes without having to sacrifice certain luxuries we are accustomed to. So to enjoy the world and all it has to offer, we can also help it by being sustainable.

2. We can all be a bit more sustainable in the simplest ways to help the earth so we can enjoy it more! 

3. You don’t have to sacrifice what kind of drinks to bring along as well as have more types of vessels/bottles to enjoy a certain kind of drink, it’s all there in one!

4. Wording is simple enough and everything is implied well for me to understand!

5. Imagery covers two different yet similar types of environment so it helps me understand it can work in various situations. 

6. Maybe a small blurb/line saying how every bit of sustainability helps? 1. First image, bottle isn’t shown as prominently as it is on the second image. 

2. Both adverts are straightforward so no real questions come up when I see them. 

3. I don’t disagree with this necessarily but “perfect” temperature isn’t exactly specified so maybe being more specific on the idea of that. 

4. “Perfect” temp is something that could be anything— so, maybe using the word ‘all’ or ‘every’

5. I think with these two particular images it is as good as it could be. There isn’t any negative connotations. 1. Like I stated earlier, everything is straight forward and easy to identify quickly since it is minimal. My only changes would possibly be wording but imaging is good as it is. 
2. No changes to the imagery but possibly just wording to maybe:
A. Now “every” temp is sustainable or staying refreshed is sustainable. 1. No matter where or what, you’ll have the same drink you started with. You don’t have to worry about having a different drink by the end of the day. 
2. You don’t have to sacrifice what kind of drink cause of the weather or place.
3. You can take any drink with you and keep it the way it is without worry.
4. The wording on this is clear and straightforward to articulate the main idea.
5. The imagery is clear to convey the main idea.
6. Although the imagery conveys the main idea, I feel it isn't as impactful as it can be compared to the wording of the advert. 1. The first image compared to the second one isn't as strong-- second one seems more like an advert whilst the other just seems like a random social media post type of photo. 
2. No questions are raised, especially with the wording of the advert. 
3. The only thing I disagree with is the use of the first image between the two companion adverts.
4. The wording in these adverts are strong and straightforward. 
5. The imagery of the first one isn't as strong as it can be, seems a little less well put together compared to the second image. There are no negative connotations but just the overall feel between the two has a contrast that doesn't fit as well together compared to the other adverts. Between the two adverts, both have strong wording to convey the main idea of the campaign I just wish the overall vibe/feel of the two images complimented each other better. The images between the two have different feels, one seems like a social media posting (first one) whereas, the other, looks like something from an advertisement. Both could work but they would both need two different images for the other complimenting post to make it work, not these two images together. 1. All day, I can stay hydrated/refreshed consistently. Similar to a cell phone or bag, it's just another thing that can be a constant in my life to function. 
2. With one Hydro Flask, I can go along with my day quenching any thirsts I may have-- with a drink or coffee. 
3. No matter where I take it, I can have it the same way and all day. 
4. The wording with this concept is strong and straightforward and compliments the images.
5. The imagery of these adverts are the most consistent/cohesive between all of the adverts shown, I think it conveys the main idea very well!
6. I feel out of all the adverts I compared, this one is the most cohesive and well-done, the only way I can think to amplify this is maybe imaging but even then, I don't know what images could work to amplify this. 1. I like everything about this advert set. I think the concept/image/wording go well together.
2. No questions or anything when looking at both wording or images. 
3. There is nothing I disagree with. 
4. The wording on this is strong and straightforward.
5. If anything could be changed, I would think it's imaging but for me, these two are the most cohesive compared to all the other adverts that were shown. I can only think of maybe making the first image a bit more different cause it could look too similar to the second one? But between the two types of bottles shown, I still think it works well together. Once again, I like everything but if I HAD to change something, that's the only thing that comes to mind. Since the first image is a little similar to the second one, the only thing I would really change is maybe something a little wider (shot wise) since both lean towards a more close-up shot variety. But overall, these two images compliment each other and the products very well so there isn't anything I would really change. Wording and everything else is well-done, so no changes there either. Depending on demographics, there would be two that come to mind but overall, in South Korea, Concept S is the clear winner. 
South Korea tends to do more of a ""make your own adventure/wanderlust"" type of thing when it comes to hiking/traveling so showing shots of places like they do in advert/concept S is something that appeals to Koreans more than the other two.",Splash,

Hot - Changes 'You started' --> Start of your day

Cold - Changes 'Pure' --> 'Genuine'. For me, 'Genuine' or 'Real' is better to represent pure refreshment.

Cold&Hot- Translate as it is What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
--> Looks advertisement for outdoor clothing or goods. 
--> Hard to link bottle 
--> Associated pure, natural image 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
--> Can handle the bottle at any situation 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Able to keep perfect temperature all day long 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Pretty articulate. Easy to understand 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
Not really. Can't find the link between perfect temperature and nature image. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Want to add image that is easily linked with the bottle (e.g. drinking shot) What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
Can't notice what this images is for. 

What questions does it raise?
What is the connection between the image and bottle? 

What things do you disagree with? 
I can understand that the temperature is sustainable where I go even if it is deep inside of mountain. But when I see only images, it looks like ads for outdoor clothing or tourism board

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
No, Text is clear 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Not really. Image itself looks clean and refreshed Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
Adding drinking shot of the model or showing bottle bigger 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
Adding drinking shot of the model or showing bottle bigger 

Changes to the wording?
Wording is fine. But I am not sure differences between hot and cold version. Hot needs to emphasize 'warm sensation' more 

Changes to the imagery?
Adding drinking shot of the model or showing bottle bigger What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
Active, lively, good to bring for outdoor activity 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
Convenient to use. Since it emphasizes portability for active outdoor activity, it would be convenient to use 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Not really about temperature. Good to bring for active outdoor activities 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Well delivered 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
Easy and convenient to use for outdoor activity. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Can't really catch the idea about perfectly keeping original temperature What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
Message of 'keeping temperature' is not well delivered from the image 

What questions does it raise?
I am not sure which photo represents 'hot'. For me, it both looks for winter. 

What things do you disagree with? 
For second photo, the model is grabbing bottle so easily and background seems to be winter. If it is winter, the drink would probably be hot drink and it would not be easy to grab the bottle if hot drink is perfectly kept at same temperature from the start. 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
For me, temperature doesn't really matter with the place i go. 'When' rather than 'where' is more important for me. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
not really. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
Left/right : Both need to emphasize benefit of keeping temperature 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
Left: Drinking shot with water drops for showing cold temperature easily 
Right: Showing steam shot for emphasizing hot temperature 

Changes to the wording?
Left: Would be good for focusing 'when'. Temperature doesn't really matter where I go. 
Right: Like the text. 

Changes to the imagery?
Left: Drinking shot with water drops for showing cold temperature easily 
Right: Showing steam shot for emphasizing hot temperature What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.

Keeping hot temperature perfectly 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Keeping temperature so that I can feel relaxed at any time of the day 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Yes, well delivered 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
Perfectly matched with right photo. 
Not sure for left photo since the image doesn't seem to refreshment it looks more like relaxed 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Need to show refreshment image more for emphasizing 'keeping cold temperature' What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
Especially for left, doesn't really match between wording and the image 

What questions does it raise?
Not sure it offers keeping 'cold' temperature as well 

What things do you disagree with? 
Especially for left version, the time of background doesn't look being passed long time to talk about all day long 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Sounds right but it doesn't really match with the image for left one. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
No negative connotation Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
Left : Need to show 'time passing' to emphasize long preservation. Also 'refreshment' does not delivered well 
Right: Like the atmosphere. Wording and image is well matched 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
Changes to the wording?
Like both wording. 

Changes to the imagery?
Left : Showing cold image thorough raindrop or light ice on the surface of the bottle. Back ground timing looks morning time. It would be better to show background under the sun at high noon 
Right: If it shows steams in the image or grabbing bottle with both hands, hot temperature would be delivered intuitively Concept A. 

The color and the patter of the brand is pretty colorful and vivid. Lively and active images of concept A represents brand well. 
Also I felt that 'Hydro flask' targets outdoor activity from the image used on the website and composition of the products (e.g. coming with mug). 
Concept A is the one that shows outdoor activity images well among three concepts",Splash,
296577,Adriana,a Lopez Marroquin,addylmarroquin@gmail.com,"Concepts A
1.- At fist sight I had to see the images in order to understand of what they were talking about
2.- I liked the references, you can imagine how fresh or warm could be your drink in the bottle and I like too the copy for the cold version, because it gave me an idea of how many time liquids stay warm.
3.- I would like to know how much water fits in the bottle 

Concepts R
1.- My first reaction was to thing those images were boring
2.- I didn't like the images they are too simple also the copys
3.-  I want to know about time and I would like to know how much water fits in the bottle

Concepts S
1.- My first reaction was to double check the images weather vs the cold and hot copy words
2.- I did't like anything, It doesn't make any sense, why I would like a cold drink in a freezing weather and vice versa? On the other hand, copy for both are cool, because I like the use of the same word ""sustainable"" for a campaign
3.- I want to know about time and I would like to know how much water fits in the bottle Concepts A
COLD: La temperatura se mantiene a donde quiera que vayas
HOT: Termina el día con la temperatura con la cual comenzaste

Concepts R
COLD: Frescura pura todo el día
HOT: El café se mantiene de la misma manera en la que lo tomas

In some cases you have to use more words for say something in spanish, because people can be confuse.

Concepts S
COLD: Ahora la temperatura perfecta es perdurable
HOT: La frescura es perdurable

In this case I have to use a synonymous of ""sustainable"" because we don't use this word the way you do 1.- I thought that you can do any activity outdoor for a long time and keep your drinks in the perfect temperature
2.- You can understand in both cases that you can keep cold or warm your drinks
3.- The main idea is that you can keep your perfect temperature always
4.- Both wording are very clear, but the left one is my favorite. The right one has no power
5.- Both imagery are very explicitly about how long you can go with your drinks in the perfect temperatura
5.- I like the left one, I think that it has a good copy in addition with the imagery, you can imagino a long your drink could stay warm, and talk about the present, the word NOW is very strong. 1.- The concept only talk about sustainability, and I want to know more about possibilities
2.-Why only for outdoors activities
3.-I think the concept is not inclusive
4.-  The copy from the right is very impersonal
5.- Nothing bad with the imagery, but I want more possibilities, the adverts only speaks with the outdoor activities people 1.- As I said previously, I would like to see more possibilities, that they speak to a bigger audience.
2.-
A)The wording from the left is very good, bur the right one it could be more warm, I thing is not friendly. The bran has to talk with a personal touch
B) More possibilities as I said 1.- This is the concept I like more, I thought that de copy give me the change for imagine a lot of situations where are I can use my reusable bottle
2.- The concept talk about keep a long time your drinks in the temperatures you want
3.- Keep your perfect temperature for a long time
4.-Those are the best wording of the campaing
5.- The imagery are the same as the others concepts, so yes they explain the mail idea, but the brand can do more
6.- This concept is perfect, I like a lot and it said a lot with a few words, I would like to amplified this wording campaign definitely 1.- The concept only talk about outdoors activities, and I want to see more possibilities in the imagery
2.-Why only for outdoors activities
3.-Only with the outdoor thing
4.- Nothing
5.- Nothing bad with the imagery, but I want more possibilities, the adverts only speaks with the outdoor activities people 1.- With more possibilities in the imagery, not only outdoor activities, 
2.-
a)Nothing, The wording is perfect, is very positive and I thing is warm.
b)Yes, please put activities like going to workout or going for a coffee, maybe if you put an image about life working or a picnic. I thought that the bottle keep my drinks fresh and cold for a long time, I thought too that is a bottle for a journey outside
Is that the bottle has a technology that keep the drinks cold
Refreshment
Is short and direct, which is good because is very clear and you can remember it easily
The imagery is not that good, I saw the girl and I thought that she is in a cold weather, so I don't know if she want a cold drinks

I think that the bottle is an alternative to plastic vessels, for I can change the way I drink warm liquids.
You can change the plastic for a reusable vessel who has the tech for keep the drinks warm
Change plastic for reusable bottles
Is easy to understand that the copy communicate that is better to use a reusable bottle than plastic, it drives you to stop using other vessels.
She seems to be in a cold weather, so I think it's very pleasant to be drinking something warm, in a reusable vessel. She is in the woods that it means that the drink could stay warm for a long time in a bottle that don't allow liquids to spill.

I would like to see amplified the concept from the right, I think all the idea is more powerful in this case because of the combination of the copy and the imagery, the reusable idea and the tech of the bottle is super clear. The images communicates you that this bottle is only good for people who is in an outdoor activity, I think it will be better and more inclusive to see different images, like someone going to a Starbucks for a coffee with his super Hydro Flask instead to use a plastic vessel or someone going to workout with fresh water in the reusable bottle instead a plastic one.
Why only in an outside environment?
That excludes other targets
The wording is fine
I think the brand can use better references, not only for outdoor activities 1.- I will put an Imagery more inclusive, like someone going to the office, or someone going to the workout for cold concept, and for warm, someone going for a coffee or someone going for a tea 

2.-
a)I think the wording is good
b)Of course, as I said I would use images from the everyday life I would choose concept A, it's the one I feel most identified with, I like the idea of finishing the day with the same temperature, no matter where I go, this concept open a lot of possibilities and  I need more possibilities in my life, as the bran says in the website urban meets outdoors. This concept in positive, powerful, close to the people. You can combine imagery like people have fun in the beach with a beer in his reusable bottles or soda.",Splash,
296578,Mariana,Hernández Carranza,mareadah@icloud.com,"1.- My first reaction was: ""I want to go outside and stay surrounded of nature with a hot or cold drink""...
2.- The one I loved the most, was ""Concept A"" for cold drinks, the image and the message have coherence. I truly can understand that if want to get refreshment in my workout day, that bottle can keep the water cold. What I didn´t like was ""Concept R"" for cold drinks, she seem´s to be cold, her outfit determines that she is in a cold place, is not sunny, so If I were in her place I would prefer to take a hot drink, not a cold one in a cold day.
In ""Concept S"" I do prefer the bottle that has a curve for cold drinks and the other one for hot drinks and also I don´t get the message because the image is not telling me in which way ""Refreshment is sustainable"".
3.- I would like to know the bottle materials, and may be, I would like to see an infonography with the explanation of why ""Refreshment is sustainable"" if I get this bottle. 1.- CONCEPT A
Cold drink: La temperatura se mantiene, no importa a donde vayas.
Hot drink: Termina tu día con la temperatura con la que iniciaste.

CONCEPT R
Cold drink: Puro refrescamiento, todo el día.
Hot drink: Tu café se mantiene como te gusta tomarlo.

CONCEPT S
Cold drink: Ahora le temperatura perfecta es sostenible.
Hot drink: Refrescarte es sostenible.

2.- CONCEPT R
Cold drink: Puro refrescamiento, todo el día.
We don´t use the word ""refrescamiento"" , but that is the exactly translation to the spanish. So, it´s better getting the idea with: ""Refréscate todo el día"", that is like ""Refresh all day"", is more personal. 1.-  In the first picture I think in nature, a bottle, something about sustainability but I don´t get the complete message. 
2.-  Implies that I can´t understand why should I buy it.
3.- I get the main idea in the second photo, I think that if I buy the bottle I´m gonna help to combat the climate change and my drink it´s gonna stay cold.
4.- It´s simple, but the problem in the first picture is that I can´t see the bottle so, I don´t understand that you´re talking about the temperature of my drink.
5.- I think the problem is that the woman is too far away, so it´s difficult to see the bottle and understand that thanks to it, you´re gonna keep your drink with the perfect temperature.
6.- The bottle with a hot drink and the action of drinking it, and the same with the cold one. 1.- For me, what doesn´t work so well is that, in the picture everything seems to be very normal, and in the wording you´re talking about a world problem that I can´t see. So it takes a few minutes to imagine the difference that I´ll make if I buy this kind of bottle. 
2.- What kind of material the bottle is made of? What kind of temperature are you talking about, climate change? Is only available in blue or any other colors?
3.- I think in the first picture everything seems to be very confusing, because I don´t find coherence in the photo and the wording.
4.- I think wording is simple, concrete and I can get the message.
5.- I think imagery can be better, to totally understand that there is a problem that can be solved if I buy this bottle. 1.- Tal vez pondría una imagen que ejemplifique el impacto positivo y los beneficios de consumir este tipo de botellas. 
2.- I´ll like to see a photo that shows the impact in nature for using these kind of bottles, like an before and after.
a. No, I like it.
b. In the first image I´ll like to see the woman more closely and to see what she´s drinking and to get realise that her drink is hot because of the bottle she is using; that´s why even though she´s in the forest she can keep her drink warm. 1.-Going outside to workout and bring that bottle with me.
2.- The bottle may help to keep my drink to stay cold or hot.
3.- To stay refresh, no matter if it´s a sunny day or if you´re doing exterior activities, the temperature of the water it´s gonna stay cold.
4.-  On the first picture I get it inmediately, but in the second one it´s kind of confusing, I don´t understand if you´re talking about my temperature, my day or the temperature of my coffe.
5.-On the second picture, the bottle it´s too far away so it´s hard to understand you´re talking about the temperature of my coffe.
6.-  I´ll like to see the bottle more closely because she ´s too far away and it seem´s like she ´s gonna drop it at the road. 1.- The second picture doesn´t work with the main idea, because it´s not easy to understand.
2.- How many water can I take in that bottle? and on the second one, what kind of temperature are you talking about? 
3.- Just that the bottle it´s too far away.
4.- Yes, in the second photo I can´t understand you´re talking about the temperature of my coffe, I think about my corporal temperature.
5.- The first image is great, but in the second one the main idea is not transmitted. 1.- I would take a picture of her more closely, drinking a hot coffee and where the bottle is totally shown, in a winter landscape.
2.a.- Finish your coffee with the temperature you started.
2.b.- I want to see the bottle more closely and I´ll may change her corporal position because it seem´s like she wants drop the bottle. 1.-I think about going outside and get a hot drink in that bottle.
2.-The bottle will keep the temperature of my coffee for hours.
3.-The 2 different kinds of bottles will mantain your drink cold or hot. 
4 and 5.- I´m gonna answer the next question on this one too, because there´re in the same idea.  The wording it´s easy too understand, but about the first picture, it doesn´t makes me feel that I want to get refresh, it seems to be too cold. So that´s why when you see the picture the wording gets a little bit confusing.
6.- I think I'd like to see another landscape, to truly understand the wording. 1.- The climate temperature in the two landscapes chosen, are kind of different from the wording you want me to understand.
2.- First of all, how many hours the coffe can stay hot in that bottle? Can I take my spresso there or the bottle is too big?
3.- I think about a hot drink when I see the first picture, the climate temperature, the way she´s dressed, I mean it´s too cold outside, right? I don't want cold water.
4.- It´s simple and convincent.
5.-  On the second picture I think I´ll like to see more the bottle. 1.- For cold drinks, I prefer to see someone who is on a sunny day at the beach, running or doing some kind of workout.
2.-  a) I like the wording, as I said is simple and easy to understand.
       b) I´ll like to change the landscape or the way she is dressed. I´ll choose the Concept A for cold drinks, the wording is easy to understand and have coincidence with the imagery. In the image I can totally see the bottle design and the must importante thing is that I can visualize myself doing the same, like the girl in the photo.",Splash,ENFP

R: Simple but not simplistic. The claims and the pictures are quite straightforward.
S: Well, the two pictures are labelled wrong (hot and cold are mixed). Other than that, the claims and the pictures are quite straightforward: the brand pretends to be sustainable. It's not about hot or cold drinks anymore.
• Like/don't like
A: I get the point, and feel like the ""hot"" and the ""cold"" versions are self-explanatory. Yet the hippie girl in the van should wear gloves and warm clothes if you want to convey the idea of a bottle that keeps things warm in a cold environment. And I don't relate to those girls myself.
R: The girl is the ""cold version"" shouldn't wear an insulated jacket: she must feel ""hot"" if she wants a refreshing drink. If she just finished a jogging session, she wouldn't have been running out with a down jacket: you can't wash these so you don't want to sweat in them.
S: Will the French relate to these pictures?
• ""know more""
A: This is supposed to be an inspirational version of the ad, but the ""message"" of the ads is quite ""empty"" to me.
R: This is a descriptive version of the ad. It feels like HydroFlasks does the job. Nothing else to explore.
S: I'd like to know how ""sustainable"" the brand is. In French (my native language):
A. COLD: Toujours à la bonne température. Partout et tout le temps. (""The right temperature. Everywhere, anytime"")
A. HOT: Toujours chaud, du matin au soir. (""Chaud"" means ""warm"", ""hot""; and is also a popular expression for ""into it""; so this translation would mean ""Always into it, from morning to night"". It would be appropriate for peoplebelow 40 y.o. but is not insulting to the others, they just wouldn't get the double meaning of it).
R. COLD: Votre bouffée de fraicheur, tout au long de la journée. 
R. HOT: Le café que vous aimez reste le café que vous aimez. (""The coffee you love remains the coffee you love""; the meaning would be that it stays at the right temperature and the right taste, even though is it stored in a jar)
S. COLD (after correction): Durablement rafraîchi. (the sentence's subject is now either the man on the picture or his drink) or better yet: ""La vague de frais est là pour durer"" (a sentence that a forecast host would use to say that a fresher temperature is here to stay, for good).
S. HOT (after correction): Maintenez vous durablement au chaud. (Keep yourselves warm sustainably) • Thoughts and associations
HOT: Sustainability; outdoor activity; for nature lovers; is having snow in a ""seemingly hot canyon"" a good thing?; is the brand really sustainable?
COLD: ""Durable"" or ""sustainable""?; for nature lovers; Something to enjoy ""on your own"" 
• What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
HOT: The beverage will stay warm. We (Humans) messed up with the weather.
COLD: The beverage will stay cold. We (Humans) messed up with the weather.
• What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
It's a play on word on ""sustainable""; the word should be ""durable"" but ""sustainable"" is more thought-provoking.
• How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Pretty well. But it introduces the fact that the brand should be sustainable itself.
• How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
For the HOT one, the feeling is mixed, since the scene is actually quite desperate. The other one works well.
• Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
The fact that the brand should be sustainable. For real. And the ""Let's go!"" catchphrase… should go. • What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
HOT: The image conveys a feeling of despair.
• What questions does it raise?
HOT and COLD: Is the brand sustainable?
• What things do you disagree with?
HOT and COLD: The catchphrase for HydroFlask!
• Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
No.
• What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
HOT: The image conveys a feeling of despair. One real challenge: Make sure HydroFlask is a sustainable brand.

Actions to take:
1. Core actions: make HydroFlask a sustainable brand. (I let you devise what to make with this: Consume less. Sell less. Source organic and env. friendly materials. Treat people well. Commit to sharing benefits. Etc, etc. :) )
2. Smaller actions:
• The tagline needs a change. Something with ""life"" or ""distance"" (like ""For the distance"" for example) 
• Colors and materials of the products could maybe be changed as well.
• The idea would be that buying the products would contribute to something big, beyond being useful everyday for everyone. • What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
COLD: Simplistic. ""Easy"". No discovery. I do not relate to this person.
HOT: The sentence is unclear; What's the product about?; The girl is not cold and wears no gloves, she should be cold; Is the day finishing or starting?
• What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
BOTH: Temperature inside the ""flask"" remains constant: the bottles are insulated.
• What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
BOTH: Live free, your flask will be your companion throughout the day. ""The flask gives you more freedom"". This concept is about ""inspiring"" people. 
• How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
At least it doesn't say ""be happy with the flask"" ;)
• How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
I think the images are way to simplistic. Going out with a flask and taking a selfie doesn't seem cool to me; Going on a road trip with an old van is too cliché. 
• Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why? • What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept?
It seems plain. It could be an ad for anything, from a pair of socks to an insurance company.
• What questions does it raise?
""Do I relate to these girls?""
• What things do you disagree with?
The pictures should bear a stronger message.
• Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Is not empowering.
• What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
The picture should bear a stronger message. I would change the images and the texts. If the goal for this concept is to make people believe that they will do ""cool/hip things"" if they own a couple of flasks, then maybe it should be done with a funny tone: for the ""warm"" canister, it could be about someone who finds herself in a cold environment and doesn't have proper equipment, except for the flask. And the opposite could work, too. • What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
COLD: The sentence is clear; The woman must be cold; why does she need a refreshing beverage? ; What's in the bottle?
HOT: The sentence is clear; The woman must be cold; she needs and enjoys (sun ray) the moment
• What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
The bottles keep the temperature.
• What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Practicality. The bottles give you moments of pleasures every day, every time.
• How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Very well to me.
• How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
Not well for the COLD one (even though Patagonia must be a brand that HydroFlask customers relate to)
• Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
A better picture for the COLD one. • What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept?
The picture for the COLD one.
• What questions does it raise?
For both: Since these ads are aimed at practical people (like me): do I have any proof that HydroFlask delivers?
• What things do you disagree with?
The clothings for the COLD one.
• Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Nope :)
• What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
The clothings for the COLD one are wrong. What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
I would change the picture for the COLD ad: There should be sun; the girl should look like she just had practiced; There should be no wind in her hair; etc. Other than that I think these ads are OK. (I live in Paris)
Concepts R for urban dwellers (for print ads), with a new picture for the COLD one; Concepts S for outdoor enthousiasts (for print ads) as well. With other pictures.
For web ads, they should be reworked to be animated. Images should be redone for concepts. Concepts A are too simplistic.",Splash,
230603,Susan,Schell,susankristinaschell@gmail.com,"Concepts A:
1. My initial reaction was that many of these have awkward phrasing and I don't like when the word ""temperature"" is shortened to just ""temp."" I find the cold concepts' imagery a bit more believable and real. The hot concepts' images look more wanderlust-y in a cheesy/posed way. 
2. I like the image with the woman taking a ""selfie"" in the cold ""A"" concept - it looks genuine and natural, she seems like she would be a real customer. I don't like the phrase with it, it is clunky and not catchy. I am also confused about why the products change in Concept S - it looks like the bottles are switched for hot and cold, like the concept changes from the drinks being cold or hot to the environment being cold or hot. I think it is stronger when the emphasis is on the drinks being cold or hot.  
3. I would like to know more about the blue product on a blue background choice - I don't find it very compelling and I think the product is a bit lost. I think the pop of blue in the photos is nice and that it connects to product in a strong way, but I found myself not looking at the product picture, I was focusing on the images on the right side. It just seems very traditional and like the product could be shot is more modern or even ""real"" way to match the images better.  1. This makes me think about sustainability - I know it is talking more about keeping the drink warm or cold all day, but it makes me wonder if the product is made in a sustainable way or if the company prioritizes sustainability. 
2. Using a buzzer word like ""sustainable"" coupled with images that are clearly emphasizing nature/travel, it suggests an eco-friendly lifestyle/brand. 
3. I think the concept is about the temperature control, it uses the word ""sustainable"" to mean that the temperature is maintained.
4. The wording in these two adverts work for me. Except temperature should just be written out completely. The phasing here expresses the concept and  ""refreshment is sustainable"" is a bolder, more exciting statement. 
5. The first image doesn't convey the idea because I can barely see the product. I like that it isn't showing off the product obnoxiously, but I really can hardly see the bottle. The second image is more basic but I think it stays true to the branding and the ideals of the target customers. 
6. I feel that the product images (blue) aren't helping to convey the message or differentiate this brand from others. It doesn't look like there is a narrative or strong concept behind the other images - they are fairly generic travel/backpacker images juxtaposed with a very blue product shot. I think the main idea could have more of a story behind it and that story could be better expressed throughout all the communication. 1. I think the concept lacks originality - every reusable water bottle company emphasizes that they are better than plastic bottles or that if they have temperature control that keeps your drink whatever temperature you want all day long. I don't think this campaign is saying anything that stands out from competitors and the ""lifestyle"" is mostly showing clichés of traveling and adventure. 
2. This makes me question who their target audience is for these ads - these ads feel very open and maybe inspired by Lonely Planet or like a travel company more than a cool bottle company. 
3. I strongly disagree with the product shot, it looks dated and doesn't present the product in an exciting way. I think the images could say more and should maybe be more focused on the users' everyday life - not just fantastic adventures that look like Instagram pictures.
4. Again, I don't like ""temp"" being used instead of ""temperature."" I also think that saying ""now"" is unnecessary and that it could just be ""The perfect temperature is sustainable."" 
5. The first image is not clear enough - the product is not visible enough, I do think the contrast of orange and blue is compelling but the lack of product in the picture doesn't make sense to me. The second looks a little too much like an Instagram travel blog post; however, I do think it has the right amount of visibility of the product - it is subtle but definitely noticeable. 1. I would want to re-do the product shots and do something with more contrast and something that was bit more visually striking. 

2. I feel like the first image is a bit stronger - despite the lack of product visibility, so I would want to re-shoot that and have the bottle be a bit more noticeable. I like the pop of color in each photo corresponding to the product picture, it is a nice touch.

3. I think the imagery could be a bit more ""real,"" I found some of the images from the other concepts more convincing and like they looked like actual customers participating in the campaign.  

4. For the wording, my only real issue is ""temp"" being used instead of ""temperature."" I also think that saying ""now"" is unnecessary and that it could just be ""The perfect temperature is sustainable."" I do think that the images don't really reflect sustainability to me but I do think they are solid lifestyle shots that might connect with adventurous customers. 

5. The first image, while very pretty is not focused on the product enough. I do think the contrast of orange and blue is striking but the lack of product in the picture is kind of a shame. The second looks a little too posed; however, I do think it has the right amount of visibility of the product, I would change this image to something that is a bit more natural like the first one. I like the first image, the product is very clear and the girl looks like a real, relatable customer. The second image with the girl hanging out of the truck, looks a bit forced and again ""wanderlust-y.""
I think the campaign is about time passing and the beverages staying the same temperature - going on a hike or car trip and having the drink stay the same temperature all day. 
The concept is about bringing your bottle with you wherever you might go and having whatever liquid is inside maintain its temperature. 
Both of the sentances relate to the images/concepts, they imply that you can go wherever and you beverage will maintain its temperature. I think it relates to main idea but it is a little clunky with the wording. 
I like the main idea being really about the customer and about them taking their bottle wherever they are going - the first image captures this feeling for me and I think it is the strongest. 1. I find the second photo less convincing, it is too over-the-top and feels very staged. The product looks unnatural
2. I think for me it is interesting that there is no mention of how long lasting the temperature control is...the wording suggests that it last a long time but we are not given details in the ads.
3. I disagree with the second photo and think that something a bit less posed (like the first one) is more attractive and emphasizes the real lifestyle of the brand. 
4. ""Finish the day with the temperature you started"" sounds awkward to me - I feel like it is missing the word ""with"" at the end but I don't really like that either. I think the phrases could be catchier. ""The temperature stays while you go"" maybe is a bit less wordy. 
5. My only negative association here is with the car picture - it looks a bit phony, fake ""free-spirited,"" and Instagram-y to me. I really strongly think that the realness of the ""selfie"" style photo could be a cool campaign - it could be like the story of following your customers on their own documented adventures. Like if the second image was a selfie in the car with a group of people traveling and one is holding the hot bottle, that might be a more realistic version of this image. The more posed pictures feel very artificial and like they came from Pinterest or Instagram. I can't see myself hanging out of car with my coffee in a bottle but maybe I would be in that car with my friends on a trip, I think there is a lack of connection to this current image. 

I also think that wording could be tighter - ""The temperature stays, while you go."" or ""The temperature stays, you go."" or ""You go, the temperature stays."" 

The second phrase is trickier - maybe it could be something like ""Finish the day how you started."" I just find it slightly strange to say ""Finish the day with the temperature you started,"" it isn't the clearest and I had to re-read it a few times. It feels a bit ambiguous, like it could be about temperature control clothing or something else, I feel that it is less connected to the bottle. 1. These remind me of many beverage advertisements - like Coca-Cola or some soda drink. I think I have this assosiation because the woman is actively drinking from the bottles in both pictures. 
2. I don't really feel like it implies much, other than drinking. Maybe because the model is wearing a Patagonia vest in the first one it implies that water bottles are a bit more expensive than standard reusable bottles. 
3. This campaign seems more focused on the beverages, it is about hydration or having your coffee stay warm all morning. I don't feel much background story here. 
4. The wording is ok, it seems less connected to the idea of temperature control but I think it is still clear. Playing on ""how do you take your coffee"" seems a little awkward and I think it could be more natural. 
5. I think the imagery is also just ok, it doesn't jump out at me but I also don't get caught up on it in anyway. 
6. Both of these images lack environment, I think if they had a bit more context, they could be stronger images. 1. I think it doesn't help this concept that the imagery is so focused on the woman drinking. There is very little information about her environment or what she is doing in these images, we just see her taking a sip but don't know what she is doing or where she is going.  
2. This images make me question more what is inside the bottle, rather than the bottle itself. Because it seems so much about her drinking, it makes me curious what she is drinking. 
3. I feel fairly neutral towards these, I don't think I disagree with anything except that I am focusing less on the bottles here and thinking more about the beverages inside the bottles. 
4. ""Coffee stays the way you take it"" sounds a little funny or forced to me. Maybe something like ""Coffee stays the way it should"" is a bit more natural. 
5. I don't think the images are as good as they could be but I also don't find them to be bad. I do think more background in both could set the scene a little better and emphasize that she is taking her bottle somewhere and the temperature of the beverage is maintained for that journey. It just lacks storytelling and details. I would want to create more of a background for this woman - like in the first picture I would want to see more of the stairs she is walking up and the ocean in the background. I want it to have context so it is more clear that she is doing something and going somewhere. The second image seems way too close up, it again lacks background, and worst of all the product is hidden by her hand. If she was holding the bottle with the other hand it would be more clear and still look natural. But I would want to show where she is in this image as well, like maybe she is in a park having her morning coffee. The current image doesn't let you project much onto it other than she is just drinking coffee. 

""Pure refreshment all day long"" could maybe be ""Cool refreshment all day long"" to emphasize the temperature control. I'm not totally convinced that ""Pure"" is the best word - it makes me think that maybe this bottle is about water filtering more than temperature control. ""Coffee stays the way you take it"" is also just a bit off to me but I'm not sure how to improve it. For France I would choose Concept A. I think the French would respond to the authenticity of the first (cold) image. It is fun and free but not too serious or staged. I could see these as metro-advertisements and like they would fit in within the aesthetic of ads that are currently up here. I wouldn't show the second (hot) image in France because I think the people here can be quite critical and would instantly think that this looked fake, or too posed, or too glorifying of the wanderlust traveler type.",Splash,ESFP
296588,Asa ,Skogstrom,askogstrom@gmail.com,"I find the blue product on the blue background a bit flat (i.e. the product doesn't stand out from the background). The logo looks reminds me of kids' product logos (i.e. too playful makes it a bit childish). I like the use of 'sustainable' with the product. 
A) I don't think the copy on the 'hot' version makes sense. Who knows what temperature my day started? I also don't think it's good to portray someone hanging out a moving vehicle (unsafe - big issue in Sweden)
R) I prefer this concept. It's showing what the product's usage is for in different scenarios; sporty and casual. I would like to know more about how the product stays fresh even though it may contain different type of drinks. If it can hold both coffee and water, I don't want the water to taste of coffee for example. I would also like to know more about the products functions such as weight, material, the top for drinking.  
S) Find it difficult to relate to images. I like that the hot image has the product in the image A) Cold: 'Temperaturen förblir densamma oavsett vart du går'. Hot: 'Avsluta dagen med samma temperatur som du startade den'. 
R) Cold: 'Förfriskning hela dagen lång' (removed 'pure' because it doesn't work in Swedish). Hot: 'Kaffe håller värmen så som du vill ha det' (the coffee remain warm just as you want it). 
S) Cold: 'Nu är den perfekta temperaturen hållbar'. Hot: 'Förfriskning är hållbar'. The product is ideal for hiking. 
The product is enduring (e.g. can take some hit).
It's targeting outdoor sporty people who know it's important to dehydrate.
Sustainable is close description of the main concept idea. 
Imagery of people doing outdoor hikes.
I would like to see some further info about the product; like weight, material etc. to enhance its usage for hikes. I can't relate to the locations. It's too different to what I'm used to. 
Perhaps it's usage is not for me and what I need where I live and go for hikes. 
I find the logo different to relate to. It reminds me very much of something that would be on kids' products. 
'Perfect' - difficult to achieve (what does it mean anyway? perfectly hot? perfectly cold? unclear).
I would prefer local locations I recognise. I like the product sitting in the backpack. I would:
- use images from local places - something people recognise and can relate to 
- use images with more than one person as an option (hike is fun with someone too)
- show product features and change the backgroud from blue to something that makes the product 'pop' more 
- change the wording and remove the word 'perfect' but keep 'sustainable'
- revise copy to reflect that this is a product to bring with on adventures and that it can hold both cold and hot beverages It's a product easy to bring on excursions.
It's for a younger audience - free spirits. 
Portable and easy to bring with you no matter where you go. 
I think the cold version does reflect it but not the warm version.
I think it does a good job communicating carefree you spirits. 
I don't think the copy for the warm version is conveying a strong message. Who knows what temperature my day started at? It doesn't inspire me. 
The usage of the product. What is it for? Is it appropriate for trips or is it just another product that can hold my beverage. 
I don't think the message is strong.
'Finish the day with the temperature you started' - I struggle to see what it tries to communicate. Is it trying to convey that the beverage has stayed the same temperature throughout the day? 
The image for the cold version is fun, looks like she's taking a selfie but the image used in the warm ad would not work well here as it could be considered encouraging people to lean out of moving vehicles (safety is very important here). I would:
- revise the background for the product to make it 'pop' more and add some product specs
- change copy to be more light and playful to fit better with the imagery (used in cold ad)
- change copy and image for the warm ad to reflect something fun but safe and make it more relatable to the cold ad Product is for use when doing outdoor activities as well as casual use. 
Enhance that there are different ways to drink from it. 
To be used in different scenarios - trustable companion on the go.
I think the wording compliments the image well. The copy in the cold ad, also hints as it being a product with you throughout the day (reminder to refill). 
I think the image communicate the main idea well (different locations/scenarios as well as trust/content). 
Perhaps a bit more of the environment to show more of the location. I don't think that the eyes need to be shut on both images. 
How it keeps the drink fresh and/or warm (e.g. function). 
I would emphasise if the product is keeping the drink warm or cold. 
I am unsure about the word 'pure' or 'the way you take it' - when translated it's difficult to communicate the intention of the copy.
I would like to see more of the location the images are from to emphasise that they're outdoor on a hike/excursion. I would:
- give the image more space to make it clear these people are outdoor somewhere (maybe hiking or in a park) 
- reduce the product real estate in the add and add product features
- use a different background colour to make the product stand out better
- have open eyes on the person drinking cold beverage
- change the wording and remove 'pure' and 'stays the way you take it' and use warm or cold to compliment feeling of the image Concept R
It communicate feeling and product usage as well as being adapted to showcase different locations for a wider audience; for hiking (more towards sport) or in  parks (causal, out an about). 
I would also showcase that there are different colours available to choose from.",Splash,

A: I immediately can tell the product's main selling point
R: I can't tell what the product is about
S: Interesting

2.
A: It's straight forward and safe, but it's boring. The Hot one has the potential to develop further.
R: There are interesting ideas but it's difficult to catch
S: I like this one the most out of the 3 concepts, but it feels weird to me when Hot is related to refreshment (unless it's coffee)

3. How the product will fit in or add values to my lifestyle Concepts A
COLD: Giữ nhiệt dù bạn đi đến nơi đâu
HOT: Kết thúc một ngày dài với nhiệt độ mà bạn bắt đầu 

The COLD one stays pretty much the same but the HOT one I say ""Finish the long day"" instead of ""Finish the day""  because it flows better when saying in Vietnamese

Concepts R
COLD: Sảng khoái suốt ngày dài
HOT: Giữ cà phê theo cách của bạn 

In my language we don't have words that describe ""pure refreshment"" well so it's just ""refreshment"" when I translated it. For the HOT one if I translated it words by words it would sound weird in my language since the vocabulary here is unique in English so my translation can be understood as ""Keep coffee the way you want it"".

Concepts S
COLD: Nhiệt độ hoàn hảo được bảo toàn
HOT: Lưu giữ sự sảng khoái 

Vocabulary and meaning are mostly the same. 1. The product is useful for backpackers or sport lovers who love outdoor activities and traveling
2. ""Perfect Temp"" may be too abstract for some people because I think people don't usually think about the ""Perfect Temp"" concept
3. Keep your favorite drinks at the right temperature everywhere you go
4. I think the wording conveys the main idea well, however I prefer ""refreshment is sustainable"" because it shows why keeping drinks at the right temperature matters (emotion)
5. I see people going to places bring the bottle with them, which shows that the product is suitable traveling lifestyle. The imagery conveys the main idea well.
6. I want to emphasize more on why keeping drinks at the right temperature will make one's journey more enjoyable (why does it matter to keep the right temperature?) 1. From what I see, this concept focuses on one lifestyle, while the product has the potential to reach more audiences with different lifestyles. It also doesn't differentiate  the product from other products with the same function.
2. Why does keeping the right temperature matter?
3. I don't have anything that I disagree with
4. ""Now the perfect temp is sustainable"" doesn't sound right to me. I get the point is to emphasize on ""perfect temp"" but it's long and a little bit awkward
5. As I mentioned above, the imagery gives off the impression that the product is aiming for only one lifestyle and a certain type of people, if that's what the idea is about the imagery has served the purpose well; however if it's not we need more variations 1. In order to differentiate the product from others, I think the brand messaging should be more specific about how it's not only about the product but also about the lifestyle that the product serves (for example, you don't just keep the drink cold, you keep it cold with ""style""). The emotional fulfillment of drinking at the perfect temperature is also an important aspect that needs to be amplified more.

2. In my opinion the imagery is good as it is, it's the wording that needs improvement 1. Traveling, hanging out with friends, a product that's good for picnic or hiking with friends
2. You can use the product anytime and anywhere
3. Enjoying your time outside while enjoying your drink at the temperature you choose anytime and anywhere
4. The wording of the left one is straight forward, I understand that the product is something you can carry with you anywhere. I like the contrast between ""finish"" and ""start"" of the right one, I can imagine how the product accompanies one all day long. 
5. I see people enjoying themselves and sharing the joy with others. The main idea is about enjoying oneself so I think the imagery conveys the main idea well.
6. I want to know more about how the product makes life more enjoyable anytime and anywhere 1. The wording doesn't work well for me. The left one is safe but boring, the right one is too long and its wording doesn't serve the idea behind it well.
2. Why does keeping drink at one temperature matter?
3. I don't have anything that I disagree with 
4. ""Finish the day with the temperature you started"" has a great concept but I would like to see more, something catchier and more condensed 
5. If the main idea is about enjoyment, I would like to see images of people sharing great moments together, such as going on a picnic with friends or family 1. A slogan like ""have a break, have a KitKat"" (KitKat's slogan) or ""Along the Highway to Anywhere"" (Coca Cola's slogan 1949) would be more suitable for the brand as the product in my opinion is aiming for modern lifestyle.  Emphasizing more on how the product will make one's life more enjoyable is another way to strengthen the image of the product

2. If it's about enjoying life, I would like to see people sharing enjoyment with each other. As for the wording, I would like to see something catchier and more condensed. 1. A morning jogging before work, coffee to keep you productive at work, sport activities 
2. The product keeps the drink's temperature for a long time
3. The product is something you can keep with you all day, regardless what activities you do and where you are
4. From the wording I can tell that the product keeps temperature for a long time
5. I see one person doing different activities but drinking from the same bottle, it show how the product can be used for various occasions
6. How the product becomes a part of one's lifestyle 1. Though the main idea is about how the bottle can be used in different life situations, there are not much different between the 2 photos
2. What about people who don't drink coffee?
3. I don't have anything that I disagree with
4. ""...stays the way you take it"" doesn't sound right to me
5. Though I don't have problem with the imagery, the difference between the 2 activities is quite vague and I can't tell that the drink on the right is coffee since the bottle isn't transparent 1. I think it would be nice if the environment  and activities of each photo are totally different (climbing a mountain vs sitting at the office) to depict how the product fits in different situations of one's life because audience can't see the drink inside the bottle so they have very little information about the difference between the 2 activities.  May be instead of ""...the way you take it"", ""...the way you like it"" or ""Stay the way you love"" would be better for the tagline.

2. Regarding the imagery I want to see more variation of activities. The wording is not bad but it doesn't feel fully developed to me. I'm living in Tokyo, Japan. I would choose Concepts R to advertise in Japan.

Concepts R shows how the product fits in one's life which can latter be developed to a selling point in Japanese market. A product that is simple, functional, convenient for daily use and has a hint of self-expression is preferred here in Japan, especially in big city like Tokyo.

In Japan most people spend more time working at the office and they only go hiking or camping on special occasions such as national holidays, which is the reason why Concepts S isn't suitable for advertising in Japan. In case of Concepts A, though it's not a bad, it's the common image used by many companies when it comes to product like portable bottles.",Splash,
296584,Jiyoung,Lee,jiyounggeorgia@gmail.com,"1. I don't like Cold of Concepts A because I can never get my drink as cold as I'd like it to when I make it at home. Hot of Concepts A is good as I can always make boiling water at home.

Hot of Concepts R is the best. It reminds me of taking a hot coffee from my favourite cafe. 1. 어딜 가든 온도는 그대로
2. 시작한 온도로 하루를 끝내세요
3. 하루 종일 상쾌함 그 자체
4. 주문 나온 커피는 그대로 지속된다
5. 이제는 완벽한 온도가 지속 가능하다
6. 지속 가능한 상쾌함 First ad

1- gets me to wonder: what is the perfect temperature?

2 - whether hiking in cold or warm temperatures, the temperature of the drink wjll be perfect.

3 - to get the consumer to fantasize about the perfect temperature.

4 - It is good

5 - not so well.

6 - maybe change the image a little because I think there must be more impactful, better images alluding to a situation in which the perfect temperature is needed than this one


Second ad

1  - Nature. Sustainable energy. Eco-friendly.

2 - that the business is eco-friendly

3 - An eco-friendly tumbler that is useful in outdoor activities

4 - Not very well because it doesn't say that this particular flask is what makes the refreshment sustainable. It just says that refreshment is sustainable with no link to this particular flask.

5 - The woman doesn't look like she needs sustainable refreshment. She looks like she needs a hug.

6 - Maybe change the wording to link it to the flask and change the picture to a more active one. First ad

1. The matching of the wording and the image is questionable

2. What IS the perfect temperature?

3  To be fair when you are hiking you don't need a perfect temp. You just need water. 

4. ""The perfect temperature""

5. Maybe change the image to one more desperate in need for water or the perfect temperature. Or something more active.

Second ad 

1. Both the wording and the image are a bit strange even individually

2. So why should i buy this flask?

3.

4. Link it to the flask

5. The woman looks unenergetic :( maybe she should be standing up. First ad - The wording is okay but change the image to one more impactful such as one where the woman is in an extremely cold temperature yet the drink from her flask is still smoking hot. Also she has to look much more active to fit the phrase ""Let's Go!""

Second ad - change the wording to ""Sustainable refreshment"" and the image to the woman jumping or looking at the scenery with the flask in her hand First concept

1. Looks fun and optimistic

2. The flask is for cold drinks in hot weather

3. This flask can keep your drink cool even in hot weather.

4. Well

5. Well

6. Change to the wording to something for cool drinks in hot weather or change to the image to something where the environment or climate is more extreme

Second 

1. The woman looks like she might fall out of the car

2. The flask is for hot drinks in cold mountains

3. You can go camping or hiking in winter with this flask and it will keep your drink warm

4. Well

5. The woman does not look like her clothes are suitable for cold weather. She needs warmer clothes

6. Change the woman to wear hiking clothes suitable for winter First 

1. I guess there should me more sun in the picture

2. How cold will the flask stay?

3. The weather in the image doesn't look that hot. It needs to be more unpleasantly hot

4.  ""No matter where"" does not quite fit the image

5. It needs to be hotter weather. The woman looks like she's about to drop the flask

Second

1. The image

2. Why is she wearing so little when it's snowing? And why is she dangling from the car

3. Image is not suitable

4. Wording is fine

5. First - alter the image to unpleasant weather, extreme conditions to fit ""no matter where you go"". Maybe a desert or a humid city in summer

Second - the wording suits the mountain hiking or national park imagery because those events take a whole day. But the clothes of the woman need to be warmer and of more layers if you want to imply that the drink will stay hot in cold weather First

1. I like this ad
2. She is hiking or running?
3. This flask is good for outdoor activities that take up a whole day at the least
4. Good
5. Good
6. Nothing

Second

1. Somehow I don't imagine coffee to be in the flask
2. The woman likes coffee...
3. The flask sustains drinks fresh
4. Good
5. The image doesn't necessarily have to be an outdoors one.
6. Maybe change the image First 

1. It's fine
2. What is she doing all day long?
3. Nothing
4. Nope
5. Nope

Second

1. Not really
2. Where is she?
3. I think the image can be changed to an office worker at 5pm drinking the same fresh coffee
4. No
5. It seems as if she's taken the coffee just now because of the brightness of the picture The first one is fine.
The second one - the image maybe should change to something that implies coffee that stays fresh even after a long time. It could be a night setting or an indoors setting. Also, the blue flask and the blue background do not really go with the imagery of coffee. Concepts R. South Koreans are not very interested in outdoor activities. We like pretty things and indoor activities. So the coffee idea is the most suitable for us unlike European backpackers who like to go camping and hiking.",Splash,
296586,Liv,Havander,livhavander@gmail.com,"A: My initial reaction is that the second picture is not very authentic. Also, it makes little sense why anyone would lean out of a window like that. The slogan of the first picture is pretty basic but you still get the point. The slogan of the second picture is very good! It is catchy, makes sense and is short and easy for anyone to understand. The first picture goes well together with the slogan, it is a nice picture and I got inspired and happy seeing it.

R: Pretty boring slogan to the first picture. Does not really tell me anything about the product. First picture pretty boring as well. Second picture is also quite boring and doesn't tell me so much, although the lightning is nice and generally a better picture than the first one. I like the slogan to the first picture, it is catchy and well thought through. It tells me that the coffee will stay the same as if I would just have prepared it.

S: I didn't really understand the first slogan at first, I had to repeat it a couple of times. I think it was because the picture doesn't really correspond with the slogan. Although, I like it after a while since it links to a sustainable environment and it makes me want to know how/why this bottle is sustainable. I think the second slogan is a bit too short, it gives to little information. Although I love the picture. A: ""Samma temperatur var du än är"" and ""Avsluta dagen med samma temperatur som du startade"". What differs is that in the first slogan it makes more sense to say ""where ever you are"" in Swedish (directly translated). 

R: ""Ren och skär förfriskning hela dagen lång"" and ""Kaffet håller sig som du föredrar det"". What differs in the translation is that you would not really use the word ""pure"" in Swedish, so it rather translates into an expression that is ""ren och skär"". Also, the second slogan translates into ""coffee stays the way you prefer it"" if I were to direct translate what I've written to English. 

S: ""Nu är den perfekta temperaturen hållbar"" and ""Förfriskning är hållbart"". There are no variations. 1. I initially associate the word ""sustainable"" with the climate and environment. I wonder spontaneously what is in the bottle and what is the ""the perfect temp"" (which I assume is part of the idea, that it is up to the person themselves to decide).
2. That the bottle is both environmental friendly and it bottle keeps the temperature of the beverage stable. 
3. You can have one bottle for all occasions and all drinks that will contribute to a sustainable development. 
4. I like it a lot, especially the more times I read it. The word ""now"" makes me curious to now what this new product is about and how it contributes to sustainability. 
5. The contrast between the white and orange it catches your eye. Although, I don't really see the connection between the image and sustainability. On the other hand, I see how if you have a warm drink in the bottle it will stay warm (sustainable) when it is cold outside. 

1. Just reading the sentence itself it makes no sense. When looking from the perspective of that the bottle contains refreshment and that the bottle is environmental friendly it makes more sense, but that is not obvious. 
2. That the bottle is sustainable/environmental friendly.
3. If you keep your refreshment, no matter what it is, in this bottle, you will contribute to a sustainable society. 
4. I think the wording is too poor.
5. Not very well, I see no clear connection 1. The image and together with the slogan. 
2. ""why is it now sustainable?"", ""what is the perfect temp?""
3. I think that the image needs to in a clearer way emphasis sustainability. 
4. No, I like it.
5. As said, I think that the imagery should be in a different setting. Maybe in Antartica or somewhere similar where the weather conditions are the same but where you clearly see the ice melting/polar beers not finding food and therefore why this bottle is important. This will emphasis the connection to that the bottle is environmental friendly. 

1. I don't think the slogan gives me enough information about the product. 
2. ""why is refreshment sustainable?"", ""what do they mean?"", ""why would all refreshment be sustainable?"" 
3. I don't think it is possible to state that ""refreshment"" is sustainable, since it to me refers to all refreshment there is.
4. Yes, I think the entire sentence needs to be rephrased and made longer. It does not make any sense to me that refreshment is sustainable. Although, I think that what is trying to be said is that all refreshment that is poured into the bottle will be sustainable since you won't go buy a new plastic bottle all the time, but if this is the case then it is not being conveyed enough. If you put a ""now"" in there it would make more sense. 
5. I think that the imagery once again does not completely agree with the wording. I would make changes to the imagery so that it relates more to the climate changes we are currently being faced with, so that it becomes more clear why we need this sustainable bottle. As said before, maybe have imagery in Antarctica or similar to emphasis both the cold, where you would crave a perfectly hot drink, and our climate changes. 

To the second concept, I would make the sentence into ""Refreshment is now sustainable "" or ""The Hydro Flask just made refreshments sustainable"", which would make more sense to me. Then you understand that with this new bottle, all refreshments being poured into it will contribute to less unsustainable choices  of bottles. I would once again change the imagery to something that connects even more to the concept of sustainability. Maybe an image being out in the rainforest that is, to most people, known to be under a climate threat. It is still warm there and you would crave a cold drink that keeps cold during the day, but the location and setting would associate more to sustainability and climate change. 1.  I think the girl is out for a hike.
2. That she is going/traveling a long way fromt where she started. 
3. That the bottle keeps the temperature of the beverage inside it for a very long time, no matter what outer circumstances it is being faced with.
4. It is very simple and easy to understand the slogan therefore the wording is good. It could be even more advanced/catchy. 
5. The image is very good. It reflects various weather conditions and the girl is wearing active wear which must mean that she is moving during the day and will need to stay hydrated. 
6. I think the slogan can be a bit more advanced. 

1. The girl is on a roadtrip. 
2. Maybe that the temperature is not only the temperature of the beverage in the bottle but also her mood. 
3. That the temperature of the beverage in the bottle stays the same during the entire day. 
4. Very well, I think that the sentence is short and powerful. 
5. Not very well. I get the idea that it is cold and snowy outside and that the girl is possibly on a roadtrip and therefore will change location (start-finish). Although, it looks like a typical tumblr-picture. I think the general idea of the imagery should be kept although with a different more authentic shot.
6. Another shot that is more lifelike. 1. I think the sentence is a little bit too simple.
2. No questions, it is very clear what it is trying to say. 
3. Nothing.
4. Not really. I like the contrast/twist between ""stays"" and ""go"". 
5.  I think the imagery is good! You get happy when you see it since the girl is in a good mood and you clearly get the connection between the slogan and the picture. There are more than one weather condition in the picture which connects to that she will go to more than one location, and that the drink still will stay the same. Also, the girl in the image shows how to use the little loop function on the bottle which is positive.

1. The imagery doesn't work very well for me, it is not very authentic. 
2. ""where is she going?"" 
3. That the girl is leaning out of a car window, I don't see why you would do that in real life, especially when it is cold outside. 
4. I think it is good. You could maybe make it into ""Finish the day with the same temperature you started"".
5. As said, I think that the imagery could be different. Maybe if it showed a couple of friends having a stop on the way, outside the car, drinking their beverages from the bottle. Then it would be clear that they were going somewhere and also showcase the cold climate and therefore the benefits of a warm drink. I think it actually is good to have one concept that is this simple, since it is impossible to misunderstand what the product is about. I would not make any changes to the imagery, although if I had to change anything it would maybe be to change the slogan into something like ""stay consistent where ever you go"" or ""It stays no matter where you go"".

I like this slogan, it's catchy! It is clear that the temperature stays consistent for more than 12 hours inside the bottle. I would change the imagery though, to something more original. As said before, maybe a couple of friends sitting outside the car when it is darker outside in a cold climate would make it even more obvious why you would appreciate a drink that stays warm for a long time (since you won't have access to a boiler or something like that in your car, in the middle of nowhere). 1. I associate the word ""pure"" to fresh and clean water actually. The word reminds me of something clean. Refreshments are everything you can drink, thus it also in some way links to an alcoholic beverage (which according to me aren't pure). In second picture, it looks like she is out in the woods for a walk or similar. 
2. That the ""refreshments"" are not an alcoholic beverage but rather something you would drink when you are out hiking or something (since she is wearing active wear). That if you're out in the woods you may not be close to a coffee shop or something.
3. That the drink inside stays clean and fresh, without any additives, and will put out your thirst all day long. 
4. Well, although the word ""pure"" can have various meanings. To me, if there would be coffee in the bottle I would not describe it as ""pure"". 
5. Honestly, the picture does not really link very much to the main idea except for that the woman in the picture looks very healthy. If she came straight out of the shower or just had a swim in a lake it would make more sense.
6.I think it should be another picture linking to the slogan in order to enhance the word ""pure"". Maybe that she is taking a swim in a lake in Switzerland and you can see the nature and the alp tops in the background. That is pure to me. 1. What she is wearing and the setting.
2. What beverage is inside the bottle. 
3. That you will have to refill the bottle during the day and maybe all the various drinks you pour are not ""pure"". 
4. nope. 
5. As said, I think that it should be another setting. See previous page about my idea of taking a swim in a lake. If she is out for a hike and just had a swim, an ice cold sip of water is generally not accessible. 

1. Maybe that in some cases you would like to let your coffee cool down a little bit in the cup before you drink it, which will be difficult if you pour it straight into a thermos. 
2. Why she would drink coffee in the woods/what situation and setting is she in. 
3. I don't disagree. 
4.No I don't think so. 
5. I mean it would maybe make even more sense if the woman was on her way to work because that is when you typically drink coffee, or is at a conference or similar. Although, I totally get why she is in the woods, because maybe she is out for an expedition all day long and won't have ny access to brew more coffee. As described before, I would do another shoot with the same model with a more original setting, suggestion wise a lake in Switzerland or similar with the alps in the background to emphasis the word ""pure"" in the concept. Also, this would make it very clear that the refreshment in the bottle is ice cold water (because of the lake and the snowy alps). 

I really do like the second picture and the slogan to it. To me as a Swede, it makes perfect sense that you would want to have a good and small thermos with you if you spend all day out the woods. As said before, I think the lightning etc is very nice in the picture as well which makes it appealing. I would definitely choose concept number S. This because sustainability and climate is a very big thing and a trend in Sweden right now. Especially in Stockholm, people love to stay trendy. Also, since it is very cold in Sweden during the winter the wording makes perfect sense in the first concept. To have a bottle that is both sustainable AND keeps your coffee warm during an entire cold winter day would to many Swedes be very interesting. Also, since being healthy and staying hydrated is another important thing in Sweden (and in Stockholm especially) the second concept would be good as well. Although, changing the slogan into something like ""staying hydrated is now sustainable"" would make an even bigger impact, I believe. 

I think that if the imagery went through the suggested changes it would be even more relevant in Sweden, since many people (including myself) are obsessed with staying environmental friendly.",Splash,
301066,Linda,Rintoul,Ljrintoul@gmail.com,"Concept R appealed most.  
My lifestyle doesn't lean towards hiking and being fancy free as I'm presently fulltime parenting so just seeing the person and product was enticing enough as I'm generally craving an elusive 'hot' coffee or glass of water (& neither seem on hand).
The red against blue drew my attention.  1.

The overall use of 'sustainable' brings to mind preserving the environment.
Cold flask
Isolated and cold

Hot flask
Isolated and daring or maybe seeking mental clarity. Sitting on the edge of a cliff evokes these different thoughts.

2. Amenities may not be readily available and therefore it would be beneficial to be carrying your flask.

3.
Show you really care for your planet, carry a flask.

4. Perfectly

5. Not as clearly, I am distracted from the sustainable angle by the solitude in both pictures. It's not eerie but reasonably concerning. Again, I am a parent and I am aware of mental health issues that may one day invade my children and this is at the forefront of my mind when looking at both pictures. My first thought is both people are teenagers.

6. I would like to see some enjoyment in the pictures as sustainability shouldn't be a burden, rather a positive way of living. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
I can't see their faces and so I lean towards thinking the pictures are 'dark' in emotion.

What questions does it raise?
Why are they isolated?
Would you really walk through the snow on your own?


What things do you disagree with? 
I don't disagree with anything in particular.

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
I like the wording.

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
I'm not partial to the imagery. The red cliff background to the snow isn't what I think of when I imagine the snow, rather green trees and snow.

Sitting right on the edge of cliff pondering life, doesn't leave me feeling positive. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?  

Hot flask
Add a friend to the snow image or maybe your pet dog running ahead... Something a little more uplifting than walking alone in the woods...
Change the red cliffs to snow peaks and green trees. I say this only because it's more consistent with our environmental landscape and I would connect easier.

Cold flask
Withdraw him from the cliff's edge. Maybe show the side of his face, comfortably pondering the great heights of life.

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?

Changes to the wording?

I love the wording.

Cold flask
'Refreshment' works well. As when I think of sustainability it's a lifestyle choice to do the right thing and so you are not seeking to quench thirst per se, rather enjoying your moment.

Changes to the imagery?
As per above.

I do like the coastal landscape, it's reminiscent of our country. 1. A young, happy individual. Fancy free and enjoying life.

2. Enjoying life to it's fullest, even being a bit crazy by hanging out of a moving car window.

3. Be happy and have it all 

4. 
Cold flask
Very well, it's succinct and clear.

Hot flask
I like the wording, it makes sense and is believable. 

5.
Cold flask
The picture doesn't really portray a hot climate, so I can't quite link how her water would get so hot that this flask is a necessity. Maybe more vibrant blue sky would help. I'd almost use this wording for the other picture as there is a clear distinction between the two.

Hot flask
Not sure I marry up this young and wild individual being desirous of hot coffee. It seems as though she is touring in a van, which probably evades her of basic necessities like power... let alone a kettle to make hot coffee.

6.The imagery to tie in with the benefit of the flask. In particular the hot flask idea would be more obvious if the model was cold and appreciating a hot coffee, whereas she is warm enough to hang out of the window with her sleeve rolled up... What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
The disconnection between the benefit of the flask and the person's environment. 

What questions does it raise?
How does this flask benefit the person in their environment?

What things do you disagree with? 
Not sure I agree with the message of a young girl hanging out the window of a moving vehicle. Maybe the parent in my reacting to possible dangers like ice on the road or a deer running out in front of them...

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
I really like the wording.

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
I prefer more risk averse ads. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?

Cold flask

Make backdrop vibrant blue, so I really relate to feeling hot and then the relief of a cold drink.

Hot flask
Have the young lady sitting in her van, with her feet up on the dash drinking her coffee. This would make me appreciate a hot drink.

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?

Changes to the wording?

No changes.

Changes to the imagery?
Just as per above. 1. The first image clearly conveys hydration. Someone active, on the go.

The second image portrays the satisfaction of enjoying a hot coffee. Her face captures this well. It's almost relief.

2. This individual is active and busy. Fitness and health are evident in both pictures, which is appealing.

3. Hydration or a hot coffee, always on hand.

4. Makes the point well. However when I think of drinking water, which is all I drink during the day, save for 1 coffee, then I'm considering hydration and all the benefits that go hand in hand ie: good body functionality above 'refreshment'.

The coffee blurb is clear and in the age of 'keep cups' this appeals as we are encouraged to plan ahead and thus save the planet. This product allows me to achieve this with the added benefit of it remaining hot.

5. The imagery works well.

The red image appeals most, possibly just the colour combination. However I like the idea that regardless of where you are you're covered if you have this flask on hand.

Re the hot image. Again the colours are my main focus and the khakis is less effective. That may be because I can't quickly identify if the individual is working or sporting and thus can't immediately connect with her.

6. I'd amplify the message in the hot image by making it clearer who is enjoying the drink. We all seem to have a cold coffee awaiting us, prepared earlier in the day. 1. The khakis colour. After a closer look I understand the individual is doing something active however having a hot coffee isn't hard to come by when your being leisurely. There's a coffee shop on every corner. 

2. Who is enjoying the relief of this hot coffee. Is she out exercising or catching up with friends, or rushing off somewhere? I can't quickly identify this.

3. How does the brand name tie in with drinking coffee? I never feel hydrated after drinking coffee... I feel very satisfied though.
Not a disagreement but can the coffee flask keep tea hot too? I presume yes, however the concept doesn't address this.

4.' Refreshment' seems like a luxury. When I need water at different points during the day it's out of necessity - I am totally parched.  I'd relate more to the idea of feeling quenched than the enjoyment of bring refreshed.

5. No negative connotations.
The first image is positive, here is someone active and on the go. A healthy, well presented person.
The second image is a little less clear to me but I can relate to the simple pleasure of hot coffee. 1.
Change colour of jacket in the image relating to hot coffee. I appreciate it's very gender neutral but it lacks punch. Maybe gold/yellow... it simulates sunshine which when I think of it evokes feelings of satisfaction/warmth.

Changes to the wording? 

I think the current wording is effective and succinct

cool flask:
I like 'pure', it brings to mind clean/fresh water. 

I also gravitate to the feeling of hydration as it enables me to function properly.

Hydration, perform at your best

hot flask:

Coffee, hot anytime of the day

The model is exactly as I want to be, she looks funky and independent. Her hair is natural and she is not layered in makeup. She realistically portrays how I want to look and feel when being active.  Interestingly I can relate to her, even though I couldn't look any more different. Concept R

I easily connected with this person, over the landscape imagery in the other concepts.  

I am also a similar age to this person and I am environmentally aware of the impact of single use plastic and coffee cups. I presume we share a similar outlook on this issue and thus relate to her over the landscape images. Also the younger girl seems so fancy free that I can't relate to her (as I am encumbered by the responsibilities of parenthood) and presume she is having too much fun to be concerned about the environment.",Splash,
296587,Vilma,Bjurwill,vilma@bjurwill.com,"I think it sounds great. I would love to know how it's possible to make this happen, especially how to keep it cold. Never have I ever seen or heard about a bottle that can keep water or your drink cold. I don't like the colour, it feels childish. I would like to see something that highlights the good idea and concept behind the bottle, on the bottle. Concept a:
cold: Samma temperatur, var du än går.
hot: Avsluta dagen med samma temperatur som du startade med.

concept r:
cold: Ren förfriskning, hela dagen. (from refreshment to förfriskning which is the best translation I can come up with but it's a word I wouldn't use in marketing purposes.)
hot: Kaffet är som nybryggt hela dagen.

concept s:
cold: nu är den perfekta temperaturen hållbar.
hot: förfriskning är hållbart. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
After seeing the concepts I associate the hydro flask with the nature and sports. Hiking for example, it reminds me of a flask you bring in a backpack in the skislopes or on a mountain. And I think that is what's not said explicitly either. 

I think the main concept is to create something you always think of brining when you need a bottle.

I like the wording and I think it brings out the underlying concept. Both pictures and words together. The pictures brings out a big target group thinking of the different environments the pictures are showing. As mentioned before, I would like to see the bottle showing the good main idea and not just the marketing posts. So you always know what company that came up with the bottle and the idea. I like everything about the concept but as mentioned I would like to see another bottle, it feels like every thermos is look like this. I love short and concise wordings so this ones is working very well to catch my attention. The same with the pictures, but I thought about that it cuts off curtain target group because not everyone have time to spend out in the nature, thinking of 5 out of 7 days in the week are working days. Maybe there should be a picture of someone driving a car and keep the hydro flask in the cupholder. But I understand that you should associate the bottle with the nature but a ""daily"" picture to show that you can use the bottle in every situation. Hydro is sustainable and that is a good way to show by telling the costumers that you can re-use it every day in every situation. As mentioned in the earlier question, it would be great with a normal day picture. Even if you are out traveling and sporting with the hydro flask, it would be good to show that you can use it in daily situations aswell. There you will reach a bigger target of people and show the meaning of sustainable and re-useable. This one is almost the same as the previous one. For me the concept still is very sporty and adventurous. And I associate this with adventures and what you need to bring, in this case the hydro flask. So the pictures is suitable. And if you see the pictures next to each other, it reinforces the wording ""the temperature stays no matter where you go"" considering the different environments the pictures are showing. 

I think the concept is to show how smooth the bottle is to bring at adventures. I liked the previous wordings better, the one ""finish the day with the temperature you started"" sounds a bit un fresh for me. If you reformulate it, it reminds of preservation. It doesn't match with the picture that is very ""fresh"". About the pictures I don't have anything negative to say, they are inviting and inspiring to go outdoors. I understand the wording of ""finish the day with the temperature you started."" but I would reformulate it. Right now I can't come up with something better but it would change it because it sounds like the drink gets old during the day. I love the pictures and get inspired and they meditate joy! I love these concepts! It feels fresh and I literally think of fresh and cold water. 

The concept is to convey a fresh drink all day long.

The pictures and wordings are meditating the concept a very good look and sound. The blue colour goes hand in hand with the refreshing feeling and her looks really convey a trust. I love these concepts more than the previous ones. Like I said, I love the blue colours and it goes hand in hand with the picture and her red jacket. Refreshment is mentioned in the sentence on the red jacket picture and the colours in the picture where coffee is mentioned, is more cozy which works very well. 
The wording ""coffee stays the way you take it"" reminds me of the previous one ""finish the day with the temperature you started with"". It can be associated with something old and unfresh.. If I would change the wording about coffee, I would like to hear something that isn't possible to associate with something old or tinnes goods. 
About the imagery, I think her expression is very trustable but there is something boring with her having the same expression with closed eyes on both pictures. The left one I would like to see the same picture but her with open eyes. That one is the one which is giving me a refreshing and bracing feeling and if she had open eyes I would feel more inspired because she would see more up on the toes and have an on going adventure. I would choose concept R. Because I liked that one the most and I think it would fit the best in Sweden because the pictures doesn't show any climate, surroundings or environments. We don't have, the environments that are shown in the other pictures, so the concept R is the one that would fit the best in sweden.",Splash,
296597,Beca ,Webb ,Rebeccamarie.webb@gmail.com,"Concept A:
1. The cold image is perfect, I instantly think of a cold winters day and a hot drink to have. The hot image I wasn’t sure about as I don’t really associate the forest to be warm like usually it’s always a bit colder because of the trees blocking the sun. 
2. I would swap the hot image for a beach or a packed day in the city where you would be super hot. 
The wording in the hot image ‘finish the day with the temperature it started’ is great I really associated with it and straight away I was like perfect whatever temp I put my drink in that bottle 12 hours later it will be the same.
3. How much are the bottles? where can you get them from?
Concept R:
1. I like both these images, whatever bottle you have for hot and cold it is designed to stay that way. Relatable to the woman who is out and about during a normal day. 
2. The pure refreshment image is good and the write up suits it. Maybe the wording of the Hot one i would change to make it not take it re the coffee.
3. Same for all
Concept S:
1. The images are good but the wording confuses me and makes me not sure what the ad is selling
2. Images i like but not the wording
3. Same for all  1. Cold winter forest needing a hot drink to warm you up. Using sustainable drink bottles not just for single use you are helping to save the planet. A cold beverage all day is something you can have if you have one of these drinks bottles.
2. You are reducing waste buy buying one of these reusable drink bottles
3. Reduce waste, help the environment, buy a reusable drink bottle. 
4. Pretty well, sustainable is mentioned both times and the wording is kept short. 
5. Pretty well, both images are of nature and its beauty. 
6. Have one image be the direct comparison of the other. One image showing a plastic bottle and the effects on a fish in the ocean or something then the other image shows the reusable drink bottle and a clean nature shot like one of the ones above 1. The direct benefits of buying/ using reusable drink bottles some people do not know
2. How are we helping the environment by buying this drink bottle? How long will the perfect temp be sustainable for? 
3. -
4. -
5.  Imagery has no negative connotations. If you are after a clean, pretty nature shot then the imagery is perfect. Have one image on the left hand side show the effects on the environment with a plastic drink bottle. The wastage if produces and the harm it does to the environment. 
Having imagery that hits a little closer to home, what is actually happening to nature out there. 
Having groups in one shot all using sustainable drink bottles not just single individuals, showing they are for everyone not just the environmentally friendly people. Whatever temperature you put your drink in the bottle it remains the same the whole day. 
The wording is very strong and brings forward a very clear image, the bottle keeps your drink no matter if hot or cold that exact temperature you put it in at. 
The winter imagery is good, I think of a hot drink as i see the snow and the girl in a wolly jumper. The hot image i would change to the water as I don't associate the forest with a really hot day. Any where by the water with sunshine you think of having a coll drink. 
Change the hot picture to a water one. The hot image is not what i associate with summer or warm weather to want a cold drink.
Wording is good, would not change anything. 
As previously mentioned in the questions before i would change the left hand image but keep the right image. Wording is good and idea is clear In the first image you could have a series of smaller images showing the girl biking from the forest then hiking through the mountains then going for a surf at the beach. Plays more to the wording re the temperature stays no matter where you go. Showing the girl has been all over the place in one day on a hot day and the drink inside her bottle is still cool. Similar to the previous concept, whatever the temperature of the drink you pour into the bottle it remains the same. 
The first image implies if you had one of the drink bottles you would be refreshed all day long, bring it with you everywhere and you are sorted.
Im not sure about the second image wording, its confusing and doesn't really apply to me. I don't want to drink a little sip of coffee in the morning then drink more of it later in the day. I would rather have it all at once. 
I find the first image alot more relatable and useful The second image wording is confusing and 'take it' doesn't really make sense. 
Does the girl drink one coffee throughout the entire day and it stays the same temperature?
The first image is spot on with the picture and wording, the bottle looks sleek as well and it makes me want to buy one. I'm unsure about how I would change the second image. I would just keep the first and run with that. 
It makes the bottle appealing and looks great to take anywhere. 
Using the same girl in both images does correlate and bring the theme together so keep that consistency and change the wording I would choose Concept S for Australia because it is an extremely beautiful country that cares a lot about the environment. It has beaches surrounding the country that are super clean and also has the Great Barrier Reef. I feel like more and more people are becoming more aware and environmentally friendly. Keep cups are a big thing atm and reusable bottles are also starting to take off. My company CUB just created these Corona sustainable drink bottle much like the ones above and teamed up with Parley a non for profit organisation that cleans up the oceans.  They were hugely successful and generated a great response as customers liked the feeling that they were doing their bit too help.
The images in Concept S show a pretty clear understanding for sustainable actions and using one of of these drink bottles is a quick way to get there.",Splash,
296592,Sophia,Clarke,Sophiaeclarke@gmail.com,"Concept A
Immediately I thought this clearly shows the flasks stay hot and cold, whatever the weather. However I relooked at them and because it says hot and cold underneath that's what guided me. If I just saw the advert without the tags underneath then then I am not sure it's entirely clear that it stays both temperatures. 
I like the pictures as they could emphasize that no matter what the weather they stay hot/cold and show an active lifestyle but perhaps with a bit more information stating hot and cold. What I am not clear about is if it is the same flask that stays hot and cold or whether there are two different flasks one for hot, one for cold. 
Concept R
Like the images as it's nice and simple and I think the tag line is also great. Same feedback as above - not definitely clear this is about temperature and if it's the same bottle for both. 
Concept S
The tag line on the cold advert is the first mention of temperature and I think this summarises this really well. Good use of word sustainable as it's clear it maintains the temp. For hot I wouldn't necessarily use the word refreshment for a hot drinks but again I don't think this is clear that it's about temp sustainability. Both photos on this look like stock imagery . Bolder to have the blue section with the big bottle and some slightly clearer information about the temp sustainability.  1. First - outdoor lifestyle, wholesomeness, climbing, America, camping. The blue makes me think of coldness not hot drinks
1. Second  - travelling, young people, outdoorsy, wild swimming, Greece, Devon

2. First  healthiness, cold temperatures, alpine freshness
2. Second a - healthy outdoorsy lifestyle, warm weather

3. First  - Keep drinks hot in the cold weather while you're hiking
3. Second  - Carry cold drinks around in the heat while you;re travelling

4. First - Wording this is good because it refers to temperature and sustainability. It doesn't completely cover it though as it's not clear the flask keeps the liquid hot.
4. Second  - Not as well  it's not clear it's about temp. 

5. First  - The blue, the snow makes me feel cold - I don't think of this as an advert for something that keeps things hot.
5. Second - this is imae is quite boring, doesn't really say anythig. 

6. First-   A better image might be snowy background, sitting round a fire and sipping the flask/blowing on it. Red background and some additional wording relating to the flask keeping things hot all day. 6. Second advert - take the wording  from first ad and use on both for recognition that it's a set of adverts and  words about the flask keeping drinks cold no matter how hot it is. A better image -  a face looking hot and sweaty drinking from a bottle with beads of cold water on it. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
Again both very outdoorsy. The blue for the hot drink doesn't work. Sustainable refreshment does not necessarily mean temperature to me. 

What questions does it raise?
Are there two types of flask? 

What things do you disagree with? 
For some reason both images make me thnk of america. Which is fine but I'm not planning on camping in the Rockies any time soon so i don't think I woudl connect with the adverts if I saw them in a magazine. I'd ptobably flip past. 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Sustainable refreshement to me is about regularly drinking liquids. I woudl't necessarily think this is about temperature. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Slightly boring imagery. The blue background on the hot advert. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
think about a set of ads that isn't only about the outdoors or this looks like a specialist camping product. Refreshment doesn't denote temperature explicitly so I'd think about the wording. 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
A tag line that says more about the temperature or what the flask does. 

Changes to the wording?
Ice cold water for 12 hours. 
The flask that maintains temperature - hot or cold - for 12 hours. 

Changes to the imagery?
If sticking with outdoors theme, somsone sitting round a camp fire in the dark and snow sipping the flask woudl make me think of a hot drink more, red background. 
Beads of water on the cold flask. make the scene look hotter, that could almost be cold or hot at the beach 1. First ad - outdoors, youth, hill walks, lone traveller, camping, carefree, selfies
1. Second ad - america, camping, hippy lifestyle, cool temperatures

2. 1st ad Take the bottle with you in your active lifestyle, drinks stay same temp
2. 2nd ad -  to me this implies coldness because of the blue, outdoor adventurous lifestyle

3. 1st ad A flask that compliments your outdoor lifestyle
3. 2nd ad long days travelling, your drink stays same temp (to me this looks like cold)

4. 1st ad - really well, clear this is about temperature
4. 2nd ad - also good and clear. 

5. 1st ad - good if a little stock imagery
5. 1st ad - looks cold. Same feedback as previous concept. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
6. 1st ad I think it's fine
6 2nd ad Needs red, more clarity it's hot drinks not cold. 1. 1st ad and 2nd ad - they both heavily about outdoors lifestyle/travelling. I could imagine it working well in a camping equipment magazine rather than to appeal to young pofessionals. 

2. 1st and 2nd ad - is this for life in the city or is it specialist camping equipment? Is it the same bottle for cold and hot?

3. Nothing

4. I think the wording in both is the best so far. More clarity that it's hot and cold. 

5. 1st and 2nd ad -  both perfectly nice images but remind me of stock imagery of 'young people travelling'. Not very accessible for older people or for people who want a reusable bottle for normal life in a city. 1. 1st/2nd ad - I'm unclear if this is a set of adverts or if there woudl just be two. This works well for a target market that is outdoorsy but to appeal to a wider market needs a wider demographic of models and settings so it doesn't come across as a product for young travellers. 

2. a) 1st/2nd ad - add a tagline that says 'keeps drinks cold/hot for 12 hours'. 
b) 1st/2nd ad - Consider using models that aren't only young to appeal to older market. Consider some images of commuters on hot trains and cold platforms. Change the colour for the 'hot' advert to red 1.  A - active lifestyle, beach walks, hiking, jogging, dog walking .
1. B - Autumn, winter sun, crisp and cold weather (the blue makes me think of ice/cold drinks)

2. A - that this is a flask for outdoors fitness pursuits
2. B - that she is drinking a warm drink (by the way she is drinking it - not seen in the others ads so far)

3. A - take your flask with you on a hike and stay refreshed
3.  B - make a coffee at home and take it to the park with you.

4.  A - I don't think that the word refreshments demonstrates that the flask keeps your drink cold all day. 
4.  B - really don't like this wording. To be the way your take it is latte/flat white etc not the temperature (hot coffee is a given), so this doesn't not get across that the temperature is maintained all day. 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
5.A - i like that you can actually see her taking a drink from the flask and for some reason you can kind of tell it's a cool drink, maybe because of the spout thing 
5. B quite well but the blue makes me think of cold. 

6. Think about the wording to be more direct it's about temperature for both. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
Neither definitely show it's about temperature. Again it seems active lifestyle based which isn't the only use of a reusable bottle. 
What questions does it raise?
Do both flasks keep hot and cold or one for each? 
What things do you disagree with? 
The wording about the coffee doesn't work at all. 
Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
The coffee wording. 
What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
I think they're both fine. it's not very exciting or original but it gets the point cross. Think about the blue for the hot drink though. 1. I'd change the wording on both. I would simplify it. I would consider images that also show other settings than the outdoors. 

2. a) State exactly what makes this different/special:  'Keeps your water cold all day', 'coffee stays hot for 12 hours'
b) these are fine but a bit uninspiring. Could consider someone sitting on a hot beach drinking from the flask with cold beads of water on it, and for the hot a commuter on a cold platform Concept R  - it's the least outdoorsy/travelling of the concepts as it's more focused on the person than the countryside. The model looks more British to me than the other ones as they look like young Americans.",Splash,
296593,James,Williams,ohmrwilliams@gmail.com,"Concept A. 
First I don't think you should have a blue bottle on the blue back ground, the hero product doesn't pop.  In both pictures, you can't really engage with the person, she has sunglasses in one and has her back turned in the next. The photographs make it feel natural and real, although the quality of the pics could be better. I think the copy doesn't flow very well, doesn't make easy sense in my head. Also, it feels like the product is directly aimed at people who do lots of outdoors stuff - which is great, but what if you're not into those? It looks practical but not particularly stylish or aspirational. I don't feel like I want to know about this product.
Concept R.
I do much prefer the copy on this one. Short and concise. The message of what the product does is more clear.  All the pictures feel cold to me, so I don't get that there's really enough differentiation between the two products/uses. Again, I don't want to know more.
Concept S.
This is the best one for me so far. The pictures are much better, I have an emotional reaction to the images, which I didn't have before. I like the play on words with 'sustainable. The  whole thing feels a lot more engaging, aspirational, makes me feel like this product would enhance my travels, makes me feel like thinking about my next trip.  Thoughts of holidays, travel, solitude, relaxation, peace, reflection, the environment. It implies that wherever you are, hydration is an important thing, especially if you're alone. It implies that as well as painting a sustainable temperature of your drink, because it's set in nature, your mind thinks that the somehow, the bottle is sustainable too, perhaps the materials it's made of as well as its use. Main idea is that nature and the temperature of your drink can stay constant and reliable. I think the wording is the best one out of all of them, makes me feel something. And the imagery is the best one too! Makes me want to visit those places, the composition is great too. I know blue is a natural colour, but the blue bootle on the blue background, doesn't look natural next to the earthy tones of the pictures, perhaps it needs to be a quieter colour and on a natural background? The colours of the bottle on the blue back ground don't work for me. Again, it does feel slightly 'backpackerish' in tone, so it does feel like it's for a particular market. It's not hugely aspirational. 
Maybe I'm being silly, but it feels like it just keeps your drinks cold, maybe that's to do with the colour again? I like the locations, but again, I feel a bit disconnected to the person in both picture. There is a melancholy feeling to both pictures.
Disagree with colours. Also, perhaps the cold environment should have more snow in it and the hot environment should look hotter, there's not a big enough difference between the two.
'Now the perfect temp is sustainable' I think is easy to understand and I feel I get the message straight away. Although, 'temp' as opposed to 'temperature' might confuse people. The second, 'Refreshment is sustainable' is a bit more ambiguous, but I like how to the point it is.
The imagery could be a little better, like I said above, colder climate should look colder, hotter should look hotter. Maybe pictures that are a bit more breathtaking, these both do a feel a little flat, a bit blah. But it's not a huge problem. I would change then colour of the bottles, perhaps have a cold coloured one in the hot environment, and a warm coloured bottle in the cold environment. I'd change the same colour back ground. I'd make the locations be more different from each other, a tropical rainforest/really hot sandy beach for hot  and then a snow covered mountain/ice caps for the cold. It just feels too close to each other at the moment. 'Let's go' is a bit of a dull tagline, perhaps it could be something that is a bit more to do with the words 'hot and cold'? 
looking at them, I feel it's missing fun, aspiration, excitement, it all feels a little sad. The wording is fine, but feel like it could be a bit punchier. 'Sit and think? Cold drink' , Cold spot? Make it hot' ....not those obviously, but something that makes my brain engage a bit more. 1. This brings to mind travel, social media,reportage, spontaneity, fun, the open road. 2. It implies a sense of freedom I think, didn't love the pictures at first, but now I'm looking at them more, I actually like the feeling of fun, spontaneity and freedom they seem to be promoting. It also makes me think of adventure, not planning a holiday, but just chucking a few things in a bag, jumping the camper van and going wherever. 3. 'As long as we have our Hydro Flask, who needs a map?' 'Let's have an adventure', kind of thing. 4.This is my least fave thing, the words don't flow easily, I get the message, but it feels clunky. 5. Think the image of the girl smiling is very engaging and the other one is less successful, I get it, but the back of someones head isn't particularly fun, even if she had her arms in the air, excited, but this just feel a bit flat. 6. Like I've said before, just more of a difference between the hot and cold environments, cooler, concise wording and tagline. Pay me, I could come up with better! lol 1. Again, the colours of the bottles on the blue background. The photographs are fine, but could be better. The pictures could also be more engaging. Plus the words are not great.
2.I'm trying to think of any questions it raises, but nothing majorly, a bit like before, I do feel like I understand what it does, but I feel like it's to keep my drink cold, it's such a cold advertising campaign, needs more warmth - in general. 3. I disagree with having people in a picture that we can't see their faces properly, perhaps if it was more of a social media style picture, then you could forgive that, so it works best in the image wit the sunglasses, but even still would be soooo much better if you can see her eyes, and like I already said, a picture of someone from behind, an a low energy kind of pose, just doesn't feel very enrolling. 4. Both wording are clunky, I kind of understand the first one, just think better words could be used, but I get what it's trying to say, but the 'Finish the day with the temperature you started' sounds awful. Is there another word for temperature? it isn't a particularly exciting word, and it's long. The whole thing needs to be cooler, sexier, witty, play on words etc...this feels awkward. 6. I've adressed the picture problems I have above. Better colours for bottle and background. Take sunglasses off model and make the environment feel hotter, more exciting. Same with the other image, it's a bit flat and dull. At the end of the day the product is a bottle, so the images and the type around it need to be brilliant, too elevate the product, not drag it down. I do quite like the idea of a social media type photograph, selfie thing, but perhaps have  two people in the image, a couple, or best friends, then you can identify with them. The wording needs to be scrapped and start again, temperature is not a sexy word, so think of things that convey the same message but in an easier, lighter, more aspirational way. A beat, a moment, silence, rest, pause, hydration, active, outdoors, refreshing.
It implies this person has been on the go, active and is stopping for a much needed drink.
It feels like the objective is to make us feel like this bottle is convenient, something that adds purpose, to our day, that we need this in our lives if we're outside and thirsty.
The main idea for concept is that this bottle enhances your outdoor adventure. That you need this to make your activity enjoyable. It's almost a reward for how hard you've worked.
The wording is concise and clear in the first one. I get the message of the second coffee one, but think it could be worded better.
Imagery, I get the idea, but think the model looks sleepy in both, eyes closed is not that great, nit in both anyway. The 2nd back lit one is a horrible angle, plus both I feel like they don't include me in the experience.
Better, more enrolling pictures and a week on the words to make them flow better The colours, like I've said before are off. And now you have the model wearing red in the supposed cold drink one, which is dominating the picture, my eye just goes to the body warmer. Plus, eyes both closed is not engaging for me. She also dominates the pictures in both, which doesn't give me a good sense of the environment that she's in. Out of all three concepts, these are the worst pictures for me.  I ask where she is, is she enjoying the drink and the environment, what the story is? It's pretty unclear. I'd change the styling and on both, if include the environment a bit more to convey that she's in a hot and cold place more clearly and at least have her eyes open in one of them. Perhaps a smile?
'Coffee stays hot, just how you made it' 'Coffee, just the way you made it' 'Hot Coffee? All day' 'Coffee still hot? Stupid question' 'Of course it's still hot' I don't know, anything but 'Coffee stays the way you make it' just sounds strange! Change colour of bottle and background. Make them feel like they are hot and cold. Change the pictures, make them feel more aspirational, joyous, cool, sexy, calm, exciting, anything than what they are at the moment - out of all the concepts, this is the most confused. Easily solved with better pictures, better tag lines and a more defined concept. These are very flat. I wouldn't be interested in the product, which I'm sure is great, because the images and the tag lines let the bottle down. I like the solitude figure, but she just needs to have a purpose, at the moment , it feels too staged. I'd choose concept C because it makes me feel like the hydro flask would be needed in these environments, as opposed to a bottle of water that I can buy in a service station whilst I was in my camper van. Concept C, feels more epic, aspirational, different to where I live and makes me think about booking a trip and possibly including a new hydro bottle into my travel itinerary. Plus the photographs are much more interesting than the other two, which feel like snapshots, people are so used to seeing online/social media reportage style pictures now, that seeing a photograph of a stunning tropical climate or a sub zero environment would make me use my imagination a bit more, think about the world a bit more, take me out of the everyday and into the extraordinary.",Splash,
301969,Shoko,Takahashi,taka_sho@me.com,"Any cold one doesn’t fit to image.  I won’t be intriegued by ‘cold’ copy when I see either snow, down vest, or high mountain hiking, which all are supposed to be cold atmosphere.   Those odd feelings distract me from thinking coherency of each concept.  
I like concept R most, because I could easily imagine what I could feel about temperature of drinks, which strikes me at most when I’m drinking it, not holding it. 

Concept A and S, I don’t know what I’d like to know more.  I don’t get how both copies and images are related to drinks, if I weren’t told this is about Walter flask survey.   Concept R, nothing more.  I have what I need to know from ad. Concepts A 
Cold: どこへ行く時も温度はそのまま  Wherever you go, templature stays. (I changed sentence order, more suitable for copies in Japanese.  Otherwise, direct translation, which sounds OK.)
Hot:  入れた時の温度のまま、1日を終えよう  Let’s finish the day with the temprature you poured. ( “Temprature you started” is  difficult to translate  because we rarely say “we start a day”  in Japanese nor mention the term ‘temperature’  when we talk about mood. )
 Concepts R
Cold:  1日中いつでも気分転換  Refresh yourself  whenever in the day ( The term refreshment “気分転換” has nothing to do with drinks or snacks in Japanese but purely means retrieval  of energy. )
Hot: コーヒーはいつでもあなたの温度に you can get coffee at the temprature of your like

Concepts S
Cold: 完璧な温度がいつまでも続く Perfect temprature will last a long time (“Sustainable” is the word brought into Japan as alien term in the context of environmental activities, and hard to connect to verb “sustain”, which is often translated into different word,
Hot: 爽快な気分がいつでも手に入る  I can get reflashed air at any time ( same reason above 1: Outdoor.  Solitary.  Trail.  Independent.  Nature. 
2: It is environmentally sustainable to use flask, maybe instead of plastic bottles.   |  The bottle is your only friend to bring to the trip of self-exploration?
3: It is environmentally sustainable to use flask, not just it sustains temperature of drink inside.
4: [Cold]  Good. [Hot] Good
5: [Cold]  I don't get main message of the image at all.  I don't know where to focus on, what the whole background means, what the person does at the site, all are quite confusing.
[Hot] I don't get the main message of the image.  Is it about nature, or trip, or challenge, or independence?  Hard to understand.  Even if it is about sustainability, the clouded beach is not quite well-pictured enough to appeal the necessity of keeping its beauty.
6: The image should be more directly tell what is the behavior to live with nature environmentally sustainably. ex, image of hikers trying to put natural spring/meltwater into the flask. 1: Environmental sustainability is a global issue, which is usually difficult for me to instantly connect with keeping drinks warm/cold in water flask, that is very personal needs.  I mean, bringing a bottle for outdoor trip is easily connected, but keeping drink inside warm itself doesn't mean anything to do with keep the environment intact, and that raises a question ""how does the temp help sustainability?"" especially in [Hot] copy.
2: What sustainable means? 
3: Unfit of copies and images.
4: ""Perfect temp is sustainable"" ???  
5: It is hard for me to see connection to environmental sustainability to the images, both. [either hot or cold]
a: Abundance of nature is now sustainable with you
b: Change image to hikers trying to pour waters from natural spring/meltwater into the flask

[Cold]
a:  Refreshment is sustainable
b: Change image to couple of park rangers gathering and having a break in the woods, suggesting they just came back from job keeping the environment clean/natural. 1:  Looks cold outside.  Water flask is a little off in the picture.
2: It is assumed that I should keep drinks inside the bottle all day long without refilling.
3: Temperature of drink inside the flask will stay all day long.
4: [Hot]  Good   [Cold] I can guess the point, but it doesn't sound me right at all.
5: [Hot] OK but I do not get if the bottle has heat retention function.  [Cold] Same. ok but I will never imagine the bottle keeps drinks inside at the same temp.
6: [Hot & Cold] Change the image that can focus on drinks not the flask.  Pouring image, or drinking image, which gives visual information about the temperature inside. 1: I do not get who is meant to be use it. I don't get situation when and where I use this.
2: [Hot]  Is it a comment/image when I get home?   Should I keep drink I poured in the morning all day long?  It doesn't seem enough content.
3: [Cold] To me it seems not that hot outside, and I won't drink icy-cold anything at the site shown in the image, even the water flask will keep drink super cold.
     [Hot] I don't go over myself out of cars like the image, and IF I did, I WOULDN'T hold water flask on the hand in that situation.
4: [Cold] It sounds right.  [Hot] My day sometimes starts in very bad mood, and getting better afterwards.  I appreciate the change during the day, and do not always want to finish the day with the way how I started.
5: [Cold]  OK [Hot] So fake. [HOT] 
a: I think the wording is OK
b: Change the picture more in hot atmosphere. or totally change it so that viewer can image the inside state of drinks.  Poring to glasses, or sweaty person drinking heavily.

[Cold] 
a: Try not to expect keep drinks inside all day long, instead, something like telling you can get warmth of tea you last poured back in the office, and enjoy during car on the way home.
b: Change the picture to the drivers going home next to Hydro flask in cap holder 1: Outside seems cold, but the inside of the bottle seems to be warm. Active, extrovert image of users.  The drink will calm those energy down, and give a moment for break.
2: The water flask is meant to be used outside, such as one of camping gear. 
3: Drink in the bottle will stay as the way what you want.
4: [Cold] I don't really get what ""pure"" means in the sentence.  [Hot] Nicely done
5: [Cold] Good.  Just do not get what the woman really wants (either hot or cold, soda or coffee) in the situation.  [Hot] Seems perfect as long as the copy mentioned coffee she's drinking
6: If the drink inside has to be cold, the image should be pictured in super-hot / sweaty situation. 1: Unless it is cold outside, hot inside the bottle, I do not get what will be benefit for me keeping temperature of drinks.
2: What's inside the bottle?   When is it to be used, during mountain training? in a break of hiking? morning at summer house? camping garage? 
3: Outfit of the [Cold] woman.  I never see her like a woman drinking cold drink.
4: ""Pure"" refreshment, what is pure?   Stays the way ""you take it"" -  the way I take it?? does it do anything other than keeping temperature? Can it make my favorite tea in my favorite strongness?
5: Can't tell weather influence.  If I drink something outside, my mood of drinking behavior is strongly affected by the weather.   Current image doesn't have much about weather information I can refer myself in that situation. [Cold]
a. all day long -> at any time
b. Change the image background sunny and energetic situation - such as beach, scout camp, group of people cleaning-up volunteer work, and so on.  Definitely change outfit.

[Hot]
a: you take it -> you like it
b: Add some steam rising from the mouth of the flask. Concept R
More and more people do not go out even in weekends in Japan, especially young people.  Less and less people drive a car.  Even in countryside, it is almost inherent culture that people just go straight driving to work and back in home, without any leisure in between.   It is more familiar scene for people that having a drink in a break of working outside, or in the morning waiting for buses/trains outside, than bringing scenario of exploring nature.  Showing outdoor image might motivate some people to become more outdoor, yet I'm afraid the volume of customers who could be attracted will much smaller if you targeted only those type of people.",Splash,
296594,Ben,Turner,Benjamin.n.turner@gmail.com,"Not really a fan of the blue packaging. Seems too outdoorsy for me and my needs, I like those things but not what I use a flask for and I wouldn’t be attracted to those images as they don’t reflect my life. Looks like something from Berghaus or a very specialist camping outdoorsy type brand I speak English so this isn’t relevant to me....
Not relevant not relevant not relevant (having to meet minimum words which is a bit silly but there you go) not I like the sustainable aspect as that is a big plus for me with using a refillable flask. But again top specialist and outdoorsy focused to appeal to me. 

I think the link to everyday life needs to be more apparent, and the versatility of it. I think north face as a brand do this well, made that transistikn from a specialist adventure brand to a street ware and everyday ware brand. I think this needs to bridge that gap a bit. I’d imagine this promoting a tent or a portable gas camp fire with those images which narrows the target market and appeal.

I think the benefit of it though shows it is tough and able to cope with extreme circumstances so conveys durability, robustness and longevity. You imagine the people using this know their kit and don’t mess about so if they are using this then it is well engineered. 

The wording around sustainability does work well too, it’s subtle but to me is saying look at our beautiful outdoors and making the link to sustainability and not ruining it. So in that way it conveys it well and is a good message. It raises the question, is this for me? And probably no. 

It doesn’t convey a cool brand I would want to buy into, I like brands that blend functionality with style but this is too functional.

For instance Rapha the cycling apparel brand does this well conveying style and functionality. The cycling equivalent of this to me would be selling a full Lycra suit which isn’t something I would buy. I would buy a Rapha rain jacket that is both functional and stylish and outdoorsy. 

Looking more closely it is a bit solitary, people on their own has a tranquility to it but also a bit of a sadness. Where are their mates? Ha I think the core of my issue is that I like a refillable bottle because it is functional firstly, stylish secondly and thirdly I get the feel good factor of actually (for a change) doing something that’s a good step to rescuing waste. So I would for a way to have that less overt and work into ideas that promote the other things I personally would be more motivated by. 

Also, is it not a given that a reusable bottle is more sustainable? Not convinced that should be the first thing that would make this stand out vs any other brand doing it. This for me looks like very outdoorsy adventurous kit and things that aren’t going to let you down in a functional way. Namely keeping things at the right temperature. Built to withstand extreme conditions and support extreme pursuits.

I think the wording on the first pic links better to the image. I don’t immediately get the sense that the second image they have had a long day and that’s why it’s a good thing the drink is still warm, for starters it’s still light! Or maybe they are setting out for a long day and in that case again doesn’t link well. 

Again the idea of community and friendship is lacking a bit, seems a bit self obsessed instagrammy. Ppl that hike for the likes (see what I did there?!) as opposed for the adenture and self fulfilment. I think temperature should be linked to supporting you in moments you need to be recharged. So the cold one would be two people that are refreshing after a long hike on the sun and are proud of what they have done. Not this fake travel blogger looking girl.

And the hot one again I think is missing the point a bit. You want something hot at the right moment, as for me when using a flash of hot drink I don’t sip it I drink it in one sitting. And it’s at that time you want it the right temp. I think this is a difference for me between hot and cold, cold i sip and hot i drink.

So the second should be an image when taking restbite before a final push or an image that brings home the idea of a day well spent and then a refreshing drink after it. I kind of did this in the last one? :( going to paste my answer here too, hope that’s ok?!

So the second should be an image when taking restbite before a final push or an image that brings home the idea of a day well spent and then a refreshing drink after it. I think this is focusing on temperature again but in a less overt way. The idea of a cold drink being refreshing and the hot drink staying how you like it implies that. 

I like the coffee one as I can emphasise with that feeling and using a specific drink brings that to life for me. I like that is focusing on a specific moment too. The refreshment idea in the first I’m not sure the image fits, I picture refreshment cliche but cold drink on a beach, or when hot and sweaty during exercise. I can’t tell if she’s somewhere cold or not and although outside she doesn’t look particularly in need of refreshment.

At first I liked the coffee one but I think that’s because I liked the idea of focusing on that drink and the image fits well with a refreshing coffee break. But I’m not sure with ‘how you take it?’ Because you say that to people with milk and sugar. And that doesn’t link up to the benefit of you get with a flask of it staying hot/warm. Because no matter how you take yours eg oat milk, 3 sugars and caramel syrup that is going to stay the same in any container. It’s hkw it tastes and the the temp when you go to drink it they should be worried about. Make it more obvious she needs some refreshment. Again maybe give her some mates?! 

Second one, I think should be about that moment she is in there having a coffee break and the flask not letting her down. She’s tired and ready for a break, she’s found a nice spot in the sun, maybe a tree stump to sit on, she’s forgetton she’s not got any mates all’s good. But then if her coffee is all luke warm it would be a big let down. This should be about getting those moments right and making sure it comes through for you. I’d go with concept R. I think it is more versatile but also open to interpretation and people could identify with it in more ways and in more situations. I think the other two are more niche and fewer people would identify with them",Splash,
295460,Ciaran,Thapar,cthapar27@gmail.com,"What is your initial reaction?
What do you like? What don't you like? 
What would you like to know more about after seeing the concepts? 

A

Size of flasks make sense: wider one for hot, taller one for cold.
Cold - Doesn't look hot enough in the image. Word 'temperature' is too neutral, there needs to be a reference to the irritation of drinks going warm; the copy more generally is just bland and unremarkable.
Hot - Why would someone sit like that out of a window with their flask? I think the words are good though, as that's what I like about my flask at the moment.

R
C - Good to have the concept of an experience remaining available to you all day words-wise. Not really seeing why the woman in the picture would be hot though.
H - ""take it"" a bit jarring. I want to see more of her surroundings.

S
Size of flasks make sense given that cold vs hot have been switched. But Cold/Hot should equate to the liquid temperature not the weather.
C - ""temp"" too informal, sustainable too wordy. I like this distance of photo: scenic and contextual. 
H - this is my fav image and the words actually work because despite the word sustainable, the phrase is punchy enough, and the feeling of available refreshment I think is what you want to last the longest from having a flask like this AC = it doesn't matter where you go, you'll be able to drink the same drink at the same temperature
AH = your drink will stay the same temperature the whole day
RC = the feeling of absolute comfort from drinking from your flask is available to you throughout the day
RH = you can have coffee the way you like it whenever you like using this flask
SC = nowadays, because of this invention, the perfect temperature of your drink can stay all day
SH = the feeling of being refreshed is forever available to you

I've tried to just explain all of these quite bluntly, in more detail to how they are written in the adverts, using the sort of images/concepts/feelings which appear in my head when I read these sentences. First:

1) it's annoyed me that you've used the word temp and not temperature. the walk looks sweet. sustainable is a bit of a geeky word especially alongside ""temp"".
2) either hot or cold or warm or whatever and the feeling of comfort that temperature gives you is something you can make last into the future, and this is a new technology so it's exciting
3) that you can go into quite remote places and with your flash remain in sustained bliss with the comfort of your favourite, perfectly hot/cold drink
4) the ""now"" makes it sound a bit disingenuously like this is the first flask like this. temp is very annoying.
5) I like the imagery: the context and pleasant scenery is exactly where I can imagine wanting a flask
6) change wording, use same image or maybe cut it with another image of the person closer up drinking from it on a break.

Second:
1) my fav one. simple slogan which works and I think says more than the other sentences despite being shorter. Taking a break with a view is a great place to enjoy a drink.
2) the feeling of being refreshed is something that can last and doesn't need to disappear
3) you have the feeling of being refreshed in your back pocket / bag
4) very well
5) well, it's more that he can drink if he wants to
6) nothing! first:
1) the fact I hate the way you've not just said temperature as if you're instant messaging a mate
2) who the copywriter is who thinks saying the word ""temp"" is cool
3) see above
4) yes. Plus ""now"" - it's not now, because these types of flasks have been in the market for years.
5) I like the image but it could be zoomed in slightly or show a zoomed in version of the person drinking alongside this one

second:
I genuinely can't think of anything I would improve about this, it works by far the best for me. Maybe the image could show his face or show him from the front with someone? First:

I would make it: The perfect temperature is sustainable / The perfect drink is always possible.
Get rid of ""now"" and spell temperature properly
I like the image but maybe you could include multiple people in this scale of image

Second:

As I've said before I really like this one because the image is good and the wording is quite deep and philosophical but simple. You could change the image by adding another person or showing the person's face but its not that big of a deal First:

1) simple, playful, active, fun
2) portability is the best thing about this product
3) showing that you can take this flask anywhere, especially fun days out when you don't have a bag, and have fresh consistent drink, whatever it is.
4) it's good, despite being a bit non-specific with the word 'stays' in isolation it communicates something easy and fun well
5) well, I like the scale: close but with context. could probably find a hotter place though and someone looking more natural whilst taking a branding selfie
6) can't think of much

Second:

1) pretentious, elusive, sleek, misaligned, confusing
2) people who have these flasks are rebellious and lean out of car windows? I guess it's got the vibe of heading home after an active day out so it's suggesting the end of the day is as good as the start, just like your drink
3) the idea you can experience the same thing at the end of the day using this product as at the start through whatever you are drinking
4) I like it, despite the fact it doesn't refer explicitly to drink
5) not well, I don't get it. It would be good to see their face and I just don't know why you would ever put yourself in that position, let alone with a flask
6) change the image First:

1) I like it. the photo is a bit forced though
2) it makes you think about where you could go with the flask
3) photo is forced
4) I like the wording, although maybe there is a way of referring explicitly to the drink? I assume this is deliberate though and I do think it works as it focuses on the product not the drink inside it.
5) it's good but a bit forced as nobody would ever take that selfie unless they were posing for an advert

Second:
1) silly photo. words don't necessarily make it clear you're speaking about a drink especially with the photo
2) temperature of what? who is this girl? why is she leaning out the window with her flask?
3) see above
4) yes I don't think is terrible to imply it's about the drink but some people might be a bit confused if you don't have it with the right photo which really drives home the drink and flask idea
5) see above First: this is one of my favourites because it isn't explicit in its wording but it focuses on the flask as a portable accessory; I just think it could be improved by making the flask a bit more subtle in its placement. The focus on the flask itself and not the drink inside it is good because it won't isolate people who haven't decided how they want to use the flask yet. For example I mostly use my flask for cold drinks and barely ever for hot, but I didn't know this prior to buying one.

Second: the disparity between the words and the image here is the worst part because you need something more explicitly about the flask/drink if you are only going to be implicit in the writing. The image needs to go; replace it with something implying its the end of the day and you're travelling home but be more explicit about the fact it's about the drink: someone on the train home or in the backseat holding it laughing with friends First ad:

1) comfort, bliss, absolute comfort, you can be out and about and experience being refreshed using this flask
2) that an unequivocally positive experience is available to you at all times 
3) same as (2) - she is taking a break from her walk and enjoying the facility of the flask
4) well because this idea of an available/accessible feeling, for me, is the crux of what a good portable flask provides
5) Quite well as she looks like she needs a long drink after walking for a while, but it could zoom out and provide more context about what she is doing
6) more than one image showing her at different stages of the day? like packing it at the start and emptying it at the end of the day?

Second ad:

1) i love coffee (!!), but i don't ""take"" coffee, comfort zone, bliss, exaggerated
2) for those who drink coffee this flask can allow you to engineer you having a portable coffee whenever you like. ""take"" it implies you're being served it which is potentially clever but I think a bit over the top
3) you're targeting coffee lovers without really including much suitable coffee imagery
4) I guess quite well as people like their coffees at different temperatures
5) not well, I drink coffee with my eyes open, in a place I am clearly in need of it 
6) speak to coffee lovers; show her sat down chilling with her eyes open First:

1) Pure is a bit vague. I want to see more context about her entire day, not just her stood wherever she is
2) where she is, what she has been doing, how do you know that i value the same type of refreshment?
3) I think ""pure"" refreshment just sounds a bit cringe and vague but the notion of having it all day is good. the image needs to match this better though
4) pure. all day long is a bit explicit but the concept is good
5) No negative connotations but it's not that good because we don't see context and I want the idea of her having it all day long expressed somehow. Maybe two images; show time elapsing.

Second:

1) As a coffee lover I don't feel like it's speaking to me. I drink coffee wide awake, sat down, and from an open cup so I can properly make sure I don't burn my tongue
2) why is coffee being presented as the central drink here when she looks like she is drinking something that is cooling her down
3) I know you ""take"" coffee but it is just trying a bit hard. Plus ""take"" is more about style than temperature.
4) as above
5) she's facing away, I have no idea where she is, I want to see context. I enjoy drinking coffee in particular contexts so show those contexts to me and it will resonate First:

I would just say: Refreshment. All day long. - and then have two photos, one of her packing her flask at the start of her day, and then as she is in the middle of her walk. I would therefore zoom out and have more context around her to make sure we understand she has been able to enjoy the feeling of refreshment at different stages of the day.

Second:

Words: Top-up on coffee whenever you like. My impression is that, especially if you're using this flask whilst active, you will probably drink coffee as a top up. Also I would zoom out, show some scenery, have someone sat down (even if they are on a walk; say on a bench or on the grass or a rock) taking a break, eyes open, enjoying the awoken warmth coffee gives you. This picture looks like someone drinking cold water to rehydrate which is fine for another drink reference. Concept S. I like the word sustainable, it implies someone relaxed and at one with nature, and I think the imagery is attractive. I want to get out of the city and be using a flask whilst I walk so sign me up. That being said lots of people would use it for the city or suburban contexts, as I do most of the time, so this cohort might be isolated by the rural focus of the images in this. But maybe this would just mean the flask targets people wanting to spend time in the great outdoors which is something I crave and I think would value having specific accessories to tackle.",Splash,
301028,Kat,Habibi,katharina.r.habibi@gmail.com,"Concepts A
1. The images look pleasant, the product is interesting 
2. I like the colours, the beautiful setting, the fun/care free mood
    I am not sure about the text, the wording

Concepts R
1. Attractive product, ‘normal setting’
2. For me the pictures work with the text, the focus seems more on the sensual experience of drinking as an act but I would prefer it if the text was funnier, more clever. 

Concept S
1. Very nice photos, slightly strange text, product looks appealing 
2. I like the beautiful shots and the claims of sustainability are positive 

3. I would want to know how these bottles are insulated, how come they are different to ‘normal’ thermal bottles Concepts A
Kalt: Die Temperatur bleibt gleich, egal wohin Du gehst. -> I just added ‘gleich’ as it emphasises keeping the temperature the ‘same’. 
Heiß: Ende den Tag mit der gleichen Temperatur wie am Anfang

Concepts R
Kalt: Pure Erfrischung den ganzen Tag lang.
Heiß: Kaffee bleibt so, wie Du ihn trinkst.

Concepts S
Kalt: Die perfekte Temperatur ist jetzt nachhaltig
Heiß: Erfrischung ist nachhaltig 1. It makes me think of outdoors activities; holidays, not everyday situations 
2. That the way the temperatures are staying cold or hot is easy and improved
3. Keeping the temperature as it is for a long time
4. The words are not completely explaining what the temperature has to do with sustainability 
5. While the images are beautiful, they don’t show someone enjoying a hot drink in a cold setting and  vice versa.
6. Maybe to see the hotness/ the steam  of the coffee/tea would make it more obvious 

1-4 above apply to the second one as well

5. The photo is beautiful but it doesn’t seem especially hot or the woman doesn’t seem too bothered about the drink. 

6.
Maybe her silhouette should be shown in front of this setting, drinking refreshing water The link between sustainability and the keeping of the temperature is not really clear. 
How long does it keep drinks hot? Of cold? How is this bottle different to other bottles? 
I am not sure about the  ‘temp’ abbreviation. 

The pictures show beautiful places in the world, that an environmentally conscious person would like to keep alive. So the sustainability link is understandable. But maybe it is too much to combine the sustainable factor with the task of refreshment. 

There no negative emotions regarding the images! But maybe it works for more people to see everyday settings. The ‘enlightened’ (and maybe actually lit up) person having a sip from a hydro flask in the sea of people with their throw away cups... people start noticing how horrible this is. I would have the person have a break or let her drink a sip and by showing the steam, it’s clear the drink is still hot. 
This way the words translate to the image more than now. 

Maybe even show the ugly reality with all the plastic in the water. Saying refreshment is sustainable would then be very meaningful and not just a nice phrase. 1.A bottled drink that remains enjoyable, being outdoorsy, being environmentally conscious 
2. The insulated bottle keeps the contents cool. (Well it kind of says so)
3. Keeping the drink at the right temperature for longer in a ‘green’ bottle 
4. Both wording and image convey this message.
5. Maybe she wouldn’t show the bottle but use it, drink it and look genuinely refreshed.

1. Road trip, adventure, a practical bottle to keep hot drinks hot 
2. The bottle keeps the hot drink as hot as when it was made. Even when it’s cold outside.
3. The hot drink doesn’t get cold, the bottle is very useful when being out/ mobile.
4. Both image and the wording work and convey the idea.
5. 
I like it the way it is. But maybe she would also take a sip rather than just holding the bottle. Because she is just holding, showing the bottle, it’s not emphasizing the practicalities/ usefulness. Do we believe that she really wants to drink the allegedly refreshing drink? 
I think if the viewer sees how she is refreshed, the urge to have one of these might be greater. Most people (who are not millennials) don’t identify necessarily with a selfie/posing person. But maybe this is for the younger kids? 

The second one is more appealing in my eyes. The only thing I would change might be the sip of the drink rather than holding it. The wording works combining it with a person who is happily drinking from this bottle and having a refreshing sip. It might just be me but I would not use the selfie style of the photo. 

As said before, I would just propose that she takes a sip. Other than that, it’s good. 1. Drinking, Active lifestyle, environmentally conscious, usefulness 
2.  Reusing these bottles is sustainable, it’s practical and the drink’s temperature stays the same. 
3. Maintaining the temperature of the drink in a eco friendly bottle 
4. The words in the first one are not conveying the fact fully. The second is on point. 
5. The images are okay but the second one looks more like she is drinking it straight in a cafe. 
6. It might be better to show drinking a hot drink somewhere more remote. Or on the go. I often make a coffee to take with me but it’s cold soon. The ‘pure’ aspect is not really ideal. Why would it it’s purity change? I think Germans don’t ‘fall’ for purity and clean living as much. But if it was straight about its coolness/ freshness, that would be better. So I would focus on how it keeps the drink cool and fresh tasting. 
The image is good, it looks like an active person having a refreshing sip. 

With the second example, it’s more the other way around. The wording makes sense, the coffee stays the way you take it. Maybe add for how long, if it’s remarkable how long.
But the image is not ideal to emphasize this temperature longevity. I don’t have any negative feelings about it though, it looks like a nice coffee moment. But as I said before, I would show someone on the move rather than in this close up shot. The wording in the first one I would change to Cool (and maybe tasty?) refreshment all day. The photo is fine although it might not hurt also showing non- sporty looking people. As everyone has or will have their flask, it’s just a matter of time. And it could also be an older lady on the bench. Or a nerdy looking middle-aged man on the train. 

The wording is good, I would use a photo of someone who is busy and shown in that busy setting but taking a moment to finally sip her still-hot- coffee. Maybe a parent on the school run. Concept A - hot. It’s the more attractive one in many ways and in Germany it might be more apt to worry about hot drinks not getting cold. 

Concept R- cold - it’s the better one out of these two. The way she sips from the bottle looks genuine and makes me want a bottle too.

Concept S - cold 
Again, it’s usually more cold in Germany and I dislike it when my hot drinks get cold.",Splash,
301030,Asami,Tamagawa,8appy1ucky3usic@gmail.com,"1. healthy, easy to take with
2. What I like; gives us the impression that it keeps the temperature longer and fresh
What I do not like; the picture of HOT in conceptA. The lady look like she is throwing it away from the car.
3. What else of HOT drink can we put in except coffee? 
I also like to know the temp like 6 to 8hours after  I put the drink in. 1.Concepts A:Cold;どこに行っても同じ温度で　 Hot;1日の最後の温度は朝の温度と同じ

2.tried to give them simple but easy to understand and also how sustainable the tumbler is. 1.whatever the drink I pour in the morning is keepable til the night.
2.The temperature of the drink; Cold or Hot
3. This tumbler can sustain the temp of any drink and its freshness
4. I think everyone can understand the main idea, so it is very understanding.
5. The left picture should be more clear
6.; About the left pic; we catch the mountain at first sight so snow and person should be focused more
if you want advertise the tumbler which can keep the hot temp.
Overall;The people on the picture had better drink with the satisfied face. There is no provable information at all. 1. The pictures. It is not proved that the words on advertisement is true or not at all.
2.How long does the temperature keep?
3.refreshment is hard to sustain
4.I feel weird to see ""Now"" in the left concept. That is because there have been many tumblers which can have the same function.
5. There could be more better to give an impression about the concept. 1. left; change the wording and imagery. Right; change the imagery
2. left; a. and b. 
 For the wording, deleting ""Now"" and adding more information about the sustainable time; for example, all day or till the nigh and so on.
For the imagery, it should be more snowed and the person should be a bit closer and they had better have tumbler with.
   right; b the person should be pictured when they are drinking and feeling fresh and they maybe had better be with a couple of people because it looks fun 1. This tumbler is  good to take for a one-day trip or out.
2. It can keep the temperature for almost 12hours.
3. temperature at night is the same as it was in the morning
4. well
5. well but not great
6 the fact(proof); because if you mention about the number like temperature, people would believe the advertisement with proof. 1.For me , it is photo in the right
2.I came up with this question: for how long is the temperature kept?
3. the right picture
4. no i think it is ok
5. I have no idea what the women in the right picture is trying to do. 1. I think I change to the pic of both.
2.a. I maybe add the wording on the left, for example, ""The temperature stays with young matter where you go""
b. I change the pic of her with other friends of her too because it looks more fun(left)
I change this to  the picture of person who is drinking near the camping fire with their smile. 1. This tumbler is needed in our daily life
2. It can keep the drink I put in this tumbler all the time
3. Whenever you have it, it tastes the same as when you put in.
4. I think very well
5. I think great
6.  For left, I would like to see her in sport wear to enhance refreshment 1.Left; it says all day long but the pic looks like it is in the morning so people might doubt it / Right; It only mentions about coffee.
2.Left;Is it really all day long? / Right; What about the other hot drinks?
3.Left; nothing Right; nothing
4.Left; nothing Right; coffee goes bad as time goes so I feel weird
5.Left; it is good Right; she had not better drink but hold it with the lid open with steam 1.Left; I would change the picture / Right; I would change the word  
2.a. I would change to ""taste stays the way you take it""(right concept) because coffee should not be the only drink to put
b. I would change to the evening photo(left)because it can prove a bit more of the word ""all day long"" Concept A 
Because now in Japan, the young people love photogenic things or selfie.
This concept gives them an impression or motivates them  that they go somewhere with this tumbler and take photogenic pic to upload to their SNS",Splash,
301031,Tatsuhiro,Tsukada,tatsuhirotsukada@yahoo.co.jp,"1. I like concept A because these pics much your items.
2. Concept S made me confused about the concept of your items.
3. I want to know more about how much are those and how long do they keep coldness and heat. A-cold :いつでもどこでも同じ温度
A-hot: 1日の終わりまで変わらない温度
No variation from the English. 

R-cold: 1日中フレッシュ
R-hot: いつまでもあなた好みのコーヒーの温度を提供します
No variation from the English. 

S-cold: 完璧な温度管理を実現
“Make the perfect sustainable temperature a reality” 
By adding the final two characters(reality/realize), it makes the phrase sound more natural
S-hot: 新鮮さまでもが持続する
No variation from English. 1a. Why did they chose this picture? 
    Not meant for daily use, only for professionals/adventurers 
    Looks expensive 
    Not sure of difference between this product and other products in the market (Japan has many products similar to this already) 
2a. It’s an expensive thermos. 
3a. Keep the same temperature no matter where you go. 
4a. Well. 
5a. Not well. I think a mountain road is better. 
6a. Change the picture to make concept more clear, or to relate better to concept. 

1b. Seems more like for daily use. 
    I like the shape of the thermos. 
2b. It’s thermal. Can go anywhere for daily use. 
3b. Same as above. 
4b. Not well. 
5b. Well. 
6b. Changing the wording to imply how or why refreshment is sustainable would be good. 1a. Overall design doesn’t work well. 
2a. Who is the target? 
3a. Bottle color makes it seem like it’s only for cold drinks. 
4a. Not sure about English. 
5a. Depending on who the target is it could be changed. For mountain climbers okay but for daily use another pic is better. 

1b. It’s fine. 
2b. Same as above. 
3b. Color. Needs variations. 
4b. Not sure about English. 
5b. Picture and bottle shape are as good as can be. 1a. Make more color variations. Change the design so it’s simpler or cuter to appeal to Japanese market (ie: cherry blossom pattern). Change the picture to something of the bottle being used in different situations. 
2a-a. Not sure about English. 
2a-b. Change the background to something not blue and change the picture to a mountain road or one of the product being used. 

1b. I think it is good the way it is. If it were being advertised in Japan, using English on the advertisement would be cooler than using the Japanese. 
2b-a. English is cooler than the Japanese, so if being advertised here I recommend to use just English
2b-b. I think this is ok. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
A. It looks like really comfortable to carry wherever i want to go. 
B.concept is well matching .


What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
A.It implies me that is really light. 
B.it  is smaller tgan i thought from the picture on the right side.

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
A.Keep the temperature well.
B.same as above

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
A.It is good.
B.i like A more.

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
A.I also like the picture. It matches the idea.
B.im worried about the picture  that japanese people do not do.

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
A.B. It is really good that i think, but just wondering does it have only one color variation or not. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
A&B. It doesnt work well on me because I alreaady have some of these things.


What questions does it raise?
A&B.Japan already has lots of similar products, so what is the strength and differences from others?


What things do you disagree with? 
A. No disagreement 
B. Should change the picture. It looks dangerous.


Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Aq&B. No problem !


What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
A.it is rely good like ""oh. I want one."" Kind.
B. Nothing special. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
A&B. Mainly no change is fine, but if you wanna sell it in japan, you should have more variation of color or designs. Or maling extra outfit for the bottles. then changing design is easily and never get tired to keep it.


What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?

Changes to the wording?
A&B. Im not sure about english 
Changes to the imagery?
A.japan doesnt sell this kind of bottles, so it workes well in japan. However you should tell why is the shape of the bottle is good. Japanese wants to know the reason why i bought it (seasonal, usuful, rare, etc...)

B. It is so normal, soi wanna have color variations and others designs. 1a. Makes the drink inside look more delicious 
   Meant for everyday use 

2a. By using this your drink will always be good 

3a. Same as above 

4a. I’m not sure about the English 

5a. Well 

6a. I think that the advertisement is okay the way it is because the language is simple and the image goes well with the concept. 

1b. Hard to understand for ESL, and hard to translate 

2b. I’m not sure about English, but it looks like it makes your drink taste better. 

3b. Enjoy your coffee the way you like it. 

4b. Not sure about the English. 

5b. Well 

6b. I would make the sentence simpler and easy to understand for people who do not speak English as their native language because it is difficult to understand what “take your coffee” means. The picture is ok the way it is because the girl looks like she is enjoying her drink. 1a. The girls clothes. It makes me wonder what she is drinking and what she is doing. 
2a. The color of the advertisement and her clothes. 
3a. No
4a. Imagery could be better, but no negative feelings. 

1b. It doesn’t look like she’s drinking coffee for me. It also makes me wonder what it means to take coffee 
2b. The wording 
3b. “Take your coffee” — I don’t understand this nuance
4b. It could be better but it doesn’t have negative feelings 1a. I would put the girl on the beach or somewhere hot.The color of the advertisement is blue so it makes me think she is drinking something cold, so it would be better if she were on the beach instead of drinking something cold when it is cold out side. 
2a. Wording is okay. 
3a. Change the image to something that looks warmer 

1b. Maybe if she was getting coffee from a coffee shop it would be better because she is “taking” coffee. It can also make the picture more action
2b. Make the wording easier for ESL people 
3b. Someone getting coffee from the shop or barista Absolutely A.
The wording  sounds more natural than the others.
Also i like the pictures more compared to the other concepts (R and S).
Maybe because it is easy to imagine for daily use..",Splash,
301735,Marvin,Deckelmann,,"If I have to choose between all those 3 concepts, I would choose concept A, because it integrates the action of going on an adventure with beautiful landscapes and you can relate immediately to a much more complete experience rather than concept R, for example, that it is a very generic stock image and you can't really think about an experience. Concept S, to me, is more about the beautiful landscape but you can't really relate to the drink. Concept A
Frío - La temperatura se queda, no importa a dónde vayas.
Caliente - Termina tu día con la temperatura con la que empezaste.
It can be well explained in both languages. I get the whole idea.

Concept R
Frío - Frescura pura durante todo el día.
Caliente - El café se queda como lo tomas.
I get the idea and it wasn't that hard to translate it.

Concept S
Frío - Ahora la temperatura perfecta es sostenible.
Caliente - La frescura es sostenible.
I think the concept in here is a little bit more ambiguous, and its not that clear, 'cause to me sustainable is a much more deep concept. For me sustainability is the balance between the human being and his environment. To care, protect and take actions in order to protect and preserve the environment we live in. 
When I see these both images, it brings me to mind that there's no need to use containers, plastic, unicel or other materials that pollute the environment, in order to live in perfect balance with nature. You can have either hot and cold drinks without being a polluting factor.
I think it implies also in a very subtle way that these containers are made of sustainable or recycled material that does not hurt our environment. 
The main idea for the concept I think is being aware of what surround us and being able to explore it with the right bottle and the right temperature, which is very important for a good experience outdoors, enjoying a good drink. 
I like the simplicity of having few words in it, like I think is very on point and you can relate cause the images are impressive and the landscapes are beautiful. I think it doesnt work for me that I dont really know what theyre selling. As I said in my last answer, I could have implied that it is a sustainable product based on recycled material, so thats why it is sustainable. But I really don't know for sure.
It raises those questions to me. Is it 100% sustainable? What is the bottle made of? Are they selling the experience of a new technology that really keeps it hot and cold? But whats the difference between this bottle and other bottles in the market? 
As I also said before, sustainable to me is very ambiguous and can have a lot of different meanings. I would like the approach to be a little bit clearer because, to me, there's a lot of guessing. 
The imagery is good because it is impressive. It really takes you to that place and that experience. Although, I think in the first image, the bottle could be a little bit closer, cause its too far and it doesn't integrate with the whole concept or idea. I think it could work better to explain in few words a goodness of the product. Like, how is this bottle different from the others? What are those advantages of buying this bottle? Like, whats the innovative goodness of it? How can I have a benefit? 
Is it the taste? The temperature? The commitment with the environment? I think I need a little bit more, like ""100%...."" or ""We're the number 1 in...."" You know, something that really describes a whole different concept from the other bottles in the market. 
The imagery, as I said, could be a little bit more about an experience, or people reactions, like capturing the feeling and the sensations of people really enjoying the product, rather than just showing a nice landscape or a nice spot somewhere. I think I understand this concept much more. It gets clearer because what youre selling is really the temperature. And that is a big goodness of your bottle.
It is implied that the temperature is what youre caring the most, and as a consumer that's very important, because having the right temperature changes the whole experience when you're hot or cold. 
The main idea is having the right temperature in the right moment, in the right place. That's it.
The wording is good to me. On point.
And the imagery, on the first one you can see the reaction of the girl and you can relate to it. I would like to see in the second image a facial expression, as to me, that changes the whole idea, even though the action expresses adventure and fun. So, in relation to the last question, that's something I would like to see enhanced. It doesn't work to me, that you're only showing one experience. If you're saying ""no matter where you go"", it could have worked showing 2 or more spots, enhancing the idea of really ""everywhere"".
It raises questions like: ""How can this bottle keeps the right temperature?"" ""Is it the material it is made of?"" ""How can you say it is different from other bottles?""
I disagree on the second image, for example, of not showing a facial expression cause to me thats relating to the main subject that's having the experience. If the girl is too cold, why does she is not dressed correctly? It doesnt make sense to me that she's implying to be cold but she's just with a simple sweater, you know. 
I like the wording. To me it works, it is clever and on point. I would add some goodness of the product, like ""100% something..."" or ""The only one in the market...."" I want to know how does this product protects temperature. Whats the big difference on time? Like, the other bottles stay hot or cold for this long, ""but our product stays this much more longer in the right temperature"".
I could have chosen a much more hot environment and a much more cold environment, not only in the landscape selection, but like in a scene. A much more specific action which we can relate more of really enjoying the ""temperature experience"" which is a huge deal when you're travelling. I don't like this idea that much, 'cause I get that you're trying to sell temperature, as in refreshment or hotness. And that's what I'm implying, but I don't get related to the images, because they're very closed up and you can't really see an experience. I mean the girl's facial expressions are good, but you cant notice the environment and the situation of the weather.
The main idea, again, is temperature. Enjoying the right temperature.
The wording is clever but I don't see a relation between the words and the images. The actions are quite basic and I would like to see a little bit more of a landscape. Its all about the balance and not having a very tight shot that doesn't show that much. It doesn't work to me, as I said, the images and not being able to place the situation. It can be everywhere, and I guess, for the temperature you're selling, it can work OK, but its not that impressive. I need something more. Its just a nice girl drinking... Where is she drinking it? We don't know that. And for me, that changes the whole experience. 
I like the first wording, but as for the second one, I would have chosen something like ""Coffee stays the way you like it"". It relates to something you enjoy and you like to have on your daily basis. ""Pure refreshment all day long"" maybe, more into ""The refreshment you always need"" and the imagery could be the same girl but really enjoying the refreshment in a hot place, or after exercising. Placing the situation is important to me, because hikers, bikers, sport people can relate more to. In a gym, on the beach, in a sports competition. I mean, not just having the girl drinking a bottle of water, more like, really having the girl refreshing herself.
It works exactly the same for the second image, which I like the least, cause it doesnt show really the place or the situation where you can really enjoy a cold drink. Maybe reading, maybe working, maybe at the office, at school, in a cold mountain... Where can I, as a consumer, enjoy this ""marvelous"" temperature? Concept A, definitely.

You get the idea of the temperature and that's exactly what you're selling. I think that is exactly what makes the difference between your brand and the other bottles. Now that I got to read more of your product, the portability, the strength, the easy-carry comfort and your insulated technology of really keeping the right temperature are best enhanced in the concept A, because the wording is clearer and you can see an experience of outdoors, happiness, and people really integrating your product into their routines, adventure or daily activities.",Splash,INFP
301025,Joey,Oster,Missjoster@gmail.com,"Concepts A reminds me of instagram posts. I like the sense of fun and andventure. I don’t like the words on this concept. 
Concepts R I find quite boring and wouldn’t take much notice of the ad. I have no connection to the pictures.  However I do like the words on this concept. 
Concept S is my favourite and standout. The words resonate with me and the environment. 
I find all the concepts overpowered in blue and the blue side too large. 

The concepts explain about the bottle.  The flask keeps the contents hot/ cold even when there is extreme temperature differences. It isn’t bad for the environment. 
Implies that is reusable and therefore not as bad for the environment and it’s versatile in all temperatures. 
A flask that doesn’t cost the earth and keeps the temperature as it was when put in the flask. 
Imagery matches the wording very well with Athen natural environment
I would like to see the comparison of using the flask compared to single use cups/ bottle. There could be a pile of cups in the corner to emphasise how much waste the flask could save. The size of the “blue side” is very overwhelming and takes away from looking at the images. 
Does the flask give you a hot hand is that why it is being held in the snow 
 I like the wording. 
The pictures show how versatile the flask is and shows the variance in temperatures. I would certainly halve the blue side so it’s 1/4 blue and 3/4 imagery. 
I would also put the flask in a different place in the snow. She looks so casual trekking in the snow and why is she holding it?
I wouldn’t change anything else, I like this concept. The thoughts that it’s a flask for the young and carefree to use. 
Main concept is need to use a flask and this is the one while out on your adventures.  I feel it is targeted to the 20’s and travellers.  Imagery conveys that’s its only for people who excercise or are in the outdoors. Definitely the younger crowd.  It’s very on trend for the younger market as it looks like what you would see on Instagram. 
I don’t believe the hot concept is conveyed well at all as she is in the snow with her jumper rolled up. 
The wording doesn’t match the pictures and in hotyou can’t tell it’s in the evening or the liquid has been in there all day. 
The hot flask imagery needs to be a little realistic, maybe sitting around a fire drinking from it. Doesn’t work well as it’s younger generation focussed. 
The hot imagery doesn’t really convey much as it’s hard to tell it’s in the cooler climate because of what she is wearing. 
I feel the wording is fine but the picture doesn’t match as it doesn’t look like the evening. 
Only negative is that is targeted towards a younger generation I would add a male in the pictures. It’s very female focused which limits the market. 
I would definitely change the bottom picture to a group of people in the snow around a fire drinking from the flask. 
I don’t think the wording and pictures match up in the bottom picture. That this flask is what you need for a workout and after. You only need 1 flask for your hot and cold beverages for the whole day. 
It implies that this flask can take you through the whole day and through all activities. 
The wording matches the imagery very well. 
I think the concept is very clear in this concept. The concept doesn’t work well in that is focuses on being used for fitness activity. 
The question is why does she need to put coffee in this. It’s like a coffee/ flask ad but I couldn’t imagine drinking coffee from it. 
I wouldn’t use a flask like this to take coffee around as I wouldn’t take coffee from home out. 
It’s another female based ad so it implies it’s for females only. I would put a male and female walking together. 
In Australia the people that take coffee in flasks would be taxi drivers or truck drivers. The target of a young lady doesn’t match what we do here as we buy coffee out. For example there could have been an Uber driver with the flask and the last in the back. Concept s as people are always trying to do less damage to the environment and have items that are reusable.  To limit the amount of plastic bottles people use this would be a great option 
Lots of people exercise in the outdoors  and spend lots of time outside. Camping is also popular along with road trips and the flask would be great.",Splash,
301027,Alex,Neuschaefer,alnehq@gmail.com,"Concept R is my favorite by far, because:
- it is short and reduced to the most important aspect, the function (keeping drinks hot/cold). That is the main thing that interests me in a water bottle, that it does it´s job; keeping drinks fresh or hot wherever I go. everything else (focus on environment/sustainability, for active/adventurous people etc..) can better be conveyed through photos.
- concept A: IMO there is an imbalance between photo and text; The text feels quite modest and almost restrained compared to the photos of sportive, active, adventurous people. 
- concept S: Refreshment is sustainable.. doesn´t make much sense to me.. I get that it´s supposed to talk to people that use plastic bottles, but it´s not clear in what way hydroflask is more sustainable than other bottles on the market. more information would be needed here; maybe some text with the key facts about why the production of hydroflask would be more environmentally friendly. But after seeing just this, I´m not curious to know more..

but maybe it has to do with the layout..I´m not sure this combination of photo and monochrome background with product and text works to be honest. I find it to be distracting, because I can´t view it all at once, I have to go from left to right.. one image with everything in it would be better I think A: Wohin du auch gehst: die Temperatur bleibt konstant / Beende den Tag mit der gleichen Temperatur wie du ihn begonnen hast (sounds weird; but also in english.. it´s a weird slogan to be honest. First I was thinking it relates to body temperature? Of the woman in the photo?)
R: Pure Erfrischung, den ganzen Tag lang / Der Kaffee bleibt genauso wie du ihn gemacht hast
S: Die perfekte Temperatur ist nachhaltig. / Erfrischung ist nachhaltig (cringe..) 1+2: does it mean the bottle keeps the temperature? so it stays warm even in the snow, where the guy in the photo is walking past? I get that you want me to know that it´s somehow better for the environment, but I don´t get any information from a photo of a guy on a hike with trees, so I stop thinking further about it. Give me more info about how it´s better for the environment!
3. is it about the environment? active lifestyle? I don´t really know...
4. not very well. But slogans with a wordplay in it have to be really really good and precise; otherwise they quickly sound bad
5. not well. An image of a nice place outside doesn´t give me the association of ""good for the environment"". It´s just a photo of a nice place..
6. If hydroflask is somehow good for the environment then I would really like to know in what way.. so more text would be great. Oldschool advertisement like in the 50s in a way.. product information instead of wanting to trigger emotional associations 1. opposition of product/text/monochrome and photo without text is too harsh. because I don´t see much connection between the two
2. whats the connection between slogan and photo of a nice place outside
3. nothing to disagree with.. it´s just not reaching me
4. I´m notsure what the message is.. apart from ""sustainability"" being kinda a hip word right now 
5. I think the opposition of two images (monochrome and photo) doesn´t work, at least it doesn´t reach me. it´s confusng beacuse I have to first look left and read, then look right and try to find a connection between text and photo 1: one image, full photo backgroud, bottle left or center, slogan on top. or with second image: the same, but more text about how it´s actually environmentally friendly.
2. hm no idea; maybe with the right image make the slogan a bit more cheeky/sassy; it sounds very tame. Or, enlarge the photos so we see the facial expressions of the people! Right now they appear like staffage for the nice landscape.. 1. (left) active Lifestyle - on the go - bottle keeps my drinks cool because it seems to be hot in the photo - I should go on a hike again  - so is this an insulated bottle? - (right) this better be an english car with the steering wheel on the left, otherwise this is really not safe - she is only wearing a sweater so it must be hot in the car - so her drink is also warm because of the car heating, not because of the bottle - really nice vw bus  - she will drop the bottle an has to go back to pick it up again
2. (left) it implies that the bottle keeps the drink cold in hot weather. I would be thinking it´s an insulated bottle -(right) you can have hot coffee in cold climates
3. (both) a temperature keeping/isolated bottle is necessary for a ´sporty, active adventurous lifestyle
4. (left) good, no questions -(right) a bit weird wordplay in there. which temperature do you mean? my body temperature?
5.(left) ok, but maybe she ispresenting the bottle a bit too much. it looks a bit like "" hey, look at this cool bottle. it´s an ad!""
(right) - again, this better be a british car... otherwise nice
6. I think it might be better to focus more on the landscape and climate than on pretty faces and people doing crazy stuff.. 1. (left and right) link between photo and image is not clear 
2.(left) - is this an insulated bottle? (right) is she steering the car with her feet? what does the ""temperature"" refer to?
3. i don´t understand the question...
4 . ""finish the day with the temperature you started"" sounds confusing. when I only see the left half with bottle and text then it´s clear, but the photo makes it a bit weird. could be also an ad for a new car heating
5. (right) well.. the woman steering the car with her feet maybe take the photo of the guy walking in the snowy forest.. I think the bottle doesn´t have to appear so big in the photo because it´s already so big in the left half. the photo section could just be a photo of some cold snowy landscape with someone hiking.. or even no person at all. it´s more to set a mood.. 
the wording on the right ad I would definitely change, also the photo. maybe just: finish the day with the drink temperature from the morning 1. (left) active lifestyle - what drink is she having? - patagonia makes nice outdoor vests - I´m thirsty - bottle has good size 
(right) dreamy sunny moment  - is her nose touching the bottle? - a handy bottle to keep my coffee warm, thats nice
2. (left) she seems to be jogging/ doing running - where does shekeep the bottle when she´s running... 
(right) you always have hot coffee with you
3. (left) cold water all day long, especially during sports
(right) less focus on sports, more casual, having a bottle that accompanies you everywhere, all the time
4. (left) Idk if the ""pure"" is a good choice here.. itdepends what is in the bottle. maybe emphasize the keeping cold somehow
(right) i like it. short and precise
4. (left) good.. except that I am almost more interested in the cool patagonia vest now
(right) I like it, it has a good mood, very calm, good composition. fits to the calm composition of the blue half of the image 1. (left) in the photo, you see no logo on the bottle but on the vest
(right I see no weakness here
2.(left) how does the lid work? (right) same
3. i don´t know..
4. (left) ""pure refreshment"" in my head would refer more to the content of the bottle; like if its an ad for a mineral water
5. no obvious negatives 1.(left) change the wording, hide the vest logo, show the bottle logo 
(right) I wouldn´t change a thing
2.a (left) ""keeps your drinks refreshing all day long"".. (right) I wouldn´t change a thing, it´s short and not unnecessarily cheeky, informative (tells you what the bottle does best).minimal and honest, without hiding behind forced humor
2.b. (left) hide the vest logo, show the bottle logo. otherwise fine, I can see she likes her drink concept r but with some tweaking..
I would take the photo from concept s (cold) and write ""the perfect temperature, all day long"". But I´m no advertising pro...
the photo in its composition refers to paintings of the romantic era.. human alone in the wilderness which mirrors his soul.. It´s not so much about young hip trendy people but more about nature, activities, being alone doing what you want; freedom. the (hot) ad is just a beautifully sunny morning coffee moment. and who doesn´t like that?",Splash,
296556,Kate ,Manning ,Katiemaree@gmail.com,"They are all very literal rather than ‘catchy’. Maybe a little dry in tone. I like how simple the image and plain blue block is. I definitely prefer the ones that talk about taste over sustainability. Sustainable should be a given or an added bonus, not the main purpose.  The concept implies the bottle is for outdoor adventures. For people who enjoy and care about nature and our environment. The people look fit/thin so I link it to healthy, fit, in shape people. 
The main idea is that the bottle is environmentally friendly - you can have your drink and look after the environment at the same time. I think the first one ‘perfect temp’ makes sense to me because I completed the phase one research. Maybe test it on people who don’t know about the campaign. I don’t think it’s clear. Maybe it needs a byline. The second one is more clear because refreshment is another word for drink so it reads simply as having a drink/using that bottle equals being more sustainable. 
The top one makes me think of outdoor adventures. It doesn’t make me automatically think ‘hot drink’ which is why the top message is perhaps not overt enough. Plus I think you often still have cool drinks when doing outdoor activities in cold as you get thirst if hiking or snowboarding even if cold, the hot drink would be for after you’ve finished. 
The second pic makes me think of water and therefore assume there is water in the bottle. The top one does not give me a mental picture of what’s in the flask. I assume it’s something warm, but I don’t know what so I don’t connect with it. Again, with the top one I can’t see/imagine what is in the flask. 
The word sustainable is too serious. Can it be more catchy or casual, like ‘think green’ or ‘eco warrior’? 
The imagery is strong. They both paint the picture of people engaging in physical activity and would therefore need a drink. They both show our natural environment which we need to protect. Overall, the bottom one works for me. The wording could be a little more catchy but otherwise it’s great - the pic works with the text, I know what I’m buying. 
With the top one, I think my main issue is I don’t link warm drinks with physical activity. I love the photo but maybe it needs to be a more passive activity, like camping or fishing, still showing a cold climate and beautiful landscape. The perfect temp is sustainable feels like you’re trying to convey two messages in one and it’s not quite working for me. Perhaps it needs to be longer - eg. Keep warm and look after nature with the sustainable hydro flask. Obviously not that, I’m sure a copywriter could do something amazing, but just that I don’t think it’s the temp that is sustainable, it’s the bottle that is sustainable, so I get stuck on the top slogan. The top one is really fun. The model is happy and clearly having fun. She’s sporty and outdoors, and the bottle appears a trusty companion. The message is clear - the bottle or contents remains either hot or cold, whatever you put in, and you can rely on it. 
The second one conveys adventure, relaxed, no care in the world, free spirit. The wording conveys it’s a product you can rely on it - slightly different feel to the image but that’s not necessarily bad. It says, even though it’s cold out, your drink will stay warm. Again with the last concept, the cold works better than the hot - but this definitely is clearer for me than the last one. 'Finish the day with the temperature you started' sounds incomplete from a grammatical point of view. Should it be 'Finish the day with the temperature you started with'? Again with the previous concept, with the warm beverage, I feel like it needs a byline - like Finish the day with the temp you started with - hydroflash keeping you warm while the day is cold. Obviously not exactly that! Again, would need a copywriter to come up with it. I can't put my finger on why it jars for the warm and not the, presumably, cold water drink. Maybe because seeing snow makes me automatically think of cold weather and I am relating the temperature to the image instead of the bottle. Whereas with the cold bottle on the left, the image is more background and the bottle stands out as the hero and it's obvious the slogan is about the bottle and contents of the bottle. I covered this in the previous question. I like the ring to the first one - stays/go. The second one doesn't work for me - I'm not associating it with the beverage. And it doesn't flow as well as the first one. Also, I feel like the first one is more natural - you would pose like that in real life. The second one, if you're being a bit daring hanging out the window I don't think you'd think to take your bottle with you. Understand it's not meant to be literal. ""Finish the day with the temperature you started with"" works better for me in terms of flow. But a complete change to 'Keep warm with Hydro Flask' might also work. It's clear and simple, literal. Pure refreshment sounds inviting - refreshing. I like the colour of the flask - also appealing. The main idea is about having a reliable beverage all day - no need to buy or find another drink. The warm one works well for me - she looks like she needs a coffee - sitting down and really relishing it. The first one says 'all day long' but the imagery is quite static so could be altered to show someone on the go a bit more, perhaps. On the go with a lot on, not someone who is just having a jog at the beach. Maybe someone busy going between job and shops with phone on the ear type thing - rather than a sporty person. Not sure if that is your target market, though. Overall the concepts are perhaps clearer than the previous two but less exciting - the others inspired me to get out in nature and be more active. Is the first one with the girl drinking water too 'sexy' with the closed eyes and lips, etc? Is that distracting? I like the coffee one. It appeals to me as a coffee drinker. And she looks rugged up in a coat so needs the warm drink. This is consistent with my issue with the previous two - they were trying to sell warm drinks but in a setting where I'd personally be having a water still (not necessarily cold as it was clearly in cold weather but room temp water as I'd prefer that when doing active stuff, even if it is cold outside). Left one, cold beverage - consider an image that is more active, representing you're on the go all day long, rather than just having a jog, which could be a short activity. It's difficult to show that without showing more of what's going on in the background, which then doesn't balance with the coffee one - which I think works well as a close up.  Sorry, I don't know the solution! This is hard because I like the cold beverage in Concept A (it's fun and has more personality) and the hot in Concept R (because we love coffee in Melbourne!).  Concept A cold is more appealing to general public because the model looks like it could be anyone of us, whereas Concept R model looks hardcore into her outdoor wear and I don't feel a connection with her. If I had to choose, I'd go A because I think you'll get more sales out of the cold bottle than the warm. Smaller Keep Cups are really popular here but a bigger flask for a warm beverage, not so much.",Splash,
296557,Lucja,Leonard,runningdutchie@hotmail.com,"Concept A
Initial reaction is that it’s a bit blue peter, looks like just a bulk standard selfie, not great photography and doesn’t inspire me.
I like the words, they describe what the product will do in a fun way.
I’d like to know how it keeps the temperature and how long for.
Concept R
Initial reaction is no buy in from me, there’s nothing to grab my imagination or suggest a situation that I would use the product.
I don’t like the words, they are boring and don’t. Really explain what the product is or how it can help me. 
I wouldn’t want to know anymore as I’d be turned off immediately,
Concept S
Initial reaction is that the images are striking, dramatic and inspiring. I want to be the girl in the photo. 
I like the wording from concept A better but this does kind of peak my interest as I know want to know how’s do you mean sustainable as in environmental or purely temperature wise. I’d be assuming both.  This concept inspires me, it makes me think I’m going to be on a big exciting adventure,and that I’ll also be Uber cool doing it too because if the product.
It implies that with this flask in my hand the world and adventure is my oyster.
I believe the main concept is aspirational, get this flask and before you know it you’ll be here like this!
I don’t think the wording conveys the main idea, but it does kind of add Tom it to say not only will you be Uber cool and adventurous but you’ll be helping save the planet as the product is sustainable,so Uber cool again, win/win.
I think the imagery conveys the message quite well. I think to improve is to use the location but use the subject to be using the product fitting with the conditions, without detracting from the wow of the scenery. Product is not in the imagery, or very hard to see.
It raises questions about sustainability, what exactly is sustainable about it or is it just a strapline that means nothing.
I don’t see anything I disagree with.
The wording sounds good to me,
I think the imagery could still be hotter and colder and show the product on use with the subjects drinking from them. You could even have a group of people all having a drink, so not only are you adventuring but you’re havign a great time with friends too. This could be the in,h negative connotation is that it’s for loners. For the cold conditions, I would show either an individual or a few fiends (including both sexes) in more extreme cold, so either lashing rain and they are wrapped up in waterproofs and huddled in some shelter sipping from their flasks with steam coming off the flask spout to indicate hi hot the fluid is inside. Or use snowy conditions, group on their snowboards like they’ve just stopped on a crest of a snowy mountain enjoying a drink of hot drink, again showing the steam.
For the hot photo, I like the type of imagery but needs to look warmer, like a really warm day, if it were a group you could show the, all sweating and smiling and putting their flasks up to cheers but indicating that it’s going to be a dvreshing drink as they all look parched.
I don’t think the wording needs to change. This is a fun,affordable product for the younger generation.
It implies that you are going to be young, carefree and cool if you care this flask.
I think the main idea is that this flask is for anyone, you don’t need to be an adventurer to use it.
Not sure the wording is alongned with the image or the imagery, I think k it’s just trying to portray the image of carefree fun but the wording is trying to convey that this flask can go to all temperatures and stay as it should be, either hot or cold.
I’d like to see the photos amplified to match the wording in better sync. It looks too blue peter, too much like I’ve just taken a selfie and you’ve I seduce it for your advertising. And not really a great selfie either.
It raises questions of who’s the product for? Just young kids out and about on a jolly, or could you seriously use the product to keep your drink hot and cold as required.
I disagree with the imagery, it just doesn’t fit right.
Imagery could be negative as in it’s  just for really young people, not for any mature adults.and the imagery is boring and uninspiring. I think if you wanted to stick with this style of imagery the backdrops need to be more obviously hotter or colder and more visually striking. Especially for the temperature stays no matter where you go...where’s she gone, just her backyard? It’s jot like she’s actually gone anywhere exciting. and for finish the day I’d use more of a wintry sunset idea so you get the idea that it’s been a bone cold day but luckily you’ve got this amazing flask that has kept your hot drink exactly that but we need to see it’s hot, so steam..... Both images look like it’s cold weather and the wording doesn’t really alter that image for me.it implies that my hot drink will stay hot all day regardless of where I am or where I go, whatever the conditions.
The main idea for the concept is it’s a thermos that will keep my drink hot.
I think the wording for the coffee articulates ok but for the pure refreshment wording if that were aligned with a warmer conditions picture that would Meade more sense. 
I don’t think the imagery really conveys the message as you are not getting an accurate idea of the weather/temperature conditions, so it’s just a girl having a drink in a mediocre setting in mediocre temperatures, no wow to really emphasise how well this would work.
I would replace image one with a photo of someone who’s worked up a sweat, it’s hot, sunny and they’re clukd be climbing/hiking a mountain and then take a refreshing drink, alternatively for the hot drink, get the conditions colder, let’s see some snow or ice, or rain lashing it down and sowmknw is huddled up Tom keep warm and having their warm drink, even get the visualisation of steam com The imagery doesn’t work so well as I’m not really feeling the temperature she is in, looks very middle of the road.
Questions or raises would be is it just for coffee or any hot drinks, that is it is a specific coffee filter pot or a thermos fit for multi purpose.
I disagree with the imagery not portraying the temperature the girl is in.
The only thing with the wording is the coffee connotation, assuming it’s use is for all hot drinks but this could isolate.
Imagery definitely needs works, it’s not eye catching or inspirational. I don’t see any negative connotations but just not very creative, As previously mentioned I would scrap the photos and for the cold drink I’d like to see an image of someone who is clearly hot and in need of a cool drink. And for the hot drink the coffee sitcoms need to reflect this, I want to see cold weather and the subject feeling this cold weather as we all do when we are out in it.
Worked g is fine for cold drink for the hot drink I’d look to I’ve away from coffee and incorporate wording to include all hot drinks, Concept S as it’s more inspiring, dramatically and visually pleasing. I think it embraces the adventurous nature that everyone seems to be vying for these days and makes you picture yourself in that spot with that flask. Sustainable is certainly a buzz word that’s not going away so that is also key.",Splash,
285742,jana,studzinska,jana.gibalova@gmail.com,"Really like the visuals. Female, explorer, positive and outdoors!
The second concept is the best as you can actually it is the same woman but in two different situations.
The only thing im confused about and want to know more: is it different flask for hot vs warm, correct? Concept A: Teplota zostáva bez ohľadu na to, kam vy idete. Skončite deň s teplotou, s ktorou ste začali.
Concept R: čisté osvieženie po celý deň. káva ostatne taká, akú ste ju naliali
Concept S: dokonalá teplota je teraz udržateľná. občerstvenie je udržateľné 1) Outdoors, exploring, traveling, healthy lifestyle, one with nature
2) The images speak for itself, they are warm colours, pleasant to look at. more nature than showing who is on the picture. The put the nature and environment on first plan.
3) Be eco friendly on the go.
4) Perfectly. 
5) Same as above. Good fit for purpose!
6) I think it is spot on. You don't need half naked model or pretty face to show a product. Well done! 1) Maybe make it more personal? Your refreshment is sustainable? to make it stand out you made the right choice
2) I'm still curious if it is the same bottle or not :)
3) the word ""now"" - there are some flasks on market already. Now makes it as if it is the first time ever.
4) as above.
5) Winter trails keeping hot drink and summery views for cold drinks. Perfect for me! Now to be replaced or just simply left out? As a pure statement: Perfect temperature is sustainable. Also noticed just now that it says ""temp"" - would use the full word tbh
For te second one: word ""your"" can be added before refreshment. but that's just only if i should be picky
I do like the pics as mentioned previously so nothing on that front 1) Created for people on the move. 
2) Flask will stay with you all day long no matter where you go
3) Always with you no matter where.
4) Fits well.
5) As above.
6) Not sure about the selfie, maybe first pic could be on move as well? Human powered or on bike I don't like the selfie mode with cut off arm. Also the car is not 100% great idea as a) what on earth is she doing ? btw eco sustainable vs cars.. tricky 
What is the girl doing with flask in her hand trying to jump out of the window..?
As above.
Wording sounds good to me.
Again lovely colours, pleasant, but yeah.. that car image is just wrong Wording is good but pics are not. Previous concept was much better. those above look like some of those fake instagrammers, doing everything for nice shot but not really even knowing why. It looks really posed and just simply unnatural. it is not like the car is parked as it is obvious it is in the middle of the road.. I'm not really sure to be honest. 
Same as above.
Enjoy your drinks all day long?
I dont like this concept that much. It says all day long and then there is cofee the way you take it. Just somehow can't figure out how those are related?
I'm not really sure what the main idea is in here im afraid. I get the general concept but cant see the one thing that connects them. 1) I dont get the main concept, that one idea that should connect these pictures. Other than the fact the model has closed eyes on both pics.
2) not sure.
3) closing your eyes when you drink. Also all day long - how big is the bottle?
4) the above mentioned all day long. Also the coffee - you take it from where? Home? Coffee shop?
5) not many people drink with closed eyes. Also the patagonia logo is bit confusing as it is more visible as the logo of the flask. on the second pic you cant see the bottle logo either. Wording: for the first pic - pure refreshment whenever you need it? For second as mentioned where you take the coffee from? Maybe the way you make it? also what if the targeted client doesnt drink coffee? It can be tea..
Imaginery: closed eyes on BOTH pictures and Patagonia logo Concept S! Best pictures, simple, natural, not too posed. Focused on nature not models. Realistic images. Focused on outdoors enthusiasts who like nature and movement and hydrate on the go.",Splash,
301038,Haeun ,Kwak,23cornmay@gmail.com,"I like R the best. The photo is catchy, easy to be understood (because both women are holding the bottle and drinking something inside the bottle obviously), and the message written described most of the expectation of the people to their bottle very clearly. What I like the most about is that, when I saw the Cold concept from R I felt fresh and clean after looking at the photo, while I felt cozy and warm when I saw the photo of the Hot one. 

The picture which got my very first attention was Concepts A-Hot one; however, it took quite a moment for me to digest what this ad was about. The woman in the picture definitely looks free in the open space, but it might take a moment for a viewer to capture the bottle she is holding. The freedom and excitement she feels doesn't seem to come out from the bottle she is holding or the quality of the drink she had from using the bottle. 

For Concepts S, I felt risky and insecure, worried, and a certain tension. Korean.
Concepts A 
Cold :   ""어딜 가든, 그 온도 그대로."" 
Instead of writing a perfect sentence (that includes a subject and a perfect verb), I didn't end with the verb form (in Korean, the sentence ends with a verb). 
Hot :   ""하루의 끝을 하루를 시작한 온도 그대로.""
I was confused what ""the temperature you started"" might have meant. So, I tentatively added ""the temperature of the day"" to explain what temperature referred to, because in the original English catchphrase it says ""finish the day"" --- to match the pair of words ""finish"" and ""start"".

Concepts R 
Cold :   ""하루 어느 때나 상쾌하게""
Translated directly and word by word, ""pure refreshment"" sounds really awkward in Korea. Instead, I phrased it more like ""(staying) refreshingly"". 
Hot :  ""커피를 처음 담았을 때, 그대로 따뜻하게.""
I add the word ""따뜻하게 (warmly)"" to clarify the element of which exactly is ""stay[ing] the way you take"". 

Concepts S
Cold :  ""완벽한 온도가 이제는 계속 유지됩니다.""
Hot :   ""개운한 느낌이 그대로 유지됩니다."" What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
L: I tried to generate anything in my head, looking at this ad, but got nothing. 
R: Calm, relaxing, nice time for being alone, taking rest.
What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
L: Just like you sustain your strength wherever you go, out bottle can sustains the initial temperature.
R: You can refresh yourself whenever you want with our special bottle. 
How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
L: I still clearly have no idea how that wording can be related to a person whose face I barely can see thus not allowing me to see what she is thinking or whether she is fine surrounded by a tall tree and huge rocks.
R: I think the wording is very clear about the main idea. 
How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
R: The woman is sitting almost at the edge of the cliff, and it's a high angle shot, all of which elements make me feel nervous and risky. I don't think I can take refreshment from that photo.
Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
R & L : Change the photo. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
The wording is giving a very clear message, but the sentences do not match with the photo. Also, the photos do not attract the attention. 

What questions does it raise?
L: Where's that place? That place looks cool and awesome. But what does it have to do with this bottle image on the left and that wording? Why does the wording say ""now""? Why the word ""now"" is relevant in that context?
R: Is she or he okay? Where is that place? That person looks cold and lonely.

What things do you disagree with? 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
L: I was wondering, why ""now""? The person in the photo is situated in quite cold climate, so, I guess, the temperature she needs is the warm one. But the bottle looks too cool to fit that situation and the wording does not really clarify to garauntee that temperature the person needs. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
R: This photo gives equivocal feelings. The person looks settled and relaxed, but at the same time so lonely and detached. And, the bottle in the backpack looks so irrelevant to the person's situation. L: The wording should be changed into more suitable one to the situation described in the imagery.


R: Probably, the image of this person drinking liquid inside the bottle and showing us the satisfied look would make it clear that she is getting refreshment she wants at the top of the hill. What are all the thoughts and associations?
L: She looks happy and very excited. She is maybe taking a selfie to show off her newly bought bottle, which makes me wonder the value of the bottle to her. 
R: The person looks free in the open space. The environment suggests she is in cold climate, but she doesn't seem to care about it. And, maybe that has to do with the thing she is holding in her left hand? 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
L: Use our bottle and it will make you look cool and happy, an outgoing person.
R: With our bottle, your free spirit will no longer have to worry about the cold temperature. 

Concept's intention in a single sentence. 
L: Our bottle keeps the fresh temperature wherever you go.
R: No matter how long your journey went, our bottle will keep the temperature of the liquid you poured in our bottle. 

The wording?
Both of them explicitly explains the main idea. Very clearly.

The imagery?
L: The person is definitely on the trip and looks satisfied with the bottle she is holding. 
R: The person is on the trip and also holding a bottle as if it's an important element in her trip, which makes sense with the wording somehow. 

Any need to enhance?
R: Still, what the bottle can do or what the bottle can give to the person is not clearly shown. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
I'm still figuring out how much the word ""temperature"" in both wordings resonate with the photos. 

What questions does it raise?
L: Why does she look so happy? Why does she look as if she is showing off her bottle? What is so special about that bottle?
R: Where's she going? Where's this awesome looking place? Wait, I've just realized she was actually sitting on the front seat of the car. (And the handle is on the right because this is company in UK...?) Does she really have to hold her bottle with her hand and show it to us? Why?

What things do you disagree with? 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
The wordings are fine. 
L: But, I wonder what the temperature that ""you started"" (whether it is cold or warm) was. I can't somehow find the clear answer from both the photo and the wording.

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Both of them make me want to get out of here and go on a trip. R: If they were intended to say that your warm drink would stay with you no matter when you started off from your home to go on a trip, I think it might have worked better to add some warm vibe in the photo. For example, a group of people sitting and taking a rest on the snowy mountain and the steam is coming out from the bottle, making everyone so cozy and happy. 

Also, I have a question to all of these concept images: Why are they all alone and all women? Why can't they be a woman with a short hair and exercising so hard? Or, a man who does a cleaning work in a hotel or in a restaurant? Or, a group of people with friends or family? Or a woman on an expedition? What are all the thoughts and associations?
L: Thirsty, so drinking a fresh drink. Hope that drink in fresh and cool. Windy.
R: Warm. Sunny. Cozy. Relaxing. Woods. In the afternoon. 

Inexplicit implication?
We are having fresh drink that are in a perfect condition we wanted from our water!

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be?
L: No matter how sweaty or thirsty you get, and no matter where you feel that way, our bottle is right next to you to offer you a fresh drink.
R: Stay warm and cozy with our bottle where the warmth of your drink lasts long enough.

The wording?
I like both of the wordings. Both are short and simple, but deliver very clear message. 
L: Words like ""pure"" and ""refreshment"" generates cool, breezy, satisfying refreshment I can get.
R: The wording is easily relatable to anyone who drinks and wants to drink hot coffee regularly. 

The imagery?
L: Works pretty well. 
R: Works really well, although it is such a simple image. She is wearing a light jumper and in the middle of doing something. As she drinks, the warm ray of sunlight rushes in, which somehow implies that the drink is making her cozy.

Any need for enhancement?
L: Maybe that the person was working out should be more suggestive. Because, right now, she looks cold and the color of the bottle looks cold. What she needs might be ""warmth"" not ""pure refreshment"". What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
L: Just a minor detail in the image. 

What questions does it raise?
L: So the person has been working out, but where are sweaty clothes, hair, or face? 

What things do you disagree with? 
The color of the bottle. L: I would change the color of the bottle. It could be warm red or light brown colour. And, add more artificial sweats or watery effects on her face and clothes so that we can clearly see that she definitely need something clean and pure refreshment. So, when she puts her mouth to the bottle to drink, she would probably make the most relaxing face. Concept R. 
It has clear articulation of the main idea both through wording and images. Also, the place and the outfits are easily relatable and more familiar to our culture.",Splash,
296559,Guilhem,Menard,guilhem.menard@gmail.com,"1. I understand the use of the flask looking at the commercials. 
2. I don't get why there are two shapes of bottle : one keeps the cold and one that keeps the warmth? inverted in the last commercial?
3. The commercial is for young girls, so I don't feel like this commercial is for me, but I could buy the flask for a friend or girlfriend.
4. Visually speaking:
i/ Blue is a cold color, I feel it is totally counter-intuitive to link it to warmth. So the 'hot' world is not sufficient enough to suggest warmth for me. 
ii/ Blue on blue ? flask over a blue background doesn't make it eye-catchy at all.
5. Are the words ""cold"" and ""hot"" part of the posters? For me they shouldn't be necessary
6. I like the design of the bottle. I like the fact that it is in stainless steel and it is good to see the small shinny silver stripe under the top of the bottle.


Concepts A : Too outdoor, too fake, left is not warm enough to make me thirsty of coldness, and the right picture seems totally fake.

Concepts R : + hipster girl and urban situations so I like it more! Feel more connected to the girl, and less fake. Like the fact that she is afro.

Concepts S: Lazy ad: The sentence is nearly: buy this bottle, it is sustainable :-/. - too outdoors pictures not focused on pleasure of drinking (better in the concepts R) Concepts A:

Left ""La température reste là même où que vous alliez"":  nearly the same sentence.
Right "" Finissez la journée avec la temperature avec laquelle vous l'avez commencé"" This sentence seemed already weird to me in English, it is the even weirder in French to me. (seems like we are talking about body temperature)

Concepts R: 
Left ""De la fraicheur toute la journée"" Saying ""pure refreshment"" in French would feel really fake to me. 
Right ""Du café reste à votre température idéale"" Sentence is a bit changed but we keep the personalized: ""the way you"" by adding the ""votre"" in French

Concepts S
Left ""Maintenant la temperature idéale est durable"" We keep the pun, but it doesn't make it a good punchline ;-)
""La fraicheur est durable"" Same with the pun, but still doesn't make it great to me. 1&2 For me it is really the concept of protecting the nature, going outdoor, living a life of adventure. It is for women, who practice sport and use technical outfits sometimes. They are also alone, so independent, and free with their flask in hand.
3. I would say that it is : buy our flask to be a free and independent women who can go anywhere she wants, and protect the nature at the same time.
4. I quite like the puns, and sustainability is a very, very strong argument for me, but it feels like the commercial is quite lazy. The sentence is nearly: buy this bottle, be free and independent, it is sustainable :-/.  The pictures are too focused on the outdoors and not on pleasure of drinking (concepts R).
The pictures are quite plain, we are so used to beautiful pictures right now, so I'd use a lot more creativity for the slogan and pictures to make me want to buy it.
5. The imagery does the job, but is not really special. looks like a bunch of other unsplash.com pics.
I realize just now, after spending 10 min on these pictures, that it is the bottom a a cap that and not bond hair on the right picture, so is a man on the picture!! I thought it was a woman.
6. More radical slogans, colors and pictures. Change perspectives. ex: Patagonia commercial don't buy this jacket. & Again the blue for warmth doesn't work. 1. It is too focused on sustainability and not the use of the product. I see humans alone in front of the great nature, and a flask in their pocket, and I don't feel touched or affected by these pictures. I even feel that it can be real bullshit, because I don't know your company, and the pictures seem really like stock pictures, a bit fake. 
2. Why are there two flasks? How is it sustainable to buy two flasks ^^?
How is it sustainable generally? What is your company? How the product is made? What will be the packaging? (if it comes with a lot of packaging and waste, then you are bullshitting me about sustainability.)
3. The concept of sustainability and this assertion: buying your product is sustainable. I feel like your main goal is not to create a sustainable product, so I could feel betrayed by this commercial.
4. Yes, as said before, I like the pun but don't believe in the world sustainability, it is linked to greenwashing if I don't know the mission of the brand. And ""let's go"" as a slogan doesn't rely to the sustainability announced in the commercial. 
5. Already answered in the last set of questions. 1. Taking a step back, I'd recommend:

Option A: Be really serious about sustainability. The whole brand has to have a mission about changing the world and getting the planet cleaner, mixed with an image linked to outdoor activity and the pleasures of nature. This story should be the DNA of the brand, the WHY of the brand. If it is not the center of the project, then don't push commercials that fake that it is the core of the projects because people won't buy it. Or at least I won't. I think about brands like TOMS shoes, Gobilab (Flasks!) Patagonia, VEJA in France, Hopaal, Biocoop, Malongo they always speak about their mission, and people believe in them, and then they speak about their cool products.

Option B: Be less serious about sustainability. A good way to not feel bullshitted, is to use more humour, fun, creativity, and human feelings, and set sustainability in the background, not in the foreground, to fight with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance.
Ex: innocent smoothies. The name of the brand and the logo is funny, the packaging  and commercials are Really funny, and I sometimes buy their juice because I feel it's fun and more sustainable than the other products.

2. a / b So yes, change the words and imagery, according to question 1. Either you go sustainable all in, or you really change the slogan and picture to bring some humour and truth in the pictures. 1. Concept is about fun and adventure, and outdoor activity and holidays. It is for young girls who want to have fun and enjoy the adventure of life.
2/3 Buy Hydroflask, you'll be an adventurous vivid and happy young lady.
4. It might be because I am not a native English speaker, because the sentences seem a bit complicated to me to express a simple idea. Ok I think I just got a pun right now: it is a bit like a commercial for a deodorant but the joke is that you are selling a flask. Hum I had troubles to understand it, I have to admit :-). But now, I feel it is a funny idea, that I would stress a lot more. Even if maybe it is not intended at all, I am a bit confused here.
5. It works reasonably now that I get the pun, but I would emphasize more to make the joke more easy to get :-). Works well on the left : sentence + picture. But on the right, I'd use the sentence in a urban situation, because the sentence refers to a normal day I think, and a normal day is not usually riding a van on top of a mountain holding a flask.
6. use more radical pictures: to me, the girl should be in a really sunny and shiny environment and seem ""fresh""
And on the other side, I'd use a background that is really less cliché. 1. The joke, because I didn't get it? Even now I am not 100% sure there is one.

2. Why two flasks? The left and right one cannot contain warm and cold ?
What are they drinking?
Who drives the van on the right image?

3. I think I already answered questions to this question before.

4. As said before, this wording seems really heavy for me, and the sentence is not catchy to me.

5. Left image: I wouldn't like to drink something fresh in this shade that seems quite cold (mountains on background?) I am not found of the fake happiness of the girl and the selfie style, she seems to be a bit shallow. For instance, I feel more connected to this type of people in this commercial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP03oEjjLkY (+ hipster, normecore style)

I feel it is cold as well (color blue). I find the picture totally fake: who is in a yellow van holding a bottle and looking at the road? It doesn't seem to me that the day is finishing but starting according to the light. 1 & 2. 

i. Change the blue background to create contrast with the bottle.
ii. Left image Do not photoshop as much the teeth of the girl on the left. I like the background though, because it doesn't seem too fake.
iii. Font: I like the font used by the way: modern and readable.
iv. Right image: I'd change the whole picture on the right, that seems really fake to me (why is there no wind in her hair :-0?)
v. Left flask image: I don't get that the drink will be fresh. maybe you could add some drops on the bottle or some icy photoshop layer to suggest freshness? 
vi. Right flask image: I don't get that the drink will be Warm. Change the blue color to a reddish and yellowish one and bring some heat on the picture. 1. This bottle makes the drinks inside incredibly delicious. You'll be a hipster, fresh, sexy and trendy young woman if you use our Hydro Flask. This girl is athletic, urban, but she likes outdoor as well. Pictures are associated to pleasure.
2. This flask will make you want to hydrate a lot and will give you a lot of pleasure, and also it will make you athletic.
3. Buy Hydro Flask, and you'll be a trendy young woman and have a lot of pleasure when you drink it.
4. I really like more this concept. First sentence is associated to pleasure, and second one makes you think the flask is personalized for you.
5. The close up images + closed eyes + obvious delight associated to the gesture of drinking convey really well the idea.
6. The usual feedback: change the blue background color + maybe sentences more modern and personalized. 1. As always, I think we don't get why there are two bottles, one for the cold beverages, and one for the warm ones.
2. What's inside the bottle on the left that makes it so delicious? There seem to be a bottleneck that we can't see on the flaks picture on the left. How is it?
How much liquid you can put in the bottle ? On the right, is it simple to drink coffee in this flask? How much is it?
3. I don't disagree with a lot of things.
4. I don't feel comfortable with the first sentence, the ""marketing bullshit"" alarm rang in my head: ""pure refreshments"" is a sentence that for me nobody uses except marketers and advertising business people. The second one i way more simple and clear, and personalized, so I like it more. It could be a guy talking to another introducing the flask saying : ""coffee stays the way you like it"" Simple and clear.
5. I like it a lot. beautiful girl, and red and blue contrast, on the left image. However I don't get why she's drinking a refreshing drink with this cold weather outside, and dressed with a padded jacket, even if she seems to be in sportswear, and thirsty --> Would like more sun and shinyness. The second picture is more rational. 1 & 2
i. Again, change the background color and specify the difference between the 2 bottles.
ii. Change the wording on the left and put the most liked cold drink, as on the right (coffee) to set up an example that stays in mind. Like ""My iced tea keeps fresh all day long"" with a better English than mine ;-).
iii. Great use of colours on the left image, would keep that contrast on the right image.
iv. I would specify that the second image is in the city, to show that you have different usage of this bottle.

What I really like about this concept is that it is focused on the pleasure and advantage of drinking the flask. Sustainability is shown in the background with the Patagonia jacket, and it could even be added to this advertising in the slogan of the brand (Hydroflask : life-lasting flasks /  endlessly re-usable flasks ..., a slogan that show that the product is made to live long)
1. Pleasure 2. Sustainability + model identification = good concept. I would totally choose concepts R and add more explicit sustainability to it, with a pinch of humour. 

Why?

o. It is really clear and understandable, compared to the others.
i. It is focused on the pleasure of the buyer, and we humans are selfish and pleasure-oriented animals. 
ii. The pictures are beautiful, modern and not fake.
iii. I feel it gives a better image of the brand, more classy.",Splash,
301039,Joan,Kim,kimjoans@gmail.com,"In general, I felt the concept of cold matches with being fresh and lively, while the concept of hot with cozy and fervor. I liked the features that the images were generally matching with what we normally think with whether something is cold or hot. However, I personally think that for pictures in the hot images, I felt like the images of the bottle and the background somewhat mismatch with the first expression when we think of 'hot.' Concept A:
(Cold) 당신의 체온은 어디에 가나 당신과 함께합니다.
(Hot) 처음 시작했던 체온 그대로 하루를 마무리하세요.

Concept R: 
(Cold) 하루 종일 순수한 상쾌함을.
(Hot) 커피는 당신이 마시는 방식과 같이 갑니다.

Concept S:
(Cold) 이제 완벽한 온도가 유지가능합니다.
(Hot) 재충전은 지속 가능합니다. This concept somewhat makes me think of myself in the traveling, and the bottle becomes one of my best travel buddies.
So it seems to have a main idea of the concept is that it is the best way to have the bottle to remain lively and energetic on one's activity.
The imagery does a lot of things, like it makes people imagine themselves traveling in the middle of wild and mysterious land, and then you have a nice companion wherever you go. 
I think the extra messages for encouraging how well the bottle fits with activities such as traveling would much enhance the imagery conveyed through the pictures. Okay, now we are in the middle of traveling imagery with this concept for both sides of the pictures shown.
I thought it is questionable what will be actually sustainable: for example, with those pics, it can be translated in two ways. The first one out of two might be that the drinks inside is sustainable, and this is maybe the intended message through the advertisement. However, there is the other possible message conveyed through this: the temperature of the person who are holding the bottle is sustainable. I am not sure whether such thinkings were triggered by either message or the overall imagery with such background images, but such the subtle factors seem to make a huge change in the message conveyed. In general, I think the issues claimed in the previous session could be resolved in either way: changing the wording or imagery. I said so because I did not think it is the matter of only one factor but exclusive matter: if you change one of them then the whole factors will be put in harmony and make the advertisement much effective. This is a bit complicating... but I did not think the concept of this section and that of I thought of before were that different: you are going somewhere wild or you are in travel, and the bottle becomes your life companion during your journey.
From these above, it is followed by the main idea that I have thought on these: so if we get those bottles, then our journey becomes much enriched. I think the message itself of both pictures have the same issues that I have mentioned in the previous sessions and concepts: the temperature of what matters? Two interpretations are possible: either the temperature of your drink inside the bottle, or the temperature of yours. Of course I think the message itself is brilliant in linguistic sense, but the effect of the advertisement on the efficacy of the bottle shown in the pictures might decrease if the people simply do not follow the interpretations what we expected prior to the actual advertisements.
Imageries seemed fine, in personal thought. Since the wordings should work well with imagery, I could think of the methods for matching the wordings and imagery with much more effective or eye-catching additional phrases.
Also, I think the message conveyed would have better effect on conveying the messages if some additional catchphrases were added: for example, like ""forever good companion"" or ""on your journey."" Both pictures made me think of an idea of refulfilling energies. They provide such a message of energy as it makes the readers feel refreshed if they use such the bottle. Though not explicitly said, it seems to imply that if they do not get the bottle then there will be certainly almost no other opportunities for such an experience of refreshment.
So this bottle is for containing drinks, right? I think the main idea is that you can experience the moments of refreshment with the bottle.
Such the background images make a synergic effect on conveying the message I mentioned at the previous statements, though I thought it would have been better if the background color matches with the cover on the right side. Particularly for the left picture, I don't think the imagery matches with the actual color of the bottle: the model is wearing red, and I thought maybe the 'bluer' pictures might have worked better on such the imagery.
And hmm, what does it mean by 'pure'? I know it is deliberately conveying some messages they would like to be spread, but I first thought it was not really clear how to express such 'pure' refreshment. Words themselves seem not to be a serious problem, though I mentioned as the minor comments at the previous session; I would rather change imagery in general.
I would say it would have been much better if the colors of the modeled person's clothing. For example, you would like to emphasize the bottle for cold drinks and you want to express the imagery of refreshment: you would feel more comfortable to look at the images matching the color overall, such as the clothing also shares similar color with that of product colors. It also applies when you plan to advertise the bottles for hot or warmer drinks. I would choose Concept R for advertising in my country. For deciding the answers, I had to think which of the images above would be much more familiar to everyday people in my country.
The images were mainly focusing on the people rather than other factors, while the other concepts seemed more focused on the factors outside the people such as wild, nature, and landscapes.
Citizens in my country mostly focus on how the people around them do well and how do they spend their life with whom. I thought that probably the advertisement would go much better if the advertisement focuses on the people themselves.",Splash,
301033,Juli ,Kibe,julierkb@icloud.com,"Initial reactions:
A. the product must work really well to say that.
R. sounds and looks too familiar (cliche).
S. sounds like 2019 and I personally like pictures that don't show closeup shots of people's faces. (Are the posters misplaced? Shouldn't it be the other way round?)

What I like and don't like:
A. I like that it tells me what the product does but don't like that it doesn't do more than that, at least to me.
R. I like the midel, don't like that everything sounds and looks cliched.
S. I like that it talks about sustainability.

What I want to know more abot:
If they come in different colors and shapes as well. A Cold: どこに行っても、冷たさそのまま。backtrans: wherever you go, the cold (stays) as it is.
A Hot: 一日の始まりの温かさで、一日の終わりを。backtrans: with the warmth at the beginning of the day, (finish) the end of the day.
R Cold: すっきり爽やか、一日中。it's basically the same sentence but instead of the adjective 'pure' I used a mimetic word 'sukkiri' (meaning refreshing/clean/neat).
R Hot: 今日もコーヒーは、ずっと入れたて。backtrans: today's coffee (again) stays freshly taken.
S Cold on the left (which is actually hot, I think?): 温度を守ることは、地球を守ること。backtrans: protecting (keeping) the temperature is protecting (keeping) the earth. (the english word 'sustainable' itself used in a japanese sentence cannot be associated with the concept of keeping the temperature as it is, and the japanese version of the word 'sustainable' sounds too literal and technical, hence the commonly used japanese phrase 'protecting the earth')
S Hot on the right (which I assume is actually cold?): 地球も私もずっと元気に。Making the earth and me stay refreshed (fine/healthy). 1. Hot: encouraging healthy and sustainable lifestyle and appreciating nature. Cold: encouraging being sporty and travelling around the world.
2. Hot: if one cares about their physical health they probably also care about the environment. Cold: no need to worry about the beverage and wasting plastics.
3. Hot: being good for the body and the environment. Cold: enabling worry-free journey.
4. Hot: 'perfect temp' and 'sustainable' associated with being conscious about health and environment. Cold: feels straightforward.
5. Hot: well. however it also looks a bit too cold to the extent that it makes me question if the product can really keep the 'perfect' temperature. Cold: it does, but at the same time it doesn't really evoke refreshing image.
6. Add more warmth to the picture for the Hot, and add more brightness or movements in the picture for the Cold. 1. Hot: I live in a city and only drink warm beverages indoor, so being conscious about environment to me doesn't necessarily mean you enjoy going out into the woods or mountains. Cold: again, I would love to have a sustainable bottle but I live in a city and do not have that many opportunities to do outdoor activities.
2. Hot: is it really sustainable? Cold: how sustainable is it?
3. I don't disagree - it just feels unrelatable.
4. no.
5. Hot: no negative connotations but it simply looks too cold. Cold: it could be more sunny, bright and energetic. 1. Hot: I would take into account that nature could exist in the city life as well, and probably would have a picture that emphasizes the warmth that the product brings to you rather than the cold. Cold: I would try to identify what could represent refreshment in a more vibrant and positive way and think about daily situations where refreshment would be needed, such as working out.
2. a: the current wording is fine. b. both of them look a bit too dark and unrelatable to people in the city. 1. Cold: people who love sports and travelling. Hot: people who live far from their workplace/school.
2. Cold: encouraging people to go on adventures. Hot: take the bottle with you the whole day.
3. Cold: the bottle as your new travel buddy. Hot: the bottle as your new daily must have.
4. Cold: pretty straightforward. Hot: straightforward.
5. Cold: straightforward. Hot: it does to some extent.
6. Cold: I'd love to see it emphasize 'you can take this wherever you go' aspect more because it sounds exciting. Hot: I like the wording but the picture feels a bit off so a picture that matches well with the phrase would be great. 1. Cold: the picture feels too staged for a selfie. Hot: can't relate to the picture.
2. does the temperature really stay as it is throughout the day?
3. nothing.
4. no.
5. Cold: if it has to be a selfie than I would prefer it to be more natural. Hot: I just don't see why this had to be taken in this pose. 1. Cold: change the picture to a more natural looking selfie, and maybe change the location and the styling too.. Hot: probably change the situation of the picture and set it in the evening to show that the warmth stays throughout the day.
2. a. current wording sounds fine.
b. as mentioned above. 1. Cold: sporty and healthy lifestyle. Hot: for coffee (or tea) drinkers.
2. Cold: constant hydration is important? Hot: now coffee drinkers can drink coffee anytime.
3. Cold: the bottle will help you keep hydrated. Hot: no more tasteless tepid coffee.
4. Cold: to some extent. Hot: very well.
5. Cold: not really. it feels off. Hot: to some extent.
6. Cold: either more emphasis on refreshment in the picture or emphasis on hydration in wording. Hot: more emphasis on the warmth would be good as it does not look like she's drinking hot coffee. 1. Cold: personally I'd prefer the picture to look more summerly and refreshing as I cannot relate myself drinking something cold in that weather and that clothes. Hot: just the picture. It feels a bit off.
2. What's so special about this product? (The wording for Cold and picture for Hot seem a bit cliched and they're not really recognizable).
3. nothing.
4. Cold: 'pure' refreshment sounds cliched and vague. Hot: I like the wording, yet I feel like it would appeal more to the consumers in Japan if it were tea or just didn't specify the drink.
5. Cold: as stated in the first question. Hot: it doesn't have any negative connotations but it could be better. 1. Cold: I'd look for alternative words to describe refreshment and make the picture look more summerly. Hot: I'd make the picture look more natural, down to earth and real, such as drinking coffee while running late to the office/school or while working/studying.
2. a. Cold: as stated above. Hot: it could be tea.
b. as stated above. nothing else. While the concept of sustainability is still not huge in Japan, it also means that there's a space for such products in the market, so I would choose S. It seems to me that A would not be relatable enough for the targeted demographics in Japan, and similar concepts like R can already be seen everywhere in the Japanese market. If the ad succeeds at introducing the idea of sustainability to the consumers, it could bring something new and exciting to the market.",Splash,
295466,Ioana,Lupascu,ioana.slupascu@gmail.com,"My first thought is that the brand seems focus on nature lovers and people on the move. There seems to be a focus on activity, motion where the flask is more of companion along the way. 

I like the mood of the photos, the whole adventure setting. The thing that makes me question the intent of the brand is the way it uses sustainability as a marketing strategy. People that regularly go out in the wild have been using reusable product for a long time, it's all part of the leave no trace philosophy. What would make me be more interested in one brand over another is its technical abilities and whether the products are ethically produced and the company invests in the local economy. 

I'd definitely like to know more about the production and how sustainable that part of the process is, more about the company and the people that works there. What is the philosophy of the company. I no longer buy just the product, I want to invest and help brands that are focused on sustainability on a core level, not just on a marketing one. Do part of the profits get reinvested in social schemes? What is the whole story? 1. A. Temperatura rămâne indiferent unde mergi. 
1. B. Termină ziua cu aceiași temperatură cu care ai început. 

2.A. Răcoritor pentru o zi întreagă. - It doesn't really work in the same way in Romanian, refreshment is refreshing drinks in the translation 
2.B. Cafeaua rămâne așa cum ți-o dorești. Take becomes want in the translation to make the sentence flow. 

3.A Temperature ideală e acum sustenabilă.
3.B Răcoritor e sustenabil. Same as before, the word refreshments becomes two words in translation, refreshing drinks. First though, how you can cruz along your trip with a reusable flask instead of a single use product. In some way, it feels like an encouragement to leave no trace when exploring the wild. The second imagine has a reflective feel to it, appreciating nature and contributing to keeping it clean.

It implies a leave no trace philosophy. 

Clearly this particular ad focuses on the reuse aspect of the flask. One sentence. Leave no trace. 

It make more sense in with the cold drinks, the wording for the first ad doesn't flow as well for me. 

I fell like having a hot drink in more of static action. You would generally stop, rest and have a drink to warm up. It's almost like the actions should be the other way around. 

Having a drink at the desirable temperature is almost like a reward after an intense activity, I'd like to see the imagery convey something closer to a feeling of the end of an action, the moment just before you would have a sip from the flask. I associate the idea of a sustainable hot drink more to an urban environment. You don't get that many chances for a single use holder for a hot drink in nature, it's generally packed from home in something that can hold it for a while. It makes more sense to have perfect temperature on the go rather than sustainable. Also, the use of now is a bit strange, as having flasks that can hold warm drinks has been available for a while. For me, it fits better with an image of a person that has stopped rather that on the move. Could have more that one person in it. 

The wondering static position on the model doesn't work so well, although it is visually a strong image, it's too static, the breeze you get from the water is the first refreshing thing that pops in my mind. I often hold a flask in my hand when I'm trekking, and constantly hydrate. I like short statement. 

Sustainability refers to more that just having a refillable flask, which falls into the consumers choice, I would personally like to know more about what makes the brand sustainable. I would add some information about how the brand on its side is being sustainable. It's about both parts making an effort, so in a way I wanna know why I should make the choice and support this brand. 

I'd swap the actions on the images, make the winter one static (when there is snow and potential to slip I would not have unnecessary objects in my hands) and the hot summer one more active. The colour schemes work nicely, the blue of the bottle pops in the photos, which makes me wonder if it the background it the bottle itself needs more that just a plain blue. 

Potentially swap the position of sustainable, 'Sustainable is refreshing.' feels more inclusive. Makes me think of being active, on the go, exploration. I also noticed the logo of the brand a lot more. It pops in this setting. There is a feeling of excitement and positivity that comes across. 

I would think that the flask is really light by the way its held.

It makes me think it's technical abilities are reliable. Although everything else is in a state of change, the characteristics of the liquid inside the flask sty the same. Reliable in motion. 

The wording works nicely for the first concept, but feels a bit odd for the second one. 

The imagery definitely supports the the obvious message that need to come across for the cold flask, on the second one I don't really understand why the character is looking back at the road. 

I'd like the image with the car to be set closer to sunset or twilight, to amplify the idea of end of day, thus supporting the word 'finish'. It seems like it's a selfie on a trekking experience, I'd like to see some more objects on the model, like a light backpack, to emphasise this idea of on the go. I like how it showcase how easy it is to carry the bottle. 

The photo seems to be taken at a random moment of the day, if the setting was closer to the end of the day, it would support the idea that the contents stay warm as long as you are exploring. I do find it a bit odd to go out a window of a moving car with a potentially heavy object that can create a dangerous outcome. For the first image I would add a light backpack or some sort of light carrying equipment to strengthen the idea of a whole day experience. This way it the wording would make more sense, you are out for a long time exploring but the content is still super fresh. A slight change to the imagery would make the concept a lot better. 

As for the second concept, I would potentially take the shot with the front of the car, maybe at a stop, with the sunset in the background. Both the driver and the character which is out the window can be in the photo. A change in the imagery would help the concept. I enjoy how easy it seems to be to drink from the flask. 

What seems implicit is how easy it is to hold the bottle and the fact the outer temperature of the flask is pleasant no matter whether the contents are hot or cold. 

The contents of the flask are going to be as expected. Just the way you like it. 

Both wording and imagery seem to be doing a good job. 

I'd like to see more of the back setting of the images. I'd like to see more of the background and get a better idea of where it's set. Are there any connection with Patagonia? I'd like to see the image a bit more zoomed out. I'm not sure why the model has its eyes closed. 

It would be nice for the bottle not to be cut by the image. 

Same as before, the lack of a more defined background makes the image too generic. Where is it placed, urban, nature, park?  Not sure 'take it' is the best choice of words in this case. 

I like the zoomed in image and the feeling it conveys. I would choose a more defined background, since the shot is taken from an up point, maybe choose a darker drop back setting - trees, hills, mountains with a blur filter. Also, zoom out so the models flask and hair isn't cropped. I thin placing the subject in a better defined environment would strengthen the concept. Rather that pure, which in my mind often makes reference to the quality of the content, I would use ideal.

Same as before, make the background more clear so I can place myself on the setting. Maybe use 'like' instead of 'take' in the wording. Concept R fits best as I can place it in both an urban and a more outdoor nature setting.

There is an intense city life with a passion for good on the go coffee. Prepping your own filter coffee and having it on your way to work is very popular, there is a lot of waiting in traffic or long public transport times. The city can get claustrophobic quick so quite often you need to get out and recharge. Mountains occupy a third of the country, which means it's easy to get out for a trek on a weekend.",Splash,ENFP
301034,Renata,Porraz,renata.porraz@gmail.com,"Concept A 
Cold - Love it, the handle looks practical (usually it breaks in my Nalgene water bottles for example) and I could hang it in my backpack with a quickdraw. I imagine hiking or climbing with a lovely sun and still being able to drink cold refreshing water. 
Hot - Don't love the picture, still I appreciate the fact she is grabbing the thermo directly with her hand, feeling the warmth without getting burnt is nice.

Concept R
I don't feel appealed to the pictures, I think the shots are to narrow, I'd rather look a landscape. Also, the girl clothes catch my eyes more than the water bottle. About the text, what if you try to tlak about tea instead of coffee sometimes? I'm more into tea than coffee ;)

Concept S
My favourite! The pictures are absolutely breathtaking and the text is powerful too. Although you put the hot thermo on the cold spot... I totally see myself as the girl on the cliff. I like the wordplay ""Temperature-Sustainable"" it cathed my attention and makes me feel interested... does the product and the brand have more sustainable & eco-friendly characteristics? Cocept A
""La temperatura se mantiene sin importar a donde vayas""
""Termina el día con la temperatura con la que lo iniciaste""

Cocept R
""Pura y refrescante durante todo el día"" * Pure and refreshing
""El café se mantiene como lo tomas""

Cocept S
""Ahora la temperatura perfecta es sostenible""
""Refrescarse es sustentable"" *Refreshness 1.- Travel, happiness, introspecting, sports, girl power, nature, evolve, cold, hot, sunny, snowy, Orange & dry, Blue-green & sunny.
2.- As a girl, I can have adventures on my own travelling to beautiful natural places & Hydro Flask will be there accompanying for me.
3.- The thermo makes the temperature of the beverage stays as I want it to be for a long time.
4.- It expresses the idea clearly and in a more sensible way. The words that refer to ""sustainable or organic"" aspects are so mainstream right now.
5.- The imagery makes me relate the wording with the sustainability of the planet... I don't have clear if the product has characteristics or the brand has a production process that is really benefiting nature.
6.- I'd really love to see or read the benefits Hydro Flash brings to my (ours) planet :) 1.- the Sustainable concepts is ambiguous, stays in the air.
2.- Which are the real benefits or what makes this sustainable? Is just the fact that it ""keeps or maintains"" the temperature?
3.- I don't disagree with anything, this is my favourite concept :)
4.- In Spanish we don't say ""Temp"" as an abbreviation for temperature.
5.- The imagery is the best of this concept! makes me wanna do it! a)Wording- If (as a consumer) I bump into this advertisement, read the text and observe the picture, I'd feel attracted... but if I also see a fact of the sustainable, natural or organic benefits, I'll be a step closer to buy the product (for example the BPA free slogan of Nalgene)
b)Imagery - It's absolutely perfect! 1.- Adventure, girls, outdoors, active, nature, sports, friends, cold water, warm tea.
2.- If I get a Hydro Flask bottle, I'll have fun and adventures
2.- As a girl, I can have fun travelling and practising outdoor sports while doing this I can count on the water bottle or thermo of Hydro Flask.
4.- Wording- Very clear
5- Imagery-Gives me the idea of girls having adventures in outdoors 1.- The image on the right seems awkward.
2.- Is that brave or silly and risky? What does the bottle have to do with the whole scene? What does she has a bottle in her hand?
3.- I disagree with the right image, looks a bit fake.
4.- The wording is just fine ;)
5.- Again, the image on the right. a) Wording.- I wouldn't change anything, even if you read the text in a glimpse, you fully understand the message.
b) Imagery.- Show the girl in another scene, a safer one but that still shows the girl doing something RAD and making the thermo fit more naturally into the scene. 1.- Cold weather, Warmth of the body, wooden landscapes, jogging in the morning, walking in the park,  The vest and the jacket, 
2.- I could bring the thermo with my all day long to using in all sort of activities (going to work, taking a break, exercising, travelling, working...)
3.- The thermo keeps the beverage temparature for a long time.
4.- Excellent
5.- Poorly. The one in the right is a bit better.
6.- I'd like to see more of the product and less of the girl and her clothes. 1.- I think about the clothes (for example the Patagonia vest) and don't think about Hydro flash
2.- Is the only colour? How much is it? How durable is it? Does the paint scratch easily?
3.- I rather have coffee than tea
4.- ""Pure refreshment"" doesn't sound ""in"" when I translate it into Spanish.
5.- I can't find any negative connotation. a) Wording.- In the first sentence translated into Spanish, I'll write ""Pure & Refreshing"". Personally, I'll write ""Tea"" instead of ""Coffee"" in the sentence ""----- stays the way you like it""
b)Imagery - I'll change the shots, focusing on the thermo in order to steal attention from the girl and her clothes but maintaining the sense of warmth.
If the bottle is available in different colours,  I'll add them on the left side of the image. A Cold - Looks real, could be me you know? I think it could be closer to people, making it more real... looks like an Instagram photo someone took and shared, not like a model who was hired to pose.
S Hot (which is actually cold but you placed the images inverted as a mistake I guess...) It's very powerful, I totally see this image printed and showed in a bus stop for example.",Splash,
296555,Katie,McDonald,Kmmcdonald13@gmail.com,"1.	My initial reaction is a bit of confusion with the choice in colour. I also thought the copy was a bit hit and miss.
2.	I love the colour of blue that was chosen for the “cold” ads. Blue makes perfect sense to use when advertising a cold drink. However, using it to advertise a hot drink seems a bit…counterintuitive? I couldn’t come up with a better word so that will have to do. Using only blue doesn’t make for easy linking between the product and all of its uses. I think a better option would have been to go with a warmer colour background and/or bottle for the “hot” ads. As for the copy, Concept R is my favourite. Both lines of copy are clear and concise. Concept S I think will have a great appeal for your more “nature loving” clientele, and even appeal to those that wouldn’t consider themselves tree huggers, but still want to make small steps to bettering the planet. I think Concept A completely missed the mark. There are too many words, and “temperature” is too long of a word to be using, especially in an already long sentence. I had to re-read both the hot and cold ad a couple times to understand what it was saying.
3.	I want to know what the outside of the bottle feels like and what the mouth piece looks like. I speak English. :) 1.	Sustainability, saving the planet, hippies, tree huggers, nature lovers, hiking, being outside with nature, protecting our environment, cold water, cold drinks
2.	This product will keep your drink cold. This is a reusable water bottle. This is for people that like to hike or do other outdoor sports.
3.	Let’s save the planet and drink cold water.
4.	I think the wording does a great job at articulating the function of keeping drinks cold. There is nothing really indicating that it can keep drinks hot as well. 
5.	I think the images are great if you are talking about promoting sustainability. They show nature in pristine condition. The blue bottle and the blue background makes me feel cold so I would already assume that these bottles keep drinks cold. If you wanted to do a better job at conveying the function of keeping a drink warm, the bottle colour needs to change and/or the blue background needs to change to a warmer colour. 
6.	If the main focus of this campaign is sustainability, then I don’t think anything needs to be amplified. If you truly want to convey that drinks can stay hot, then I think changes need to be made to one, but not amplify what currently is there. 1.	The use of the colour blue when trying to promote a hot drink does not work well for me. I feel cold looking at it, but not in a way that it makes me want to use that bottle to drink something warm!
2.	I would want to know what material the bottle is made from, what the outside feels like and what the mouthpiece looks like.
3.	I don’t disagree with anything, I just don’t like the colour as mentioned previously.
4.	I think the wording sounds great. It is short and sweet but accurately conveys the message of being able to reuse the bottle to better the planet. 
5.	I think the images used are beautiful. They do a great job of promoting the natural beauty of Earth. As a consumer, seeing pristine images like this make me not want to pollute the earth with unnecessary waste. The only thing I might change would be in the “hot” ad. If there was a way to make it clear that the person pictured was drinking something hot, it would clear up any confusing. Possibly a person watching a sunrise over a beach or mountains where they would obviously be drinking coffee, maybe curled up in a blanket? Someone could be carrying the cup while visiting hot springs in winter? People tend to hold hot drinks, not throw them in a backpack. 1.	The colour blue: I would keep the “cold” ad as is. I would change the bottle colour and background colour to red for the “hot” ad. 
I would change the image of the “hot” ad to make it more obvious that the person pictured is drinking something hot. As stated previously, it would require a more zoomed in shot where it can clearly be seen that there is steam coming out of the mouth piece. I would also choose a setting that looks a lot colder and more wintery. That is just a dusting of snow on the current image. The image needs to be more than obvious that the weather is cold and anyone would be insane to drink something OTHER than a hot drink.
2.	A. I would make no changes to the wording.
B. See above to changes on imagery. 1.	Confusion; are they talking about air temperature?; I feel like I have to think and read way to much to understand these ads.
2.	If I didn’t already know what this product was, I genuinely don’t think I would be able to get a clear idea of what this is, other than a reusable water bottle for people who like to be outside.
3.	You can take these water bottles outside and with you on-the-go.
4.	I think the wording does a horrible job at explaining the temperature maintaining features of this product. 
5.	The images are fun, and it is made clear that these water bottles are to be taken on-the-go, but that’s about it.
6.	It’s hard to say what I would amplify in an ad that I don’t completely understand the concept of to start with. If you are trying to focus on being out-and-about and going all over the place in one day, then maybe a series of shots at multiple destinations would be better. I do like the selfie idea with the words “no matter where you go”. 1.	Pretty much the entire concept doesn’t work well for me unfortunately. Again, the shade of blue chosen does a great job at associating cold with the product, but this is not ideal for selling the concept of keeping drinks hot. Seeing the word “temperature” makes me want to skim over all of the copy because it is too much effort to read all of that when I’m not actually seeking out the ad. The girl in the “hot” ad is holding her drink sideways. I realize that these bottles won’t leak (or shouldn’t anyway), but even when we as consumers know that, would you still hold your hot drink sideways? I sure wouldn’t; my subconscious tells me to keep it upright.
2.	What is special about this water bottle? How is it different from any other stainless steel (if that’s even what it’s made of) water bottle?
3.	I only disagree with the fact the girl is holding a hot drink sideways. Everything else I just don’t really like.
4.	The word temperature is too long. For whatever reason I am thinking that the wording is referring to air temperature. 
5.	The imagery for me doesn’t really reflect the words, and I am not sure what the words are trying to say. This whole concept just doesn’t work for me. I am not really sure how to answer these questions as I am unclear as to what the whole concept is behind this campaign. Is it to focus on the drink temperature or the mobility of the product? These are ideas that quickly popped into my head (and I am clearly not a professional):
“Cold” ad: keep the image and change the words. “Drink temp on point. Selfie game on point. #letsgo”
“Cold” ad: keep the copy, change the image. Well, sort of keep the copy. “The drink temp stays no matter where you go.” Image needs to be someone physically doing something and moving across terrain, where that be by biking, running, skiing, rock climbing, etc.
All “Hot” ads: change bottle and background to a warm colour such as red. 
The copy doesn’t make sense when talking about a hot drink. I don’t think anyone would be drinking the same cup of coffee at 8:00p.m. that they were drinking at 8:00a.m. Maybe that’s just me. My best suggestion for this ad is to start over. Sorry. 1.	Helps me when I am thirsty; it can keep my drinks hot; I will feel refreshed using this; this is a really nice water bottle.
2.	This bottle will keep my cold drinks cold and my hot drinks hot.
3.	This bottle will keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. (Exactly what I said it implies without being said!)
4.	The wording is spot on for the main idea. The use of “coffee” is great for implying its use for hot drinks.
5.	The images are good. I like that she is actually drinking. The “hot” image works well because she looks like she is wearing more casual clothes which typically would be when people have hot drinks (as in, not when adventuring). Similarly, the athletic clothes work well for wanting refreshment. 
6.	To amplify the concept of the cold drink, I would probably have that same sort of shot, but change her clothes. She is dressed too warmly to be needing a cool and refreshing drink, even through she is in athletic gear. If you are wearing a puffy vest because of cold weather, chances are good that you don’t want an ice cold drink. Cool yes, but not ice cold. 1.	The image of the “cold” ad is the only one that I may change. Her surroundings look cold. When my surroundings are cold, I don’t necessarily think “Hmm…I need pure refreshment.” However, when I am in the beating sun or sweating bullets from a group fitness class, you can bet I want an ice cold drink.
2.	The only question I have it “She looks cold. Why would she be drinking something cold?”
3.	I only disagree in the choice of clothing.
4.	As previously mentioned, I do not associate needing “pure refreshment” and puffy vests.
5.	In this image, I would at least remove her vest, if not have her in more summery-type athletic wear. Adding some sweat on the forehead wouldn’t hurt either. The hotter her surroundings can look, the more your audience will believe that she needs a cold drink. 1.	As stated on the previous question: In this image, I would at least remove her vest, if not have her in more summery-type athletic wear. Adding some sweat on the forehead wouldn’t hurt either. The hotter her surroundings can look, the more your audience will believe that she needs a cold drink.
2.	A. I would leave the wording (on both) as I think it fits the function of the bottle.
B. Other than the clothing mentioned above, the only other change I would make would be to the colour and background of the bottle in the “hot” image. As with all of the concepts, I think these would have a greater impact in selling the function of the bottle if featured in a warm colour. I would definitely choose Concept R. I think this is the most effective campaign in getting across the message of the function of the bottle. Living in Australia, our summers are HOT. We are all looking for a way to get drinks cold and keep them cold (and we are big drinkers so the ones for beer and wine would be very successful). In addition to needing drinks kept cold, Australians LOVE their coffee. All day, every day. The fact that the ad actually says “coffee” will capture people’s attention and spark their interest. I have a Yeti that my parents sent me from the States and EVERYONE I tell about it is thoroughly impressed. I have seen on your website that you have a small presence in Aus. If you were to grow and expand here, I think you will be widely successful because as far as I know, there is not a mainstream product quite like it yet.",Splash,
296564,Liz,Eve,lizzieeve@gmail.com,"What is your initial reaction? - why are the hot and cold different bottles? Do you need two bottles? I don't like the colour or graphic
What do you like? What don't you like? I like the images in concept S, prefer the text in concept A
What would you like to know more about after seeing the concepts? could one bottle hold both hot and cold drinks? what is the difference? Can the hot drink holder not be tipped?  Thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not. 
Environmental protection, corporate responsibility, global warming/climate change

What does it imply that is not said explicitly? 
...that using the flask helps to protect the environment, or that using the flask keeps you going on an adventure

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence.
Stay refreshed on your adventures, sustainably.

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
I studied psychology and work as a copywriter. In my professional opinion, It does articulate clearly but doesn't conjure the sensation of using the product or invite action...
I suggest: ""Now warm temperatures can be sustainable"" and ""Cool refreshment can be sustainable"". This way the message is evocative also a call to action as it implies the question 'are you drinking from a sustainable vessel?'

How well does the imagery convey the main idea? I like the imagery. For the hot drink, I'd choose a snowier colder toned image - for example in a forest and I would have the person larger so you can see the product - the size of the person in the second image is perfect showing the product tucked in the backpack

Thinking about all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why? I'd like to see the viewpoint/experience of the person/viewer emphasized What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? Sustainable is a much-used word. In many cases, it is used questionably by corporations to advance sales without making a real difference to the environment.
What questions does it raise? What is the flask made out of, was it fairly produced, has it been manufactured in China?
What things do you disagree with? 
Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right? answered in previous question
What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations? The blue colour I associate with chemicals for example gas canisters and chlorinated swimming pools. It depends if the eco-credentials of the product go beyond just that it helps people avoid plastic waste? Are the materials interesting or is the manufacturing done in a waste free or fair way?

Change the image for the hot drink to a colder looking image and show the person and product more clearly

Change the text to: Now warm temperatures can be sustainable. and Cool refreshment can be sustainable. 1. Fun, outdoors, youth, self-expression, selfishness, adventure
2. Using this bottle is going to be fun
3. Adventurous lifestyles need home comforts
4. Why not make the text simpler to understand - Stays cool no matter where you go, Still piping hot at the end of the day.
How well does the imagery convey the main idea? The bus image is a bit crazy, I'm not sure if the bus is moving or still, it looks kind of dangerous - perhaps that is the point - danger and adventure. I think maybe I want to see them enjoying the drinks not so obviously posing with them. 
What would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why? The comfort/refreshment factor involved in imbibing the drinks. If you're talking about the end of the day - why not a dramatic dusk image? The first image should illustrate the idea better of having many options in where you go - what about a city view - you can see some amazing views from the city walls and hills around Granada, Spain for example... I want to shoot this myself now!! 1. I like the concept of adventure, fun and convenience, but perhaps it doesn't highlight the sustainable argument for the product
2. Is the product suitable for me if I'm not young and attractive?
What things do you disagree with? I find the logo combined with these images to be a bit childlike, so it doesn't appeal to me as a product
Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right? Just using the word temperature is a bit vague.
What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations? The models look very young and I don't really identify with them. You can't see enough of the location to make it interesting, they look a bit posed or fake - this works in the first image as it looks like an Instagram shot, but in the second image it looks a little awkward. I think you could use words that evoke hot or cold drinks and the experience of drinking them. I would look at different ways to show the product in the photography, the images should look more epic. It looks too budget, but I guess it depends on the price point of the flask? 1. enjoyment, pleasure, self-determination, health, fitness
2. The product is part of a healthy lifestyle and increases pleasure
3. The Hydro Flask is a healthy and has a strong hedonic or sensual component
4. The wording is simple and upfront, on re-reading it seems a little suggestive
5.  The imagery definitely supports the main idea
6. I don't think amplification would be good Maybe it's too sensual, it could show a bit more context and more dimensions of the product
questions  - I can't think of any
I'm not sure if I want to focus on this aspect of the bottle - something about the presentation is slightly uncomfortable.
The first text sounds ok, the second I'm not sure if I like the word 'take' I would maybe replace it with 'like'.
I think the close-cropped focus on the woman is a bit intense, I would like to see more of the environment - to know more about what she is doing and put her in context, she seems slightly objectified. how about 'Cool refreshment all day long' and 'Coffee stays the way you like it'
More context and environment in the image, the first image should maybe look warmer - the coat suggests it's pretty cold if she is running - so a cold drink is less inviting. Her outfit in the second photo doesn't look too good - maybe due to the way it is shot... Concept R - with modifications, it's the most direct, it leaves me with fewer questions about the brand.  It would be nice to see more environmental images that imply a sustainable lifestyle and add context and a story to the woman in the image.
I wanted the sustainable branding to work, but I can't see enough transparency about the product on the website, it doesn't seem like a completely sustainable brand - just one that would like to be seen as sustainable. I still have questions about the manufacture and materials... eg what is the cap made out of and where are the bottles manufactured?

I noticed some out of date text on the website: ""2015 we expanded in Europe, with plans to go worldwide by the end of 2016.""",Splash,
301044,Maude,Sweeney ,maudesweeney@gmail.com,"I think the brand and imagery are good. Very active and outdoorsy. Concepts A is a bit generic, but R makes me think that people who live in the city will consider the bottles as part of their routine, like Mon - Fri and on the weekends. Concepts S make it look very suited to weekend trips only? I don't like the copy at all. In Concepts A it is hard to know what you mean by 'Temperature' - like you don't think of the bottle you think of air temperature. Concept S is way too vague - sustainability in a single bottle is also like you are stretching to fit with the sustainability trend right now. Concept Rs copy is the most clear in the phrase 'all day long' and the word 'stays'. English is my native language. Thoughts and associations : imagry - weekend trips, getting away from it all, nature. copy - sustainable implies being environmental and reusable. 
Implies : this product is good for the environment, and is for people who like the environment / outdoors. 
Main idea for the concept : If you like the environment, and spending time in it, you should buy this bottle. 
How well does the wording articulate the main idea : not very well. 'Sustainable' is too vague and trendy. 
How well does the imagery convey the main idea: Imagery is great, invokes a outdoorsy vibe.    
Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why? The copy - 'perfect temp' and 'refreshment' are weak. Copy like 'Keeps your drink the right temperature all day, no matter where you are' is very blunt but at least people understand what the product is and does. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? The copy. 
What questions does it raise? What does the product do? 
What things do you disagree with? There is nothing to disagree with, because I do not have a clear idea of what the product does. 
Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right? It is all vague. Its not that it doesn't sound right - it just sounds like nothing at all. Like filler copy. 
What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations? The imagery is good. Not unattainable like real photos that real people take which I like. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them? I would change the copy. 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one? 

Changes to the wording? Yes. I would be explicit about what the product does and then refer to the concept of the photo. So 'Keep your drink warm while you get lost in the cold' or 'Keep your drink cold while you work up a sweat.' 

Changes to the imagery? Nope. All good there. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  Young brand. Oudoorsy. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly? This brand is for young people. 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Honestly I don't really get any main idea. Something to do with young people. 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea? It doesn't. It is very vague. 'temperature' makes me think of the air, the room... not the bottles. 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea? Again its all too vague. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why? The copy needs to be more specific. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not. This brand is for young people, I would probably ignore it. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly? Youth? 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence.  I can't think of a single main concept. 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea? It doesn't. Not to me anyway. 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea? Very well if the brand if focused on young people. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?  The copy needs to be more detailed. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them? Just change the copy. Make it more clear and focussed on the product itself. 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one? Pictures are fine if you are focused on a younger audience. It also seems very occasional, like this does not make me think I would use it week to week - only on 'adventures'. 

Changes to the wording? Big changes. Be more specific about what temperature you are referring to. Something more like 'Hot or cold, bring your favorite drink with you.' 

Changes to the imagery? I don't know that people take photos presenting their water bottles with such enthusiasm? Maybe something a bit more realistic and less product placed. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  Usable. Practical. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly? You can use this product Mon - Fri at work OR on the weekends. 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. Every day use bottles. 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea? 'all day long' is good, makes it applicable to any day / every day. 'Pure refreshment' means nothing to me. 'stays the way you take it' does not make much sense to me? 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea? Very well. This resonates with me and I think she looks like someone using the bottle on her way to work, on the weekend, after a run... wherever - she is just a normal person using it the way I would use it. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?  Clarity in the language. It is still unclear from the copy alone what the product IS or DOES. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? The copy. 

What questions does it raise? If I had not been told that this research is for a bottle that keeps its contents hot or cold I would not know. 

What things do you disagree with? The vagueness of it all! 'stays the way' means nothing to me. 'pure refreshment' does not imply the temperature of the contents... in fact it could mean that the bottle 'purifies' the water inside it? 

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right? All. Of. It. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations? No I like her. She could be on her way to anything so she could be me or one of my friends. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them? Just the copy, again! 

What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?

Changes to the wording? Change 'Pure refreshment all day long' to something like 'A bottle of ice cold refreshment ready when you are.' and change 'Coffee stays the way you take it' to 'Keep your morning coffee hot til lunch, or whenever you finally get round to it.'   

Changes to the imagery? Nope, all good. Concepts R because I think she is very accessible and she implies that you can use the product all day every day, city / outdoors / on the way to work / working out... but the copy still doesn't work.",Splash,

2. Pro: I like the young, dynamic and active, environmentally-conscious vibe. Con: Some of the images look semi-professional. Also, most of the pictures are (i.m.o) not very strong. They do not convey strong feelings, a strong relation to the situation and thus an attachment to the product. Additionally, to me, the words of the concepts R and S are not only unclear but also do not point to the special and rather unique feature of hydro flask bottles, which is keeping the temperature. Thus, it is not clear to me, why I should decide for Hydro Flask rather than another brand.
3. How does the temperature stay the same for so long? How does it function specifically? Can I use the same bottle for hot as well as cold drinks? Do the bottles come in other colors than blue? And why is using Hydro Flask sustainable? Because I avoid plastic or is there more behind it? Is the production e.g. sustainable? 1. 
Concepts A: 
Cold: Die Temperatur bleibt, egal wo du hingehst.  Hot: Beende den Tag mit der Temperatur, mit der du begonnen hast.
Concepts R: 
Cold: Pure Erfrischung, den ganzen Tag. Hot: Der Kaffee bleibt so, wie du ihn mitgenommen hast.
Concepts S:
Cold (Hot?): Jetzt ist die perfekte Temperatur nachhaltig. Hot(Cold?): Erfrischung ist nachhaltig.

2. Not sure what you mean, but: some sentences could need a bit of ""adaptation"" to maintain the original meaning, e.g. Concept A: Cold: Die Temperatur bleibt DIESELBE, egal wo du hingehst. (The temperature stays THE SAME, no matter where you go). For Concept R, Hot, the literal translation would rather be: Der Kaffee bleibt in der Art und Weise wie du ihn nimmst. It is unclear to me, whether the English version is supposed to mean, that the coffee stays the way you like it. Or if it stays the the way it was when you e.g. left the house, so, when you took it with you. Depending on the meaning, the translation varies. 1a) cold, nature, USA, fresh air. What is the person doing? Is he/she on a walk, hiking? Alone b) summer, traveling, hiking, beauty of nature, tranquility, health, thirst.
2a) perfect temperature for a drink in this moment is hot. Using hydro flask is sustainable. b) It implies that in a situation like this, one wants to be refreshed, preferably with a cold drink; and that one can refresh oneself whilst being sustainable. 
3.For a and b: I believe that the main idea behind the creation of the concepts is to address people that want to pursue a sustainable lifestyle and convince them that by using a Hydro Flask bottle they can do so.
4a) Imo, not so well. Without any background knowledge, it is unclear, which perfect temperature is spoken of (outside temp?) and what temperature and sustainability has to do with a bottle b) Good.
5a) Not so well. Yes, there is nature on the image. But what is the person doing, why would it need a drink in this situation? b) very well. Becomes clear, that in a situation like this one would need a refreshment; better take a HF than a plastic bottle.
6a)The feeling, WHY I would need a hot drink in this situation and the pleasure associated to it (e.g. person sitting on a trunk, warming hands on bottle, steam coming out)b)Maybe the feeling of heat explaining why I would need a cold drink in particular 1. a) It leaves too many question marks. You first have to understand that the HF bottle can keep your DRINK at perfect temperature, that in a situation like this, one might like to have a hot drink and that by using HF you can be sustainable. Maybe focus on ONE aspect e.g. sustainability. b) The fact that HF keeps your cold drink cold (not necessarily cold).
2. For both a and b) Is using Hydro Flask sustainable because it avoids plastic? Or is there more behind it? Is the production e.g. sustainable? And why should I buy Hydro Flask and not another bottle?
3. It is not the perfect temp that is sustainable but using HF. Refreshment can be and is not necessarily sustainable.
4. See 3.
5. Especially the first image is not as good as it could be. Compare answers of task 2. In addition: Maybe the bottle should be shown more. For image 2: The feeling of refreshment could be conveyed in a stronger way (e.g. conveying a stronger feeling of heat). However, Imo it is also fine to focus on one aspect, namely sustainability. Taking 1 and 2 together:
a) Maybe one could be more precise in the wording. Not talk about perfect temp, but ""a warming in the cold"", a ""hot drink"" etc.. Or otherwise, the image could convey the longing and pleasure of a hot drink more e.g. a person sitting on a tree trunk, warming his or her hands on bottle, hot steam coming out of the bottle (cf. answer task 2). Also, to me the image appears semi-professional. What could be further enhanced is the ""posture"" of the person. Right now it appears a bit cumbersome. Depending on the target audience, the person could be shown more agile (while maintaining the tranquility) and content. 
b) In my opinion, the wording is fine. One could potentially think of changing it to ""refreshment can be sustainable"". If something ""is"" sustainable why then change something? If it ""can be"" sustainable then it is up to you to take action. As already mentioned before, the image could potentially convey a stronger longing for a cold drink e.g. by using a ""sunnier"" image, one that is not so foggy. 1. a) summer, hiking, sports, happiness, selfie, energy b) road trip, camping, tranquility, company, breathing fresh air through your lungs
2. a) HF keeps your drink cold even if it's hot outside. b) That HF keeps your hot drink hot for a day.
3. a) With HF, even if you're on the go, you can enjoy your drinks at your desired temperature.
4. a) Imo, very well. It stresses reliance/constancy and mobility/spontaneity at the same time. b) Very well.
5. a) Quite well. It conveys the feeling of spontaneity, movement, heat and need for refreshment. b) IMO it conveys the monolith aspect quite well. I can imagine the person being on a long ride. However, although there is snow, it does not convey a strong feeling of coldness.
6) a) and b) Looking back at my initial notes, my first impulse for both images was, that they don't really catch me. Especially, because I could neither ""feel"" the heat nor the cold. 1. a) I suppose the image's ""selfie-style"" was meant to create some kind of connection. However, to me it just looks unprofessional. b) Cool pic, but it does not create a feeling of ""Hey, I would love to have a hot drink in a situation like this"".
2. a) How long does the temperature ""stay""? b) How much fits into one bottle?
3. a) No disagreement, really. b) That the girl sits on the driver's seat and is not driving :D.
4. a) and b) Not that it doesn't sound right, but if you only take the words, one could also think that with in a) ""temperature"" refers to outside temperature (which is not wrong) and in b) same thing, or that it's about one's own temperature. Not that it's not understandable, but particularly with b) I can imagine that it is not so self-evident in the first few seconds what is actually referred to. 
5) Not that it is really a negative connotation, but the first image seems like a poser picture, like a blogger that got the bottle for free and now has to post a picture to show how cool it is. Let me try to put this in other words. It seems like the pic is taken to show off with the bottle, but it is not a natural scene. It seems ""misappropriated"". Comprehensible? b) It could convey a stronger feeling of ""cold"". 1 + 2 
a) If possible, show the bottle ""in action"", in natural use (although I can imagine, that - even if not me - other young girls can relate to the picture's overall style)
b) Put down the sleeve and give her a woolen cap. 
In my opinion, the wording is good. 1. a) autumn walk, weekend, unpleasant weather, hills, nature, thirst b) autumn day, weekend walk, pleasure, pausing in, tranquility, park
2. a) That a cold drink is the way to ""best"" refresh. b) That you prefer to take your coffee hot ? 
3. For both concepts I can assume the main idea for the concept is to convey a feeling, namely how HF can satisfy your daily needs.
4. a) Supposing 3, the wording is fine. b) Supposing 3, the wording of b is too rational/functional. 
5. a) It does convey the feeling of being refreshed. Although it looks so cold in the pic, I'm not sure, I'd like to have a cold drink; rather room-temperature. But I mean, no one said, you're only allowed to have ice-cold drinks from your HF. b) I can definitely feel the enjoyment of having a coffee.
6. a) I would like to see the daily routine aspect amplified. All the other concepts showed rather ""extraordinary"" situations - things that you would rather do on holidays or weekends. I could potentially imagine the woman doing her morning workout - although if looking at my associations it rather appears like a long weekend walk - but then the wording ""all day long"" somehow doesn't fit. b) Same: Daily routine aspect. There's nothing greater than having the opportunity to take your hot coffee with you in the mornings when your off to work and enjoy it while continuing to wake up in the bus/underground. 1. a) (Maybe this was not the intention, but) this is not what I would be doing all day long, especially on a daily basis. b) The pleasure combined with the rational wording.
2. a) What is she doing outside all day long? Is there enough capacity to hydrate me all day long? Where did she put this huge bottle? Is she holding it in her hands? b) My coffee stays the way it was when I had taken it with me? Or does it stay the way I like to drink it. I guess this is a linguistic/translation problem, but the wording is unclear to me. Where is this girl? Is she in a park? Is it a week day, weekend?
3. a) That the amount suffices to keep me refreshed ""all day long"" b) It is not a disagreement, rather a disbelieve that my coffee would actually stay warm. 
4. a) none b) compare answer 2. 
5. Imo both images should rather show daily situations (in a better way). See answer Task 4 a) The wording and the image taken for itself are good. But in combination, they do not work that well. Right now, I think of a weekend day-long walk in the countryside. Which is alright. But I think by showing some kind of daily situations, people could relate more. If you want to keep the wording, why not show the woman in the gym, after a morning run, in the office, at university...situations in daily life, in which you're on the go, but need to stay hydrated. 
b) Similar holds true for the second image. Show more of the situation the person is in. Especially without the text, I imagined the girl sitting on a balcony, having a walk in the park drinking tea. It does not have to be a hectic scene, but especially when it comes to coffee, why not show a daily situation e.g. her walking to the office (she might be walking, but I cannot see it). She could have her earphones on, a backpack, something that shows she is going somewhere. And it's supposed to be a quiet scene e.g. on the weekend, why not create an image of her sitting in the park e.g. on the weekend, listening to music, reading, drinking her coffee...The situation has to be created more vividly around the text (which could be more ""emotional"" and less unclear). Concept R: 
It really depends on the season, but right now, I guess one could align most to the rather frosty weather the images convey. They seem grounded (which a lot of Germans are) not too crazy and also a bit urban (at least more than the others).

But in the end, it would really be a mix of all of them (Sustainability is e.g. a big topic in Germany (concept S) and traveling or outdoor sports as well (concept A))",Splash,
296560,Thomas,Bonnin,tbonni900e@gmail.com,"1. I think the blue part takes too much space. Or that it doesn't blend too well with the image on the right. It is very adventure oriented, it doesn't look like a product targeted for the daily routine. 
The sustainable bit surprised me, in the sense that I wouldn't associate ""temperature-keeping"" flasks as unsustainable in the first place, so I don't really know what type of product it opposes to. 
The R campaign is the one I find the most visually attractive. 

2. I like the design of the bottle, though I think that something is off with the background. Maybe it is too similar to the color of the bottle. It doesn't structure the bottle as much as I would like it. 
I think that the landscapes used are nice, but are drawing a little too much on the ""adventure lifestyle"" cliché. As in my initial reaction, I think that I would be more tempted by something more mundane. 
I'm still not overly impressed with the texts so far. I think ever something more fun, or something sharper, could be obtained. 
Actually, it strikes me that one the bottle shape really reminds me of a deodorant spray, if you see what I mean. 

3. I'd like to know more about what makes the product more sustainable than others on the market. I'd be curious of the texture of the bottle, actually. [] signals additions from the English original. 
Concert A 
A: La température reste [la même] où que vous alliez. 
=> I notice there's a pun with stays/go, but I think it would sound really odd in French to keep it. 
B: Finissez la journée à la même température que vous l'avez débutée. 

Concept R 
A: Un rafraichissement parfait, toute la journée. 
B: Un café comme s'il venait d'être servi.
=> Odd one to translate, this is the one I would come up with. 

Concept S
A: A parfaite température, et maintenant durable. 
B: Se rafraîchir de manière durable. 
=> I don't know if ""durable"" would be THE word for sustainable, maybe ""écologique"" would be more handy, but then it is more politically loaded. ""Sustainable development"" is notoriously difficult to translate into French. Left panel
1. That's a beautiful landscape, though strangely it looks as it would not be associated with cold weather. Maybe the colour of the rocks does that. Now I see also the puny association between ""perfect temperature"" and ""climate change"". 
2. A hot drink is not going to ruin these fragile and beautiful landscapes. 
3. Here's a bottle that respects the environment and keeps your drink warm. 
4. It does this pretty straightforwardly. 
5. The focus is quite away from the product. So we get more curious about the landscape than the bottle. 
6. The image might make it clearer that it is about the product, or what is sustainable about the product. 

Right panel
1. Makes me think of Cornwall. I'm shared between a sustainable-oriented product text and an image that is more geared toward individual freedom. 
2. You can go on adventure and enjoying without costing much to the environment. 
3. Go get some wildlife fun, it's guilt-free! 
4. It's a little more abstract, because the text is really short. It leaves a bit more for us to consider. 
5. The focus is nicely put on the product, and it keeps a beautiful panorama of the landscape. 
6. The sustainable part is not super clear. 1. The product is not visible on the left image. You get more of a sense of individual adventures than sustainability. 
2. Why is it sustainable? Why more than other products of this type? Where are these landscapes from? How can I go? 
3. Nothing in particular. 
4. I've never used ""perfect temp"" in english, but I guess this works. Though it sounds odd. Maybe the one on the right is too broad. So broad that it is hard to know what it contrasts with? Other products of the similar type? Other types of drinks-carrying device?
5. Individual travelling to discover wild places can also be associated with a degradation of these landscapes, or the problems associated with the transports associated with accessing such places (especially when it is done via planes). It might bring some tension with the sustainable message it tries to paint. Plus, we don't get to know what's more sustainable about the product. 1. Hard to say! It would be nice to have a more obvious association between the sustainable concept and the images. 
2. a. The two panels give the impression that having a perfect temperature drink sustainably was impossible before, which sounds odd to me, at least not obvious. ""Keep a perfect temp sustainably"", ""Sustainable refreshment""? 
b. On the left I think the landscape is too present and the product not enough. I think the focus being on the person works a lot better on the right. I'm not exactly sure how I would convey the ""sustainable"" image better with images though... Left
1. The image makes me feel more like she's in a partying dress. The movement with the outstretched arm doesn't feel very natural. The message and the product on the left gives the impression of reliability. 
2. Keeping your drink fresh can help you having a heck of a time. 
3. Here's a reliable bottle, wherever you take it. 
4. It emphasizes reliability fairly well. 
5. The image does not do that so well. At least it doesn't feel very natural. 
6. On a similar ""wild"" landscape, it would work better with something like concept R, where you sense that someone is doing an effort and is in need of a drink. 

Right
1. That must be a long and somewhat uncomfortable travel, if it takes a whole day to get there. It must be really cold out there, it's strange that she's hanging out of the car like this. 
2. Having this bottle can make you feel cosy on long days. 
3. Here's a reliable bottle for hot drinks in long days. 
4. I'm somewhat confused by the sentence, I'm not sure what but it doesn't feel fully comfortable. 
5. The image gives both the image of an adventure, but not of a craving need for having a comfy drink on a long day.
6. I'd like something that gives more the ""cosy"" feelings of having a hot drink after a long travel. Left
1. The image doesn't feel very natural. I mean, I'm not fond of selfies so they always somewhat feel overly posed. And also it doesn't really look like she's in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't look like she's on a path or something like that. 
2. Is it easy to carry? Is it convenient to pack in a bag? 
3. Nothing much. 
4. It works fairly well. 
5. Apart from what I've said in 1), nothing else to add. 

Right
1. The sentence still bugs me out, it doesn't feel right, gramatically speaking, it seems like it's missing something. The image also seems disassociated with the main message. 
2. Is this a drink? Is this a spray? It's not obvious that she's holding a drinks bottle. 
3. N/A
4. I see what you try to say here, though I don't think it's perfectly formulated. 
5. The imagery seems disconnected with the message. Having a hot drink in a long day could be something more heart-warming, here it feels weirdly adventurous. 1. I would make more natural situations in both cases. 
2. a. The left slogan seems fine, but the right one doesn't feel quite right. I would go for something more like ""keeps your tea warm for these long days"". 
b. On the left, I would go for something more emphasizing that she's taking a challenging walk, that it is fun, but that she would enjoy a refreshment. It's nearly as if it could like there's a cold mojito in the bottle and that she could be in a rave party somewhere in the woods. 
On the right, if you keep this setup I would make her enjoy the hot drink in a comfy setup in the car. Or sitting on a table on the side of the road, with a beautiful landscape behind. Something of the sort. Left panel
1. Durability, something stable and secure, something that remains intact and reliable. 
2. That you can rely on the bottle to keep you refreshed. That you're taking a quality product for ""quality exercise"". The whole wildlife and the Patagonia jacket gives the impression that the brand is somewhat high-market. 
3. Here's a reliable bottle that's going to keep your product absolutely intact for a day. 
4. I think it does well in making clear the qualities of the product. 
5. The association of ""refreshment"" and the image is not directly obvious, since she doesn't seem to be in a particularly hot environment. But it gives the impression that she's in a hike or another long effort, then the need for reliable source of refreshment makes sense. 
6. I don't know actually, the more I see the more I think the association works fairly well. 

Right panel
1. It gives a fairly springy image. I often associate coffee with a urban/office lifestyle, so it makes me think that the person is walking in the streets. 
2. It conveys the impression that the bottle is easy to carry around, and convenient in a busy schedule (which is why you would need to take coffee away). 
3. Keep your coffee warm for your everyday life. 
4. The wording works straightforwardly. 
5. It works as well, though it looks more like the person is walking in a park. 
6. Maybe emphasize a bit more on a work situation? 1. I'm still not convinced by the amount of space the blue parts take. I think that the products are well presented on the images on the right. 
2. Actually, for the left I would be wondering about the size, if it is big enough to really go on a ""all-day-long adventure"". On the right, I would be wondering about how easy it is to clean, if you fill it often with coffee. 
3. N/A 
4. I think the wording is fairly straightforward, maybe too straightforward? 
5. The imagery (especially left) might make it appear as a fairly high-end product. It depends then how you want to brand it. If this is the targeted market, then it works. No negative connotations I can think of. 1. I would keep only the right parts on each panel, or diminish the size of the left one. Make the bottle more salient on the left side. 
2. a. Maybe something more in line with the image on the right. Like ""still fresh off the bottle after a 800m climb"" on the left or ""Make your coffee at 9am, enjoy it at 11am"" or something of the sort. I think this could make it sharper and easier for the public to identify with the situation. Concepts R: I think these are the ones that work the best for me. And I think it would suit the taste of French people the best out of the three. The last one is too loosely bound to sustainability (and these flasks are often branded as eco-friendly in the first place) to work too well. The first one has an aesthetic that I think would work better on the Anglo-American market than the French one.",Splash,
301040,Marc,Durhoff,Marcdurhoff@hotmail.com,"It’s all about sustainability these days so option 3 would be my choice from an advertisement perspective. Keeping a drink hot or cold however us not sustainability is it isn’t combined with focus on reusable flask '- Temperaturen är samma oavsett vart du tar vägen
- Avsluta dagen med samma temperatur som du påbörjade med
- Ren förfriskning hela dagen lång
- Kaffet är samma som när du bryggde det
- nu är temperaturen hållbar
- förfriskning är hållbart' I like these ads more than the two previous. Add one focuses on outdoor activity in the cold and indicates a satisfying warm drink at the end of a trekk. Ad number 2 is also better as it shows how easy it us to attach the flask to a backpack and bring along. The only potentially ”negative” part is that the two ads focus on outdoor activity. The flasks can just as easily be used for indoor activity, sitting in a cabin or stan indoor tennis game. The add make sense but do not necessarily stand out (which would be the case if you had s picture of a broken down car in a snowstorm and a person sitting there despondent but drinking coffee from the flask, keeping warm while waiting for rescue...) Less conservative and ”boring” images. As to my previous example - gould have a broken down car in a dnowstorm with a guy drinking coffee from the flask waiting for rescue. That’s an interesting story. Could have someone walking around in the desert, apparently lost and hot drinking cold water fyom the flask. Both if these ads look rather stupid from a picture perspective. Why would you take a selfie that focuses on the flask. Why is she hanging outside the car window - neither safe nor legal snd what does it have to do with the oroduct? The main idea is ”Young, positive and adventurous activity” but text and pictures do not go hand in hand Text and pictures are not linked. Why take a selfie that focuses on your flask? Why hang outside a car window - not safe or legal and has nothing to do with the drink or flask. Negative association at best. Does not look like the picture in the second image related to ”finish the day...” First text would be better linked to a picture if a warm/sweating person taking a break from activity to cool down (think old time Coca Cola ads). Second image us just bad from all perspective - from a text perspective the image does not indicate ”finish the day...” snd if it us cold why is she hanging outside the window..? Or she needs a coffee because she had been hanging outside the window...? Outdoor activity, thirst. First image for me indicates cold drink during activity and the second image indicates warm drink at end of (outdoor) activity. Imagery goes hand in hand with pictures. For the cold drink piece It may also be nice to see the fkadk just attached to a belt or likewise when walking, Running or skiing to indicate that it us easy to bring along on an activity. Everyone already knows you drink from a flask.. I will have yo revers back to my previous comment - in the image snowing cold drink I do bot think the focus needs yo be on drinking in the picture but rather how easy it us yo bring along during a hike, skiing or climbing. A picture where the flask is attached to a belt or strap or similar would be more interesting Again going back to my previous comment I would change the picture on the cold drink to someone hiking, skiing or tick climbing and just focus on how easy it us to bring with a picture of the flask attached to a belt, strap or similar. Everyone knows you drink from a flask - but how difficult is it to bring along on anactivity? Concept S. The images work well with the pictures snd the outdoor activity related to actual scenery in the Nordic countries. It focuses on (young) outdoor activity, popular in the Nordics",Splash,

COLD: Smiling in the shadow, does not seem like she needs a cold drink. HOT: What if she drops it from the bus? Is she driving!? Do not get the text on HOT? Temp you startet? When pouring in it’s boiling I want it drinkable. 
Blue bottle and background, item melts to become invisible. 

R
COLD: “All day long” sounds like a long day at work, but she is on a hike? Commercial for Patagoinia with the colorful vest. The text for HOT is super confusing, what does it mean? Also, she does not look like she’s having coffee but water. Can you have different beverages in the bottles? Like the color saturation in this image. 

S
COLD beverage but snow on the image? Also, person melts into background and the image has nothing to do with a bottle? Where is the bottle even? HOT beverage but hiking up a mountain with a t-shirt? Makes no sense. However love the image and the small bottle in the backpack. Inspirational.
Different bottle for HOT/COLD compared to other concepts, reason? Change to “Sustainable refreshment.”. Maybe the HOT/COLD is not the temp for beverage now after all?confusing. To Swedish. 

A
COLD - Samma temperatur, var du än går. 
HOT - Avsluta dagen som du började den. 

R
COLD - Uppfriskande hela dagen. 
HOT - Kaffet precis som du vill ha det. (I think the sentence in Eng is weird so had a hard time translating this, but changes into something like: ""coffee just the way you want it"". Still NOT ideal in my opinion, but.)

S
COLD - Nu är även temperaturen hållbar (hard to translate to changed to something like ""now also the temperature is sustainable"")
HOT - Förfriskningar som är hållbara (Literary ""refreshments that are sustainable"", super weird to say in Swedish, but I have no idea how else to translate this, could even be ""Förfriskningar som är sustainable"" since sustainable is a commonly used word in Swedish too these days) What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
I associate this with hiking trips, like I am going exploring, travelling, when on the move. I also associate this with sustainability in terms of taking care of the climate. Bringing your own reusable bottle that will sustain the temperature for youl. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
Bring your bottle when you are travelling and you can make sure both you and your beverage is “sustainable”. 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Sustainability for both your beverage and our planet. 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
By using the word sustainable, I would say pretty good. But shortening temperature to temp for instance for just shortening the sentence without purpose is strange. The second is better. 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
For the first image - not well at all. But the second image - great! 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Given I have interpreted it correct, the presence of the bottle in the first image most of all. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
The role of the bottle, if this all is claimed to be sustainable, then everything along the process should be. 

What questions does it raise?
How is the bottle produced? Is that in a sustainable way? What material are being used? How and where is it being shipped? 

What things do you disagree with? 
I do not understand this question?

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
“Now the perfect temp is sustainable” - what if the perfect temp for be to drink my tea isn’t boiling hot as it probably is when I add it to the bottle, but cooled down a little? The wording is inaccurate in my opinion. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
The first image, just as I said, the bottle does not show anywhere and I do not get how it fits in. The second image I think is absolutely perfect. Love it! I would change the wording for the first one to: 
Sustainable temperature. 

I would change the working if the second one to:
Sustainable refreshment. 

I would change the image for the first one completely since I do not understand the connection to a bottle even. Why does this person need something to drink? Perhaps a more close-up on the person with the mountain like things in the background. 

The second image I would not change, there I totally buy the fact that she/he needs a drink after that hike looking out over the view. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
Travelling somewhere, going on a long drive, exploring the world by foot. The temperature is always the same. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
That you can think of anything else you might want to do and relax, because you will have the cold water hours and hours later. Bring your bottle anywhere. 

What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
You can be hours away from nearest watering but and still have beverage in your wished temperature. 

How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
The wording is very explicit and long. I would perhaps not read all of this just looking at the ad. More punchy wording needed. The word articulates the main idea, perhaps a little too clear. 

How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
So and so, and again, assuming I got the main idea, the imagery is conveying a feeling of travel and explore. I would perhaps update the image of the hiker girl to not stand on a boring grass in the shadow. 

Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
A little more “on the move” feeling to the hiker girl. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
The bottle is super much in focus. Perhaps it would be better if it was a little more subtle. The text is also super clear and a little long.  

What questions does it raise?
Is the hiker girl really thirsty while in the shadow there? Is the car girl DRIVING the car!? For how long of a hike or drive can you go, would 2 days also be fine with the same temp?

What things do you disagree with? 
I perhaps do not want to end the day as I started it. I would want to be left with a sense of “improvement” and wow-factor. With this concept everything seems so generic.  

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Finish as you started sounds a bit strange to me, and not inspiration. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Don’t drink and drive…. Update the image of the driving girl to not encourage that behaviour. Update the image for the hiker girl to loo like she needs some cold water. :) 

Change the wording to be more punchy. Bigger text, more spaces between the two lines. 
Also update the text because you want to get intrigued and inspired and not ""same as you started"" even if that in this case is somewhat of a good thing. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind? 
Sporty events, going out on a hike, you can choose when you want a drink and then it’ll be the same temp as you would expect. 

What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
This is how you drink from the bottle. :) I am guessing, I actually do not know. 

Main idea for the concept is intended?
I really don’t know how this concept differs from the just previous one with hiker girl and car girl. 

Wording articulate the main idea?
All day long for me indicates that “after a long work day” but the image tells a different story. Here, I am not sure if the intention is sporty hikes kind of events, perhaps the wording can be updated? 

Imagery convey the main idea?
The first image looks like a commercial for Patagonia since the vest is popping more in the image than the bottle does. Also, you see the Patagonia brand super clear but no brand for the bottle. The second image the bottle is held with the hand towards the camera, I would have her hold the bottle with the other hand so that you can actually see the product. There are also some strange sunlight dots that looks like they should not be there. 

What would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Show off the bottle more!!!!!!! And not do free advertisement for other brands. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
The bottle is not shown properly. 

What questions does it raise?
Is there a specific bottle for warm and cold beverages? Is the thermos like one only for coffee? 

What things do you disagree with? 
-

Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Already responded to this in the previous questions on this concept. 

What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Negative is that other brands show more than the bottle, and that the bottle is not portrayed in the second image. Wording - Make sure that the words represent what you are trying to convey, and that there is a minimum chance for misinterpretations (e.g. the coffee example). ""stays the way you take it"" change to ""stays the way it is"" is even better actually. 
Imagery - Make sure that other brands are not being shown off as much as they are right now. The vest is popping more in the image than the bottle and if I didn't know better I would say that this is an ad for another very famous brand instead.... Also, make sure the bottle is shown at all in the other image. Concept S for sure! My country Sweden is super into everything sustainable right now, so playing and using that would be the by far best option. Also, Swedes love to travel so the inspirational image for HOT would be super. 

I actually think that A would also not be all bad, the climate looks like the Scandinavian one so combining the ""types"" of images in A with the wording in S would be the best combo maybe?",Splash,

What is your initial reaction?
Cold: Seems fine
Hot: What is going on. Is he hot. Is he cold? He doesn't seem cold, he's hanging outside of a car with little clothes. So what's going on about his drink? It's supposed to stay warm? Why does he need a warm drink in a car when he's so hot that he has to hang outside of the window?

What... (<-word limit)
I like nature on the left. I don't like the way he's sitting outside of a window on what is actually the driver's side around where I live. Irritates me.

What....
Nothing, really. 

R)
What....
What is going on

What.....
Why ""pure""? Feels like it's supposed to say something about clarity/hygiene of my drink, as in it's not ""polluted"". I also don't really resonate with the sentence on having coffee ""the way I take it"". That's very broad, ""the way"" I take coffee to me is more about having it in a café made by somebody who know's what they are doing. I don't connect this to temperature. 

What....
Again, nothing really

S)
What is...
What?

What.....
I'm confused. The sentences sound so absurdly technical, I never talked about a drink as something ""sustainable"" before. My water or my coffee aren't in itself (as a liquid) sustainable to me. Maybe it's just a language barrier thing? But that doesn't sound appealing to me at all. And the photos confuse me as well, aren't they opposite to before? A
Cold: Die Temperatur bleibt gleich, egal wo du hin gehst
Hot: Beende den Tag mit der selben Temperatur, mit der du ihn begonnenhast

R
Cold: Reine Erfrischung, den ganzen Tag lang
Hot: Der Kaffee bleibt so, wie du ihn nimmst

S
Cold: Ab sofort bleibt die Temperatur nachhaltig
Hot: Erfrischung ist nachhaltig

I must be misunderstanding the english phrasing because this just sounds horrific in German, but it seems just as strange to me in english. I might not be familiar with this use of the word ""sustainable"" and therefore am not translating it very well. LEFT
What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
I'm stuck on the word ""sustainable"", it doesn't work for me at all in this context
What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
That my english isn't as good as I thought
What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
""Let's confuse se dschermans"" / on a more serious note: ""this bottle makes something possible you always wanted.""
How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
To me personally, not - at - all.
How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
She (he?) looks a bit uncomfortable honestly wandering around holding the bottle like that. I hate carrying stuff in my hands. I'd be annoyed if I was her that I have to carry it around. I'd rather have a picture of her just drinking, then I wouldn't be thinking about having to carry it.
Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Different wording, different picture

RIGHT (Word maximum reached, therefore shorter)
The picture is fine, looks great. The intention seems like the same as above. I still have the same issue with wording, so that's what I'd like to see changed. I feel like I answered these questions twice already O.O

It's much better than the other one. If I HAD to pick a negative, I'd say the fact that he (she?) is alone Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?

Changes to the wording?
Yes, to both! I'd prefer something like ""Refreshment is always at hand when you need it"" and ""Get your drink at the perfect temp. Anywhere. Anytime.""

Yes, to the left one mainly. It's too red. It's too grim. She looks very uncomfortable. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.

LEFT
Fun, nature, trip, hiking. The concept is easy going and about having a good time. The main idea seems to be: My drink will stay cool when I'm out and about. The wording is fine, I don't have any problems with it. I'm not enthusiastic about it either. I do like the picture a lot though. She seems to be having fun, she seems genuinely happy. To amplify the idea, I feel like there could be a friend in the photo as well. 

RIGHT
That's the same picture as before, I can't get over it. I don't understand if he/she is supposed to be hot or cold and what the drink is supposed to be. And I'm bothered by the fact that he/she is hanging outside a car window in the middle of the road. Maybe I'm too old. The wording is alright, doesn't ""spark"" much either though, just a fine description. Left:

I like this one a lot, there isn't anything I disagree with. The wording is fine as it is. The picture is good, too. I think I'd like it even more if there wasn't just one person. She could use some friends, even if just in the background waiting for her and waving at her to not take so much time with the selfie.

Right:

The more I write about this one the more I'm upset with the picture. I think I expressed my disagreement with it many times already.  My negative connotations are: Danger, confusion, unrealistic. The wording is fine though. Left:

I wouldn't change the wording. I'd give her some friends for the picture, they don't have to interact with her a lot or even look at the camera, they could be ahead a little in the hike and not even notice her taking the picture but at least she wouldn't look like someone lonely who is smiling to take an instagram picture and will then go back to being lonely :'-( I'm exaggerating a bit here, but hey, there's that word limit.

Right:

I'd swap the picture for any of the other ones out of any other concept. I stopped at the second stage of the other concept and wanted to continue there, but now I'm taken here. I'll try to find a place to continue the other one after completing this.

Left:

I like this one. The bottle looks slick and beautiful here. I'm not even sure if it was the same shape in the other concepts, but this one is nice. I feel like this one doesn't emphasize temperature as much as the others before, but it works for me actually. On the wording, I like ""refreshment"", it already sounds refreshing even saying it out loud. Fresh. Good one. I'm not too keen on ""pure"", but it's alright. All day long works, it's something I'd say as well, short and sweet, not too complicated. 

Right:

I feel like I wrote this before, but I don't like the wording and that makes my associations stay around it. I don't take my coffee out of a bottle, so no, it doesn't stay the way I take it, even out of a Hydro Flask. This one seems like it's trying to focus on the temperature more than the left one, but I get distracted by the wording. The imagery is ok, but it's a bit bland. She could be having anything there. It doesn't look like a situation where I'd want my coffee. Who even drinks coffee out in the woods? Left:

I'd say the only thing doesn't work so well for me here is the word ""pure"". What does it mean here? Unpolluted? Undisturbed? Unmodified? I can't tell if I disagree because I don't know what it's trying to say. The imagery is fine. I think I prefer to have a bit ""broader"" of a view on things though, I can't really locate her surroundings. I don't know what's going on. If I could chose: zoom out a little, get the background sharper

Right:

The wording doesn't work for me and the picture is just a bit bland. It just isn't true for me, because I take my coffee sitting down in a café in a cup and freshly made. I disagree with the statement and I start arguing with it in my mind. The picture is alright, but again, I'd zoom out a little to give me a sense of where I am. Left:

Wording: 
Your Refreshment 
all day long.

Picture:

Zoom out, sharp surroundings, give me orientation

Right:
Wording: 
Your coffee's temp stays where you like it

Picture:

Again. Zoom out, sharp surroundings, give me orientation. Also, if it has to stay centered around coffee I'd personally place it either in a city or at work. That's the non-café places where I drink coffee. Funny, quite a few of the wordings are irritating to me. I'd just take COLD A + COLD R because those 2 are the only ones where neither the wording or the picture irritate me.",Splash,
296573,Javier,Barriopedro,jbarriopedro@hotmail.com,"I like concepts A the best as theses are a bit less ""pretentious"" regarding the main appeal of the flask, and the photos are dynamic and out-of-the ordinary, as opposed to the other two sets. Finally, I felt the sustainable angles ends up reading a bit forced as it is really simplistic—it's just using the word and not much else in terms of ecological balance or pro-environment messages. Concepts A:
Frío
A la misma temperatura, no importa dónde vayas.
Caliente
Termina el día a la temperatura con lo que comenzaste.

Here I used minor changes in words to keep true to the original context yet still reading like an original Spanish (Mexican, mostly) sentence.

Concepts R:
Frío
Total frescura, todo el día.
Caliente
El café sigue como lo tomas.

No major changes to either grammar o contexts, although these aren't ""direct"" word-for-word translations. 

Concepts S:
Frío
Ahora, la temperatura perfecta es sustentable.
Caliente
La frescura es sustentable.
No major changes and direct translation into Spanish... and this sounds less ""empty"" now that I read them in Spanish. First, it reads like something linked to environmental issues, but it then falls flat as it's only a ""trendy word"" dropped just to sound ""cool"", but devoid of any real context.

The idea of ""less waste"" is not even clearly presented or hinted at, even; therefore, the ""sustainable"" adjective is nothing but an empty word and audiences and consumers are smarter than that. So, even if ""implied""... the execution just feels like it was done to remain ""current"" yet no commitment is ever made.

Then, the wording... no. Agains. is sounds ""trendy"", but as with most ""trendy things"" it's just empty banter using buzzwords, but not much else.
The imagery is nice, but it doesn't immediately relate to the concepts presented.

I really believe that the concept of sustainability is not one that can be reduced to a single image without going beyond a mere phrase to accompany it. The word ""sustainable"". It has a more ample meaning and more pressing need to make it obvious how any given product actively works to help in improving a sustainable future. The word ""sustainable"" is just out of place here,

The question it raises is: ""is this really talking about producing less waste? How will the flask be packed? How will it it commit to the cause beyond being ""sustainable""?

The images are good, but the product isn't that easy to spot in them. While there are no negative connotations, well... it really ins't that diverse in terms of skin color or real locations around the world. That might help to make it a product that is interesting and good for everyone on the planet, and not only for the privileged who can afford to go hiking abroad. Maybe if the wording went: ""The perfect temperature for everyone in the world. We'll make it possible,"" it might address the issue of both a perfect drink and global warming. Then again, I don't think my idea is that much better, as it uses the concept without enough context to make it evident and a sort of commitment to ecological consciousness and sustainable development. This one is also very cool... it's ""fresh"" and uplifting. The message here is ""everything is going to be all right. You got this, we¡ll help you,"" and that's a good thing because it makes me feel like the brand both empowers and accompanies the consumer during every task and hour of the day. This one also works very well and I would only add more ""inclusive"" imagery (many variations for the same two phrases) so everyone in the world can connect with brand and feel a connection to it and the flask. In a way, seeing people from all walks of life using/enjoying the flask will make it easier for anyone to develop an emotional response to it, Once again, I would not change a single thing in terms of wording. Perhaps the second one sounds a bit ""off,"" but then again I am not a native speaker so  I might be missing some nuance or colloquial use of the phrase sans the pronoun (it) at the end. Finally, to reiterate: many different peoples equals more representation and a stronger connection with everyone out there in the world who need a flask to keep their drinks at the temperature they like it. This one is my favorite so far. It really says that you will have your drink just the way you want it at the right temperature for you and everywhere you need to/feel like.
It implies control over your resources and the ability to go about your daily life, free of worries (regarding your drink).
The main idea is ""the ideal temperature for you.""
Everything, wording and imagery, work very well for this concept.
If anything can amplify the idea, it would be to have many more images of different peoples and cultures, all enjoying their drink of choice at the temperature they prefer to have it. I don't see any weaknesses in this concept. It is inclusive, it clearly shows the product and the wording relates to the images presented; it can't be any more clear or descriptive. I like it because it's simple, direct and easy to relate to. It speaks/shows past satisfactory experiences and people can see themselves in said situations. Again, this one is my favorite concept and the wording is simple, precise; it leaves no room for confusion or alienates the observer in any way. My only idea to make it even better is to present it with many more  versions of people around the planet, engaged in a wide variety of activities, eyat all having their drink just how they like it. I would be a bit torn between concepts A and R, but in the case of Mexico, I would definitely go for R, as it is the one that delivers a promise of control/quality over you beverage of choice.",Splash,

I like the copy for this ‘cold’ ad the most out of all of these. It would benefit from being separated by a full stop after 'stays' to add some immediacy. 

The temperature stays. 
Wherever you go. 

My feeling is that—in general—the temperature USP isn't quite clear enough. I think more could be done to make that standout. I think there should be some extra, simple copy under the flask. Something along the lines of 'The flask that keeps your drinks hot or cold'. 

The image is so naff. These photos read VERY American. I think that's ok for ‘hot as it's focused around roadtrip/adventure but the ‘cold’ ad is not right for a UK market. I would combine the ‘cold’ copy and ‘hot’ image. 

R
I would prefer to see the ‘cold’ copy separated by full stops. The image is ok but a bit like a Cotwsolds Outdoor Clothing ad. I’m not getting a hip vibe from this ad. I understand that it’s trying to play on the “how do you take your coffee” saying but it’s not working for me. Is there something in “hot to the last drop”?

S
Wow, these images are great but the ‘cold’ ad doesn't feature the bottle enough for me. I think the ‘hot’ image pops because of the matching blue tones but it's totally lost in the other. “Refreshment is sustainable” isn’t speaking to me. It’s also too long for one line. Ran out of words in the last one so here's that bit: 

WHAT I’D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT: 
-	What would a day look like with my bottle? 
-	I would love to see some movement and video!
-	Can you use one cup for both hot and cold? Or are they different?
-	What is the thinking behind the logo? 
-	Is this targeted for travel or lifestyle/everyday? The colour, photography and logo are giving me a very strong traveller impression and I’d like to see a more work/urban orientated imagining. 1.	Travel. Adventure. America. Australia. Eco-lover. Globetrotter. 
2.	 Let’s take care of this planet! 
3.	Keeping a reusable flask is sustainable and great for the environment. 
4.	It’s not sparking to me, sorry. 
5.	I don’t like the left image. I can’t see the bottle at all and the travel image isn’t the most inspiring to me now that I look at it longer. I love the image on the right and think the sea really brings out the blue in the bottle. 
6.	Sharper copy to help communicate the concept and a different image for the left. 1.	Left = the image and copy. Right = the copy. 
2.	What is the temp? What do you mean? Why is it sustainable? 
3.	The choice of image 
4.	“the perfect temp is sustainable” isn’t working for me. 
5.	No negative connotations but the left isn’t as strong as the right. From the right image I am getting a strong ‘backpacker and gap year student’ vibe—
Especially from the hat. Don’t know if that’s intentional? Alternate copy: 

Keep your water as cool as the view. 
Look after the world, while you admire it. 
Look after your world, while you travel it. 

Maybe a photo with orange canyons similar to the left photo with someone climbing it/hanging off in a daring and adventorous way and the copy: 

Keep your water cool. 
No sweat. 1.	USA. USA. 
2.	That this is an American travel equipment brand. 
3.	The temperature of this flask stays the same all day. 
4.	It is clear but could be sharper. 
5.	Well but not quite relevant for a UK market IMO. 
6.	Separating the copy in two sentences and using a different image for the left ad. 1.	The choice of model / outfit on the left. 
2.	Why does my water need to be cold if its snowing?
3.	The copy being one sentence. 
4.	I would like to know if the other participants feel just “the temperature” is clear enough. I’m undecided. 
5.	As I’ve said the images are very USA to me. I think that’s fine where it is depicting a sense of road trip, adventure and travel but for the left, it just isn’t quite the right cultural fit for a UK customer who would buy this product. Copy for the first ad: 

The temperature stays. 
Wherever you go. 

Copy for the 2nd ad: 
Finish the day. 
With the temp you started. 

I'd change the image for the cold ad. 

If a female lifestyle image is what you'd like then maybe two women going to a london yoga studio would be better? 1.	Cotwsolds Outdoor Clothing. Not cool. The one to the right is the most ‘urban’ or ‘lifestyle’ iteration which I’m drawn to as an office worker. 
2.	The blue really pops and the whole ad is very ‘adventurer’ to me. Eco-lover. 
3.	Keep it cool. Or Keep it hot. 
4.	Cold = great. I like this copy but would prefer it to be two sentences, not one. Hot = this isn’t working for me. In particular the “take it”. I get the thinking but it doesn’t flow. It’s not connecting to ‘hot’ naturally enough. 
5.	That big product shot works well with the photographs but I’m not sold on these two photos of the models being the strongest possible. 
6.	I’d like a shorter copy point under the flask to explain the product a little and leave the copy at the top to be fun and snappy without needing as much explanation. 1.	Slightly the copy? 
2.	I’m not getting any idea of the temperature brand USP here. 
3.	The cold copy being one sentence. 
4.	The “take it” isn’t working for me, sorry. 
5.	I find it interesting that the bottle is being drank in both. I feel like I usually see them on a desk, or with them being held with a smile. Also, for the hot one. Can you drink coffee like that if its hot? Isn’t it more a sip? I would change the copy to: 

Pure refreshment. 
All day long. 

Your morning coffee. 
Hot to the last drop. 

And for the images, I would like to see her on the go, with a bag and her flask or laughing with friends and showing that this is something she takes everywhere so we can see how its fitting in with her life. I would use: 

The temperature stays.
Wherever you go. 

With the hot photo from Concept S or A. 

or... 

Your morning coffee. 
Hot till the last drop. 

With the more urban / lifestyle shot in Concept R or something with a more london feel to it.",Splash,
296574,Michelle,Aboumrad,m.eliane.ab@gmail.com,"Concept A
> At first I thought the snow image was talking about cold drinks, but it makes total sense it's the other way around.
> I don't quite like the ""slogans"" I think they are too long and aren't catchy enough. I like the second image more, the composition works better for advertisement than the first one because her arm is cut in a her joint. I don't think it makes much sense when put together.
> I would like to know if there are two different bottles because each one works for a different temperature or just because there are different designs.

Concept R
> I feel the freshness of her expression and related to the advertisement. But if you do not read the text, the images could be easily confused. It's not too clear which one is hot/cold
> I like the congruency of both images. Slogans are shorter and better. Liked them more than last ones.
> I would like to know how the bottle works for keeping the temperature the way it is meant to be 

Concept S
> Love the pictures. They make me feel like grabbing my bag and traveling now! Do not quite like the second phrase, it makes no connection for me
> I love the landscapes and that it includes 'sustainable' on the text. I do not like the way they are related to the temperatures. You want a hot drink when it's cold outside...
> How it is 'sustainable' 1) La temperatura permanece, no importa a donde vayas - it is translated more as an interpretation than a literal way. Still it keeps a lot of the original text. I tryed to play with the concepts of staying/going 
2) Termina el día con la temperatura con que empezaste - It's a literal translation and in Spanish it would sound really weird... actually I do not like this slogan in Englis either...
3) Refrescante todo el día - Took out the word 'pure' because when translated would sound weird 
4) Tu café a la temperatura que lo tomas - I put it like talking to a person in particular and not to many people, because everyone haves their coffee in a different temperature so I think this might make it more relatable 
5) Ahora la temperatura perfecta es sustentable - Literal translation. Works good in Eng & Spa
6) La frescura es sustentable -  I have found it hard to translate 'refreshment' in a way it works... but this translation is almost literal I associate it to outdoors people, people that like adventure and traveling. People that have what they need in their backpack and every thing would be very well thought to be light to carry around, useful and durable. 
It also implies this people apart from being travel lovers, are thoughtful about the environment 
- Outdoors, adventure and sustainability -
They work together to impact a target that purchase or acquire things to be long lasting and sustainable
I think both the wording and imagery works together very good, but they do not necessarily say anything about temperature. This is definitely not the purpose You can barely see how they use the flask. It is hard to find the product in the picture
It makes me ask myself about durability, but this is good because it makes me think that the flask is hard and resistant 
I do no like the use of the word 'temp' I think 'Now the perfect drink is sustainable' could work better
They are both great images, but I would like to see the expressions of their face in the first one. Since I am not spotting the flask at first view, it could easily be a generic image and not one make particularly for the brand. So beyond an experience related to the product, it tells more about a lifestyle that could but does not necessarily relates to the flask. I would change the word temp. You could either use 'drink' or 'temperature'
I do not think the whole campaign uses a lot of slangs or short words, so this pops up
I would also like to see them using the flask and not only carrying them, and looking at their expressions while using it.
The objective is for people to USE it, not only purchase and carrying it around Freedom, outdoors, fun, youth, fresh, beauty, nature, travel.
It implies you could take the flask everywhere and it is not heavy or takes too much space / uncomfortable to carry. It also implies durability and functionality. 
Main idea has everything to do with temperature. It's in the wording and above all the concepts, in this one you could really tell the difference of temperatures between them. So weather you need cold water after hiking in the woods in a sunny day or keeping hot coco while driving across a cold mountain, the flask will work in any situation.
In the first image, wording could talk about cold or hot drink, but the image helps it fall in place for she has a no sleeve shirt and it is a sunny day. In the second one, after reading it you understand you wake up warm so they are talking about a warm drink.
Imagery works really good, since you could see the difference between them. A sunny day, she is wearing a cap and sporty clothes. Mountains and snow, she is wearing a sweater, so it makes you feel cold.
Overall I like this concept, I am not too convinced by the second wording, I think it is weird to relate a hot drink with how warm/hot you feel when you wake up This is for me the concept that works better
I only disagree with the phrase 'the temperature you started' I think there might be another way to refer to a hot temperature rather than your warm bed
About the imagery I would only change the first picture for one taken to her and not a selfie. I think this is more casual and the other picture is not as casual. Or the other way around, make the other picture a selfie... I would change ' finish the day with the temperature you started' the more I read it, the more I dislike it. The picture does not reflect she is finishing her day and she does not necessarily stared it being warm. I would change this whole wording to make it more accurate to the image because the image has more punch and is stronger.
And as I have already said, I would make the first picture a taken one and not a slefie She is an outdoor person looking to be hydrated everywhere // She is a city girl working and moving since early hours around her city and prefers having her own flask
Implies activity, responsibility and commitment with the environment. She knows her routine so she is prepared to accomplish it and be ready in every situation.
Enjoying refreshment how and where you want it.
It works very well for the idea of refreshment, but maybe not to good for cold temperature as good as it works for hot one.
I think the cold one does not necessarily shows or transmits the feeling. Hot one only works when you read it is coffee they are talking about
I would like the images to be more explicit about the situation she is in. Her expression seems the same in both pictures Her expression is almost the same in both images. They only difference is the background and it is not such a big item in the picture, so each picture could easily work for the other text, and it is not what you need when planning a campaign. Though images should have congruence, they should be easily identified to the concept, but in this case, she could be doing anything and you could not tell the difference wether she needs a hot or a cold drink.
Wording is ok, it could work if the pictures would be clearer about the temperature, specially for the cold one For the cold drink I would like to see her in a more active way or in a way you could tell she needs refreshment. In this picture she could just be hanging by a bridge and she might as well have a sip of her drink, but do not necessarily needs it. Maybe if the picture would be more open, if you could see what she is doing and where. Like, if she was running and she stops to refresh, you need to see her tennis... you know?
For the second one, yes she could be drinking coffee, but it could also be clearer. Also background could help in this situation, you could show it is early in the morning and she wants some coffee before her daily activities Concept S 
I feel more related to that one and I like to purchase things that are sustainable and long lasting. Usable for traveling and easy to carry around.
I also like relation between wording and images the most and it reflect what I want to do and who I want to be.",Splash,
296575,David,von Blohn,david@ontheroad.media,"CONCEPTS A
1. Like it! 
2. Maybe the selfie picture is a bit ""too much"" for me. I like images with a more calm language. I like the text, but it's a bit abstract, as it talks about concepts and categories instead of practical examples. 
3. I'd like to get to know the two people using the product to understand how they the use it and what value it provides to them. Maybe a influencer concept  like ""find out why (name) takes our bottle to her road trip to Alaska."" 

CONCEPTS R
1. Mixed. 
2. Like the imagery! The first text sounds cliché, the second one is great as it illustrates an example of the advantage of using the bottles. 
3. Again, it like to see the character using the bottle in a short video where we see her during her day-to-day routine. 

CONCEPTS S
1. Don't like it so much. 
2. The text reads strange. The word sustainable doesn't really ecco within me in the context of  a bottle. 
3. I think if we use the word ""sustainable"", then we'd have to embrace the concept more, for example somebody doing working on a farm or doing environmental work in some remote forest. That way we understand how the aim for a more sustainable way of living connects with the product. CONCEPTS A
Die Temperatur bleibt, egal wohin du gehst. 
Beende den Tag mit der Temperatur mit der du ihn angefangen hast. 

CONCEPTS R
Pure Erfrischung, den ganzen Tag lang. 
Kaffee bleibt so wie du ihn mitnimmst. 

CONCEPTS S
Die perfekte Temperatur ist jetzt nachhaltig. 
Erfrischung ist nachhaltig. 1. As I explained in the previous task, the word sustainable creates some noise in my head as it associate with a broader view of the way we as humans coexist with the environment. I like the imagery, the two dominant colors red-brown and blue for well with the branding of the bottle. 
2. I think it tries to create a connection with environmental consciousness. As I said, I think if that's the goal, we should make it more implicit, for example through images of somebody working on a farm, doing environmental work in a forest, etc. That would also be a way to distance ourselves from the ""typical hipster travel imagery"" and create a deeper purpose. 
3. I think the main idea of this concept is to connect with environmental conscious customers.  
4. It does, but in a passive and product-focused way. I think we should rather focus on the target customer and talk about their experience and goal. 
5. See above, make it more implicit by creating a direct connection with the concept of sustainability. 
6. What I just mentioned. (If that was the intended idea, of course! ;)) 1. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
I feel like I already answered this question. I think the word sustainable isn't clear and if the intention is to use it as the anchor here, we should make more explicit what it means. 
2. What questions does it raise?
How does this bottle contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle? 
3. What things do you disagree with? 
It's not clear, how the bottle contributes to sustainability. Is it because we can reuse it? Because of the production process? Because its super durable? Because it is so good, that it serves all purposes and we therefore don't need another bottle? 
4. Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
The word now doesn't have a clear meaning in the first sentence. Obviously it relates to the fact that this product is somehow new, but then why wouldn't we use it in the second text? 
5. What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
First image: the person should look at the camera and be more expressive. Second image: Like it, could be Ireland. 1. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
Make the connection with sustainability more explicit. Beyond the imagery which implies that the two characters like and appreciate nature, why is what they do sustainable and why does the bottle contribute to that? I mentioned examples to create that connection in the previous responses. 
2. What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
a. Changes to the wording?
The word now. I'd add it to both copies. 
b. Changes to the imagery?
See above. 1. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
Here the key message that we try to convince the customers with is clear: this bottle keeps your drinks cold/ warm. 
2. What does it imply that is not said explicitly? 
Little. I think it's a very explicit and clear message. 
3. What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
This bottle keeps your drinks cold/ warm. 
4. How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
Perfectly, I like the copy. 
5. How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
It does. As the second copy talks about finishing the day, I think we could use an image where the bully drives into sunset to represent the element of time in the images. The first concept is not about time but about places, so it works great, with the wide mountain space behind her. 
6. Thinking about all all your answers above, what would you like to see amplified to enhance the main idea? Why?
Just the element of time in the second image. 1. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
I think it works well! 
2. What questions does it raise?
None, it explains clearly what the product is about. 
3. What things do you disagree with? 
Both girls are white, could we be a bit more diverse? 
4. Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Nope. 
5. What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
To create a deeper connection with our audience, the girl in the first image shouldn't wear sunglasses so the audience can make eye contact with her. 1. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
No sunglasses and maybe a bit more diversity in the characters. 
2. What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
a. Changes to the wording?
It's great! 
b. Changes to the imagery?
What I mentioned: No sunglasses and an image that includes the element of time. (A grey sky doesn't as we don't understand the time of the day.) 1. What are all the thoughts and associations this concept brings to mind?  That may have been intended or not.
Like the backlit imagery, especially the casual shot from the side of the second image which is an interesting angle beyond typical advertising images. Love the second copy, the first isn't totally clear to me. 
2. What does it imply that is not said explicitly?
I think it's pretty clear and doesn't imply much more than what is said. Maybe the fact that the bottle is great for outdoors/ sports and also for an urban activity (second picture). 
3. What do you believe the main idea for the concept is intended to be? Describe it in a single sentence. 
Here we have one character in the environments, so the concept might be how the bottle is useful for your life in general, not just a single activity or space. 
4. How well does the wording articulate the main idea?
I think the first copy isn't totally clear as we don't know why the bottle guarantees pure refreshment all day long. Is it because of its volume that allows us to carry around what we need for the whole day? (Of course, that's not the point.) 
5. How well does the imagery convey the main idea?
I like the imagery, I think the character should have her eyes open in the first picture. 
6. The first copy could be clearer. 1. What doesn’t work so well for you with this concept? 
I think the first copy is the main issue. 
2. What questions does it raise?
Why pure refreshment all day long? 
3. What things do you disagree with? 
None. 
4. Is there anything in the wording that doesn’t sound right?
Pure seems a bit exaggerated. 
5. What about the imagery - is it as good as it could be? Does it have any negative connotations?
Nope, works well. I'd just like to see the characters eyes open in one of the images. 1. Thinking about the challenges you just identified, take each one in turn ... how would you resolve them?
Have the character open her eyes on the first image. And change the first copy to create another specific example like in the second copy which I like a lot. 
2. What other alterations or additions would make this concept a great one?
a. Changes to the wording?
See above. 
b. Changes to the imagery?
See above. Concept A, because it's clear regarding the value the bottle adds to the customers life. In Mexico, Coca-Cola dominates the market with its non-reusable cans and bottles and while society is growing more conscious for the need to use reusable bottles, there's still a long way to go.",Splash,
295460,Ciaran,Thapar,cthapar27@gmail.com,"I suppose in some way bizarrely, but still undeniably, it's got to be a split between my bedside lamp and my engraved pen. I think they go together for this question because I am a massive fan of comfortable, homely aesthetics - qualities and subtleties in a room which make you relax and feel at ease - and I am a writer who has quite an intense addiction to getting my thoughts on a page. It is the mid-winter currently, and when I get back to my flat in the late afternoon after being out for the day cycling or walking in the cold, when it goes dark relatively early, I switch on my bedside lamp which sets the tone of a quiet sanctuary in my flat and my bedroom. The lamp isn't a normal one; it is a 70-year-old French antique reading lamp, with a soft clicker and an adjustable shade, an it frankly just makes my bedroom look calm and professional. My ball-point pen is engraved with my initials and it was a present from my girlfriend. I take it everywhere with me and discover a lot of important ideas with it, many of which pay for my life through my journalism and give me a huge amount of fulfilment. I am writing a book and use it to take notes for that. Lamp and pen. Peaceful, neat, reflective, calm, homely. a) I first heard about my Urban Ears Plattan ADV because my Dad bought a pair. He kept talking about how I should buy a pair, and then when I would visit his house every few weeks, often to sit and write at my desk, I would borrow his headphones to zone out and focus. I enjoyed using them because they are subtle and comfortable. I gained my music-listening obsession and commitment to concentrating on my work from my Dad, so I feel like the headphones probably gave me another important avenue to access more of that relationship: one in which I trusted him. I soon got given a pair of my own for Christmas from my Dad.
b) I didn't buy them but it was obvious I needed new headphones, which is why my Dad bought them for me. I had very cheap, bulky, wired Sony headphones before which I was attached to but not particularly impressed with. I had expressed wanting wireless headphones which would give me more flexibility and less complication whilst enjoying my private music listening experiences. It was a decision made by recognising I needed to invest in a higher quality pair but also be wary of not spending too much money as I have a tendency to break/misplace items!
c) Wireless, subtle, sleek, portable (i.e. not too bulky), bendable/foldable, noise-cancelling, less than £50.
d) Quite a big one. In 2018 I have started to write quite regularly about music, including writing paid reviews of albums and EPs, so I have come to appreciate the art of really listening deeply to music even more than before. Price before was important because I don't trust myself with a really expensive pair, but I also am not earning enough - and don't tend to ask my parents for much for Christmas - to justify getting a very expensive pair. I think going forward I will pay more for better noise cancelling, a better sound palette, and really importantly, comfort for long-haul listening (i.e. where you can listen to them for 2 hours plus without your ears throbbing from their grip).
e) Trusted my experience using my Dad's! But next time I invest in a pair of headphones, which I will almost definitely do in 2019 sometime, I will ask my friends who produce music, as well as sample more pairs in shops to get into the detail of what I want.
f) Last December (2017) - they were £35, half price from £70. I believe my Dad bought them from Amazon.
g) Familiarity, they look cool, quite small but still sturdy. Over-ear vs. on-ear headphones
Depends. Over-ear - not that I have a pair - for when you are at home or sat still without having to carry them around I feel like they are more effective at noise-cancelling and are ideal for static listening. On ear looks cooler and appear more portable, intuitively, so I feel like my on-ear ones right now for example suit my lifestyle of being on the move around London often.

Wireless vs. wired headphones
Wireless are awesome. Wireless all day. Wires are old news, they get in the way, tug around in your bag. There is not one advantage to them apart from not needing to charge them but that is a negligible price to pay if you get wireless headphones with a decent battery.

Wireless earphones vs. true wireless buds 
Never used either of them. But wireless buds look very cool and I have friends who recommend getting some for exercise/swimming.

What brand and model do you think wins in each of these sub-categories?

If I am to be completely honest, I simply do not know enough to do justice to this question. I won't waste your time or warp your research with ill-informed answers. a) Premium means a cut above the rest. I will expect to get something better than a standard quality product or service. I will therefore be happy to spend more money on that product or service. And if it doesn't deliver in way that is reflective of a heightened quality then it will really annoy me! The best example I can give is spending a lot of money on food. If I spend a lot of money on a dish on grounds that it has been sold as premium, and it turns out that I can cook it better, or I know a place that can make a more authentic/better tasting dish, then I tend to get very frustrated. The word premium raises expectations, which means the product or service has to meet those expectations.

b) i) Pairs of jeans, and shirts. Every year I will always now invest in an expensive pair of jeans, often from Levis, more than I used to. I used to spend £20 on pairs of jeans but soon realised that the quality and shape of them often won't hold for very long. So I am more prepared to invest money in a premium pair of jeans which are obviously going to last me longer and justify a greater expenditure. The exact same is true for shirts. I have shirts I bought for £50+ from many years ago which still feel and look good. The shirts I buy for cheap won't hold quality for long. Premium clothing, food, drink...these are fundamentals to a good life because they are part of our everyday experience. Money isn't always the determinant, but will often accompany a premium label. It needs to be justified.

c) By society standards, there is a 'premium' Indian restaurant near me in Oval, south London. It is expensive, plush inside, and branded as top quality food. But for me this is simply not premium Indian food: it is premium Indian food which has been diluted by a more monied Western demand, i.e. one demanding less spice and intensity of flavour. The same is true for all types of food, no doubt, and I apply this lens elsewhere (i.e. I try to trust informed friends rather than branding or internet reviews), but Indian food is particularly close to my heart. I would rather travel an hour across London and pay half the price for a much better meal, with premium flavour(!), than walk to the end of my road to an illegitimately self-branded 'premium' restaurant. It's not premium because although you might pay for what is considered better food in some people's eyes, it's not authenticity or universality (i.e. respected by all people) that is being paid for. The same applies for other products: to be premium I think it has to be indisputably a cut above the rest, appreciated by all. My espresso machine. It's just something I value as being on a higher mechanical / luxurious level than anything else in my flat. My coffees 2/3 times a day, when I often work from home whilst writing, give me structure and the boost I need. I've become attached to having proper expressos and grinding the beans every week. The machine makes the open kitchen and living room of my flat look aesthetically premium. It makes me feel comfortable, secure, and like I'm doing things properly. I think it demonstrates that I am someone who likes rituals that give me structure and small bursts of pleasure during my day. a) Bowers and Wilkins. Sennheiser. They look like they own the headphone space. They are both brands which seem to enter conversation and pop culture a lot in my life as trusted high quality headphone makers even though I've never owned or consciously looked for a pair of either.

b) I don't know much about models but the top-of-the-range over-ear models, which have insane sound cancelling, for me make headphones premium over any other factor. If your headphones can create a little world for you to experience they are doing their job properly: the better they do this, the more premium they are. (And I associate both brands above as looking good, too.)

c) Wireless is a must now, surely? I can't imagine having wired headphones now I've had wireless ones this year. Noise cancelling (see above). Comfort: if you can wear them whilst zoning in on work / writing all afternoon and they don't strain your ears, and you basically forget they are there, for me that'd be pretty impressive and ideal. a) Discovered a long-read profile about Tupac written in 1997, shortly after his death, in The New Yorker magazine.
b) Surfing Twitter.
c) Because I am a huge Tupac fan, and have been since I was 11, and New Yorker long-reads are my favourite form of journalism on the planet. So it was this synergy of my favourite cultural interests. I sent it to so many people before I'd even finished it; I had to share my excitement. The way it was written so long ago and so captured the time shortly after he was murdered, but also still made complete perfect sense 20 years later, and didn't read as out-of-date despite how the world has changed since then. Crazy.
d) Enjoy: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/07/07/the-takedown-of-tupac a) Social politics in Britain, race, racial identity and racism, London rap music, how my male friends treat, or are treated by, or ought to treat, women they have dated/are dating/are in a relationship with, media discourse and representation.
b) A lot to do with social media and the ideas-sharing which now takes place everywhere, it means debate naturally happens around identity politics a lot. My friendship group are very mixed racially; I am mixed race. I am a youth worker and see what political choices made by people in power are doing to vulnerably young people in London. I am in my mid-late twenties and relationships are a big deal to people my age, especially some of my baffled friends who need constant advice or challenge on their ideas.
c) Where do I start? More compassion, more connection between people, less ego, more incentives to do things that aren't driven by money, more conversation between people in person rather than over social media or instant messaging. If you are going to write journalism or represent anyone or anything do it from personal experience or at least channeling the thorough experience of someone else, rather than just putting yourself at the centre of the stage or guessing at truth. These are the underpinnings of my views on the current state of the world, but in particular London. I hope that made sense!
d) Social media. But I tend to read about a few topics and read about them thoroughly in books and long-form journalism, rather than try and read lots of little bits of information, like platforms tempt you to do. I enjoy learning about things in depth and with nuance, otherwise I see it as pointless and unfulfilling.
e) I think all root problems and solutions come from education. So I'd make a global education system which allows for equal ideas-sharing across borders, which harnesses the power of the internet properly, and proper incentives for teachers, and focuses on problem solving on humanity's inequalities and injustices rather than obsessing over money and narcissism. 1. Nike - has managed to transcend their prime function as a sportswear brand and become socially significant as a signal of general relevance and modernism, youth culture, hiphop fashion, etc. Managed to do this for multiple decades all round the world. They've got it right for many reasons but I think the way they have recognised the need to invest in specialist departments and teams who understand frontline subcultures. They both capture and set trends like no other.

Sennheiser - I can't even tell you why but I have always associated them with owning the top spot of headphones. That says something about far-reaching their name is in terms of being trusted, respected, present as the go-to premium brand.

I also really liked this Bose advert! It connected with how I view and use my headphones. https://www.tvadvertmusic.com/2018/10/video-bose-noise-song/


2. MSF in the Netherlands. Their recent 'Ebola selfie' campaign where they asked influencers to post selfies with 'ebola' makeup was tone deaf and offensive. Random example I realise, but I study media/comms narratives about social issues a lot and I think getting them right is difficult, but getting them wrong is a big ethical catastrophe. 

Beats: obviously they are nailing it so I can't be too critical. But this is purely personal honesty: I cannot imagine myself ever buying them purely because of how obvious they have become. Too omnipresent, too much like a uniform for modern life, too gimmicky. I like being my own person and not being hounded by brands and I often quote Beats as an example of this mistake.

3. I wrote this so it's a bit biased but it was genuinely a cool thing to be a part of: https://air.jordan.com/card/the-artist-who-goes-by-23/

Having a brand ambassador who literally called himself after their product, but also can talk with nuance and detail about them in an appreciation going back over fifteen years, is something I think really aligns with the way Jordans hold weight in London and in inner-city youth culture. He embodies the urban British young person's fascination with Jordans. It'd a smart move and not contrived - he was ecstatic to be given the opportunity to rep them!

Beats: Again, I would never buy them, and do but because it's the only partnership I've seen recently - and it's one I think has been generally successful - is Anthony Joshua. He is admired by everyone and his personality/solo athletic profession suits having headphones which help him get into his zone.

4. GQ x Jonny Depp: https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/johnny-depp-interview-2018

This piece was weird. So much time and detail put into a character who doesn't need it and perhaps doesn't deserve such uncritical, awe-filled attention. Brand over ethics. It nearly prevented me pitching to the magazine to write for them, which proves how even singular partnerships or projects can hold a lot of weight in people's minds. I'd make it my mission to let people sample those headphones and see just how powerful they can be to enhance your experience of life. Until I'd properly tried noise cancelling headphones I didn't realise how great they can be and wouldn't have thought to invest in them. Now I can't wait to afford a proper pair.",Sonic,
295461,Ben ,Isley,ben_isley@hotmail.com,"The item I am most proud of is definitely my record player, I physically miss it if i spend a couple of weeks away from it. I have always been noted by my parents to take care of my things.. I have a passion for music and have built a relatively small, but refined collection of tracks and albums that I have a magnetism to. Whether its the moment in which I heard it or general nostalgia (what i was brought up listening to)

I take care of it - It's a 1987 Rega Planar 2, that myself and my father dug out as a birthday present about 6 years ago. I loved getting it, but admittedly knew very little about records before i got it. I still feel as though I know almost nothing as the analogue music world is a deep and knowledge filled one. With parametres of wave forms, tone arm stiffness, reverb measurements and countless other tiny details with an eye to achieve the nicest sound quality.. I don't really take part in this 'geekathon' quite yet - but, like gold.. see it as something I cvan get my teeth into if i'm bored in later life. Ive recently started buying records with an eye to start vinyl DJing, not out - just to myself (for now) How/Where did you first hear about them? What was it that caught your attention and interest?
I saw them online on the WHAT HI-FI best of 2018. I always look on here first before thinking about buying. I liked the review as it said they focus on design and quality, remaining light and simple. None of these little 'stay in your ear-gizmos' that some have now.

Why did you decide to buy a new pair of headphones?
I had a pair that i have sweated profusely in - in the gym, beaches, running, snowboarding... I wanted a slender and sleak pair for everyday use that hadnt been through the rough & tumble of sweaty activities.

What were your considerations when deciding what headphones to buy?
Design - Look - Sound Quality vs Size

How much was price a consideration? What features would you be willing to pay more for?  
I was willing to pay up to a maximum of 60£ (as they were a second pair) anymore than that and you're getting into ok on ear realm. I think always materials and 'feel' are important. I despise the cheaper headphones on the market (some aren't even cheaper) that are plastic a little too light. I would always pay slightly more for something that i'm less likely to lose - i loose things i don't care about or see as some level of an investment. I spend slightly more on sunglasses and headphones - so I take more care of them.

Where did you look for/get information to help you make the decision?
Viewing people on trains and the underground - looking at some on them and seeing what i DIDN'T WANT! Then always WHAT HI-FI yearly top picks section.

Where and when did you buy these? How much did you pay?
I got them on amazon - as I have prime and wanted them quick. Ive since cancelled prime so would simply get from the cheapest place - with decent and fair delivery costs. Likely to still be amazon.. I payed 35.00 GBP

What ultimately sold you on these headphones?
The sleak design - lightweight & finally a friend saying he has them and likes them. Has had no issues with them breaking etc. Over-ear vs. on-ear headphones
- On ear works best for me. The size is often more manageable and keeps them slimline and portable (if need be). I actually chuckle to myself how some people on the train havce these massive things - they're almost the size of a baby dropped over your head. Beats crack me up too - the fact you need batteries for many of them - WEIGHT TO GO!

Wireless vs. wired headphones
- Wireless is the dream, but i still haven't ever invested in any. They're often a heightened price and i have imagined too many times the batteries running out or some connection issues. Maybe i have become super impatient but i hate pairing things with Bluetooth.. it seems long and if i had to do that even twice a week or whatever it would annoy me i feel. All of my on ear headphones I have owned have had wires - Also, I still find people walking around with wireless headphones on a little... weird! Im sure i will change my outlook on them soon but for me .... wire all the way (for now at least)

Wireless earphones vs. true wireless buds
I would lose wireless buds. Fact. I would only really buy wireless earphones (on ear) as a taster of the wireless world. a. If I buy something deemed as premium by the Brand, I expect that product to be considered. Both through its design and it being ergonomic / fit for the task. Not only fit for the task, but beyond requirement. Too often a product is labelled as premium only for it to later be identified as inferior product. I heard a lot of negative press around the MArshal headphones for example, falling to pieces, the connections breaking etc. Tarnishing the brands reputation upon entering the commercial headphone market - and definitely tarnishing the reputation of their amps too.

b. The clothing and lifestyle store - GOODHOOD is a great example of premium. Every aspect of the service, product, packaging is above & beyond of whatwould usually be expected. It's a curation contemporary artefacts, forward thinking fashion brands and lifestyle good that upon purchasing you leave the store enriched and feeling good, whatever the price. https://goodhoodstore.com/mens Products are well made and by trusted artisans, brand labels. Service from staff is knowledgeable and refined, they live the life you are buying into and all contribute to the buying of stock.

c. Skull Candy. They're items, while purchased by some and i'm sure they do the job. Scull Candy product is not premium, from the Logo to the brand name, to the finished product. Gloss plastic casing, metallic plastic posing as metal and little thought for design. I really don't rate this brand or what they produce - I know its a cliche - but I literally wouldn't have a pair if I was payed. My most premium item is my record player - a 1987 (year i was born) model of the Rega Planar 2. It is a wooden construct - with matt varnished finish in black. The spin platter is glass and from a design perspective it is a much loved classic within the record player market,. UK designed and made. While they're not particularly rare - they relatively sought after and a great premium player. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing (in my opinion) but it is great at what it is designed to do. Play music.

I love it and would be really upset if it was ever stolen or damaged. The player has some sentimental meaning too as it was a present in which both my father and I chose for my birthday. I think premium equals quality equals the invite of sentimentality. Premium Headphone Brands -
Bose = Strong reputation and higher price point make Bose a premium brand. Use in establishments such as restaurants etc also affirms them as a good solid sound brand, however some of their brand choices, colours and finishes are trying to appeal to a lower price point market and dents their premium positioning I feel. SOme just look plain kiddy, and some look so silly 'IT techniciany' - not cool, bland and overly geeky :P
B&O = Same here in many ways, the notoriety and forward thinking design/nature of their past products. They border on future design classics with their shapes and finishes. Though, the price point unfortunately always reflects that.

More premium than others - 
Traits of premium for me is quite minimalist. With a good in-hand feel, weight and overall ergonomic design. While design is subjective, there's certain things that are pleasing to the eye, and things / shapes / edges / finishes that just aren't. While i don't find AIAIAI all that premium, they look like a design item and the finish clean and simple. Thats what i personally look for.

c. I like simplicity and premium feel to my headphones. Comfort through soft and breathable earphone cushions and i rarely deviate from black/charcoal grey colours. No contrasting or large logo's and all round minimal design. A nice feel to the wire as well - I've tried flat wires before and they're not preferable. They're heavy and meant the ear buds fell out regularly. (Brand: Toms) I sometimes think i share a little too much - I'm quite a passionate person and I realise i get my kicks by sharing things. From nights out, to activities i deem as different or interesting. 

A recent thing I shared with a few selected friends was a concept around immersive sound, in particular listening to great albums from the past in a pitchblack room. I'm an avid Outkast fan, i own all their albums on CD & vinyl & have quite literally got the Tshirt. I came across an instagram advert on my feed that caught my eye - Outkast's album 'Aquemini' being played in the pitch black in London Fields in early jan.

http://www.pitchblackplayback.com/events/

The ad was simple - just an image of the album cover - with minimal writing. I checkout out more on their instagram and had a ticket within minutes haha. I then sent out to my friends and got a few additional tickets as xmas presents for people i knew would enjoy it.  The opportunity to share something new, different and exciting appealed to me - something fun & different to do with my friends as we all get older and time poor. Often we have heated debates with regards to future issues - and I guess quite political in their origin. As we grow up together, we are also inevitably growing apart slightly and building our own opinions and thoughts. We don't always agree all the time anymore.

Themes we often discuss;
- Environment / trump / the need to change
- Wellness and support one another in high pressure working lives & relationships

These topics provoke debate as they are what we have been lumbered with. Millennials are becoming ever increasingly disengaged and the feeling of helplessness is growing. I believe it is this that makes us discuss such topics in detail, we have disagreements sometimes but always learn from the conversations we have.

I tend not to read the news, I actively avoid papers & rarely sit in front of the TV and  - however even scrolling down any social media these days is a bombardment of opinions and news. As much as there is a constant bombardment around all our chosen inputs i find it relatively easy to ignore these and focus solely on what I have chosen and what interests me. I am a relatively liberal person, i read around the mind and mental wellness more than most maybe and enjoy trying to learn how to remain sane in this high pressure world and escape the hustle & bustle. I try to avoid the usual slog and rat race - i prefer not working to working (sounds stupid to mention - but what I mean is I no longer rely on work as a source of self esteem) I truly believe a lot of people are working too hard.... and for what? I like to think i'm a through and through positive person who trips on cynicism from time to time.

I think i would change outlooks on work life balance and try to inspire more people to chase THEIR dreams, stop making other rich through your constant hard work and enrich your life. I think more people are convinced they do this already than actually do. So, I would some how change the way people think to make it a lot more inward and refocus their attention to their welfare, health and spiritual growth. Working as a brand manager for 9 years now and studying advertising for the 3 years prior to that at degree level - i'm relatively brand aware. But it also makes me a little 'roll-eyes' at brands attempts to capture attention and muscle into your feed / eyes / brains, having been in amongst it there are a few brands I respect for what they do.

Getting it right (for me)..

Nike - Nike are constantly and relatively quietly pushing things forwards, the amount other brands replicate what they do is sometimes embarrassing and i truly believe without them we would no be where we are in many ways with regards to pure sport innovation. Obviously i am more than aware it is all for commercial pay off - but what isn't, these guys are (on the whole) doing good things both internationally and at a local level.

Maharishi - I love Maharishi for their premium nature, through & through. Im a fan of repeat pattern and DPM camouflage a little more than the average person having studied Printmaking in the past and being a really visual person. They don't shout loud about what they do put create great collabs & really have their finger on the pulse in the surplus look fashion trend.. which, in many ways hasn't really left fashion for a decade now. They take great editorial shots, don't advertise and often have a story / reason for being with most of their products / collections. The brand also touches on the history of war and international militaries, how they did it differently.

Getting it wrong (for me)..

Brands that sacrifice their brand equity for a quick buck, a short term win financially etc are not something I care much for. I find it hard to think of recent examples of this, but generally brands that try to extend themselves into something else annoys me. I hate trend only brands like Ellesse & Fila (at the moment) and anything that isn't there for good in the top flight.. they just dip in and out. I hated other trend brands like Von Dutch etc. Horrid.

Brands that haven't found their tangible story and reason for existing is hard to invest time or interest in for me. They just mirror other brands and feed off consumers that are buying things just because their friends buy them. I probably think about brands too much due to it being my job to critique, lead and improve brands. But below is a run down of al the headphone brands I can think of in three categories;

Negative - Skull Candy, iPhone headphones, Beats, Phillips

Neutral - Sony, Panosonic, V-Moda, JBL,

Positive - AIAIAI, B&O, RHA, Bose Be different. Be unique and stand for something. Genuinely want to make headphones better and listen to your consumers. Don't just blur into the background and become a grey boring brand like many have. Bring newness and continued innovation to the market, collaborate and empower others lesser than yourself to connect with your target market. 

If its youth - select ambassadors and genuinely benefit artists. Not just give them your headphones, work with them - help to better sound etc. Genuinely care about sound being 

If its John Lewis shoppers - how can you benefit them in the home. Make new waterproofness or durability that helps them day to day.

Brand sneed to connect with whats important for that consumer - for me it is sound and affordability. A balance between being great technology wise, but not tinkering onto the geek side of things - while remaining within a price point thats realistic for something you put on your head and hear things through. Overly pricey headphones put me off - as the differences will often simply be the brand name.",Sonic,ENFP
295462,Lois,Browne,lois.browne91@gmail.com,"One of the items that I own which I'm most proud of is my Crosley Keepsake Record Player. 
This was my second record player which I pined for over 6 months, as I had bought a model before this one which didn't last as long as it should, 
due to reducing in sound quality after using it only a few times which indicated to me it lacked longevity and was disappointing as I bought 
it'd as recommendation which had come from a friend who had the same model. 

I requested this particular model for a Christmas present and I've never looked back. 
It still possess great sound quality, it's a focal point of my room- as I live in quite a small room and like the idea of knowing that 
as soon as someone enters my room it would mark me as music lover (unless they see the vinyl first on my floor). In addition I love the fact it fits with aesthetic of my colour scheme which is monochrome, however I think the extra hint of colour adds a bit of fun and interest to the case. Plus 
I'm able to use the lid to display records, art works or any ornaments so it also allows me to decorate/ personalise my room in that way too. 
It's portable and can convert your vinyl records using a USB system to digital, a handy touch to have these days as some records I possess you don't 
always get digital download codes with. 

After browsing the range of Crosley Record Players I settled on this, as I felt itmade a visual statement. 
Plus it was actually an exclusive Urban Outfitter release and collaboration so I also indulged in the fact not many people would have the exact same model, as individuality is very important to me.

You can play records of all inches at all three different speeds: 33, 45, 78 Rpm and the needle is easy to change too. 

I've had the player for 4 years and it still remains strong. I always knew about Bose, as a company renowned for some of the best and highest quality products for headphones and speakers. 
And others such as Sennheiser due to the fact I used to DJ when I was at at end of my sixth form college days and my first year of university, 
so sound quality, good clarity and longevity are some of the factors I shopped for when buying headphones and these traits have stayed with me since then. 

I did want another set of higher end headphones, but they were out of my price range and Bose's prices were more affordable. 
After browsing Bose's full range of headphones I settled on the Sound True On-Ear/ Over-Ear Headphones as they possessed the qualities I was looking for in regards to great sound, one year's warranty, the colour and it came with a carry case. The ear-cups were replaceable too which added longevity to it as well, meaning I didn't have to worry about replacing the whole thing even when there was nothing wrong with the sound it's self. I also was able to purchase them on sale at a reduced rate, which made me buying them even more glorious as I knew I was getting an awesome product at a special price without any strings attached. I got them for £70 approx when they were retailing for about £120 approx, on Black Friday from Argos. The warranty was the main asset which settled my mind on these, as I use my headphones practically everyday and I wanted rot ensure they could withstand the years as they were an investment piece for me. 

I purchased these new headphones as my previous ones Marshalls (In white) had been destroyed by my cat and I was using quite basic over the ear Sony headphones temporarily, but they weren't easy to transport and after owning Marshall headphones they lacked in sound. I want to hear every layer and level when I listen to my music, an attribute that is integral to any purchase. One you've uncovered a great level of sound it's hard to go back to an average pair of headphones and this was something the Sound True model offered. 

I would be willing to pay extra for extended warranty, wireless features, if they came with an experience such as listening sessions to exclusive albums (something I think Sonos does). As well as a new replacement service if they got damaged accidentally. a)
i) I prefer over-ear headphones as I like the comfort of the ear cups. From doing research I've also read that they are better for your ear health, as it doesn't go directly in to the ear drum and the sound is more equally balanced with this type, plus it allows me to actually hear some of my outside surroundings even if they're on a moderate volume as I find you don't need to make them as loud. Where with previous in ear headphones I've used you can't always hear what's happening around as they isolate the sound and normally have to be raised higher, which isn't always safe especially if you're travelling at night such as I do. Lastly on practicalities they're my first preference as I have ear piercings which wouldn't work as well with in ear models and they're easier to find in my bag- as a smaller model would take more time to source as carry a lot of items on the go. 

ii) I understand the practicality of wireless headphones, but I still like the wired headphones as it has that more retro/ old school look to them. My Bose headphones allow me to control the volume, answer calls and pause and play music with the small controller as when I commute I like to handle my phone directly as little as possible if I can. However I've never used Wireless headphones but I'm open to experimenting. I just wonder whether in terms of energy/ electricity usage if they would be more wasteful as you'd need to charge them and I would prefer to use a product which as eco-friendly as possible. 

iii) As I've stated I'm not a fan of in-earphones and haven't used any of these types so do I cannot answer this question sufficiently. 

All the answers I am writing from own personal experiences of the brands I've used. As I've highlighted I'm not familiar with all these types but I will try to answer these questions to best of my ability.

ii) Bose Sound True On-Ear Headphones

v) n/a
vi) n/a a) If I buy something which is premium I expect the product to be made to most highest quality within the price range which it has been made. Featuring exclusive assets specific to that one item or brand and has technology/ attributes you don't find in an everyday product. It's far above the average. I expect it to have longevity in terms of wear and tear, which includes a decent warranty spanning 1-2 years with a customer service which is professional, quick, efficient and actually listens to your needs and takes on your issues seriously. 

b)I received a premium customer service experience with my Bose Sound True On-Ear Headphones, as when I contacted their lines directly I was always put through to an operator quickly. Each model also came with a serial number you'd have to give them to set up an account online too, which I only had to give the first time I got in touch. I had to order my replacement ear-cups, as ones before were on their way out and I feared it would takes ages. But after the call I got them delivered with in two days and didn't have to pay for them as they were covered by my two year warranty.  This was a premium service as the operator was polite, listened to my needs and quickly knew how to solve my problem without any qualms. 

c) Primark a high street fast-fashion chain, is not premium in my eyes. 
The products price point make them convenient to purchase from. However because the items aren't usually made using the highest quality fabrics, hence the low prices they do not last that long or have as much wear time. Sometimes these products have bubbled quickly or the stitching has come undone easily, so I usually shop here as a temporary fix if my funds are low or to buy some of my fashion basics, e.g socks. The presentation of the store can be quite messy and isn't always the tidiest and the sales assistants aren't always the most forthcoming too. The most premium item I own is my faux Epiphone Les Paul Custom (the real one is pictured below, as it's somewhere in my loft)
I bought it years ago with an amp from Denmark Street, when I used to play guitar during my teens I think stopped playing 
when I was 14 officially. But picked it up again in my late teens/ early twenties to start practicing again as a few friends of mine wanted to create a
all girl multi-ethnic punk/ alternative band. 

I got this item as it was one of my favourite guitarists' guitars during my teens Frank Iero, from My Chemical Romance and he played the original Epiphone Les Paul Custom, 
so I wanted the exact same. It was at least half the cost as it was still a hobby at the time and I don't think my mother who helped me buy it wanted to spend extortionate 
amounts in case I neglected it one day which I did come to do. But when I was younger it was my dream to be a guitarist in a band and that was my aim for a good few years. 

I think it says that I'm interested in monochromatic colour schemes, that I idolised Frank Iero massively as I felt getting any other guitar wouldn't make me happy. Even though now I reflect on it I should have just bought a Fender Stratocaster.  As well as the fact I'm a musician, appreciate classic guitars and ultimately was a bit of a rocker. 

Whilst I don't play anymore when I used to play it made me feel as if I was progressing with my development, as when I first start playing guitar I started playing a classical Spanish guitar, which was acoustic. But I had been inspired to play by the bands I admired such as Blink 182, Deftones and the range of alternative bands I used to listen to and I always saw progression as moving to electric which brought me closer to my goal of playing in a band one day. It was a different set up and I had to learn chords instead of just picking the strings which was a skill mainly associated with classical, plus as I bought it with a guitar strap this was the first time I started experimenting with playing whilst standing up, as before then it had all been sitting. It also just made me feel generally like a bad-ass too when playing it. a) The headphone brands which I think are premium are Bowers and Wilkens, Bose and Bang & Olufsen.
These products are all premium as they offer warranty which spans at least 1-2 years, implying these products are meant to have longevity and usually do. Plus it means there's a definite promise of customer service from the moment you purchase, so you know it's an investment.  
They also possess exclusive design attributes specific to that brand or model or headphone and stylistically they look durable and fashionable. 

b) I think there are some models which are more premium than others for instance when I bought my Bose Sound True On-Ear Headphones, there was another model above which was the Sound True Over-Ear which cost more and had a larger cup size, so were more noise cancelling. Plus there was the option to have this sort of style as a wireless though my model only came with the wire. Certain models are slightly more advanced than others. 

c) I think there are some headphone features that are more premium than others. For instance my Sony MDRV150 DJ Headphones (which I keep as spare headphones) in comparison to my Bose Sound True On-Ear Headphones are lacking. Firstly they did not come with a warranty, which is most likely due to the price range as they cost about £20 max. My Bose Sound True On-Ear headphones not only came with a 1-2 year warranty, but they're able to be folded away into a travel case which it came with. Plus the ear cups were replaceable meaning I could keep the product looking fresh, as one of the issues with standard headphones is that ear cups would get worn out and because of that you'd have to get new ones even if the sound hadn't been affected. The E1 x Percolate New Year's Eve Party line up link via Resident Advisor. 
I saw the event firstly on Facebook just as a poster and a few of my favourite DJ names in the mix such as 
Daphni, Eclair Fifi and Floating Points and from that moment onwards I was set on this being my NYE celebration. 
As all these DJs whenever I've seen them I've had an amazing time and met incredible people during their sets. 
Plus they all bring together a fusion of electronic, disco, house and more and I usually only see this sort of a selection of 
that many insane DJs on a festival line up. 

https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1176778 Music and politics (socialist ideas)

I think they all provoke debate as politics, around the globe has seen a shift to far-right populist ideas which has caused an a hostile environment that has meant an increase Islamophobic attacks, an anti-immigrant and refugee perspective and even the Windrush Generation scandal and has lowered people's tolerances for diversity, which hasn't been helped by people such as public figures such as Donald Trump and Tommy Robinson spreading racist ideologies and hate with their beliefs and policies. It's relevant at a time to discuss as the majority of the people want a society which is inclusive and accept difference, which is why when more than a quarter million people marched against Trump in summer this was triumphant.  Music always creates discussion as the industry has morphed so much in the way people consume and at the rate it's produced, plus the mediums it's available in have extended and the classification of music of genres is less important and eclectic- with a larger variation of influences going into one sound. 

My opinion on politics comes from being on the left and part of the Socialist Worker's Party with most of my theory coming from Karl Marx. I believe that capitalism needs to overthrown and we can do through the workers uniting and not being divided by systematic/ capitalist conventions such as racism and homophobia, which detracts people from the actual state who are causing austerity through cuts and policies which only benefit the wealthy. Most of my information I have read from books, newspapers and from discussing the current climate which is hard to deny with others on the left. In regards to music I think fans are far more fickle now and I almost think the high volume of music means that fans don't commit themselves to specific musicians and tend to have a select few they favour. I also think it's important that music is purchased, as whilst streaming on platforms such as Spotify it's rare for artist starting out to make a living. So I always encourage buying music, attending live gigs and buying merchandise too. 

I get my news from links I've found on Facebook, which might take me to the Guardian, ID, Vox.com, VICE or from reading online music websites such as Pitchfork and Clash magazine. I also get news updates through the news app on my iPhone linked to the Independent, New York Times and Huffington Post. 

I would change racism as it's a capitalist construct which was created to justify slavery. As a black woman I've experienced racist situations, they leave you feeling angry, demeaned and upset. Disliking someone purely on the basis of their skin colour is such a simplistic thing and I hope to live in a world one day where people don't get attacked or verbally abused because of this. It's a global problem and needs to go and only creates divisions. 1. Vegan and cruelty free make up brands such as Lime Crime, Kiko, Urban Decay and Kat Von D are some the brands I think are getting it right. As they have given vegans/ vegetarians the alternatives with a vast range of colours to pick from across lips, cheeks and eyes. Minus the guilt-free nature of using other brands that still test on animals, which is not necessary when you shop around. 

2. Brands that are getting it wrong are Pepsi. I know it was a while back but I don't like it when brands try to cash in on political movements/ activism just because they think it's cool. While their brand has always been corporate and rarely gives back to the community. 

3. Whilst this may be slightly contradictory to my reason in number two I think the Nike x Colin Kaepernick endorsement was great, as it showed solidarity with all those NFL players  who had been cut off their teams but also that they resonated with Black Lives Matter movement. A great move as it acknowledged they know that a large section of their customer base comes from the black community. 

4. n/a One of my favourite ever headphones were my Marshall Major II Headphones in white. 
If I was the CEO I would ensure that the product has a service once a year, to ensure the product is 
working to its optimum always. This would be with a technical expert of the brand and model/ series model of 
headphones. With the inclusion of a 5 year warranty.",Sonic,
295463,Lorenzo,Cisi,lorenzo.cisi@gmail.com,"The item I own that I am most proud of is probably my Bolex H16 film camera.
I bought it on Ebay as its a very rare piece of film equipment and cannot be found in stores easily.
I use it regularly to film 16mm analog footage, both for pleasure and work purposes.

I am extremely proud of owning such a great camera, an icon of the cinematography industry that still produce amazing videos.
Its technology and quality is still appreciated after so many years and despite my model as been produced in the 60s it feels so modern to shoot with.

I believe it will maintain its charm for centuries... '- I discovered my favourite pair of headphones (Master and Dynamic MH40) through online researches, 
I really like to visit first specific websites dedicated to products / design and then dig more, trying to find reviews and opinions on various forums.
Sometimes I watch Youtube reviews.

- Mostly I chose the Master and Dynamic MH40 for their design and built quality, the sound quality as well matched my expectations.

- I needed a new pair of headphones that was functional both for travelling and professional work on audio/video editing, therefore design / comfort / sound quality were the main points I was looking into.

- Because I needed something with great performances for my work sessions, the price was not much in consideration. I would happily pay a bit more if the same model has bluetooth connectivity, when travelling is a game changer!

- I mostly read online forums and watched Youtube reviews about the product

- I bought them on Amazon as it was the cheapest option, 350£

- I had the chance to try them on before committing to the purchase and the feeling of wearing them over the ears is incredible.
I've never felt such great materials and quality in a pair of headphones and when you look at them closely there are so many little details that create a stunning piece of design.' A.
i. I personally prefer the feeling of over hear headphones, there is no other physical way of getting that immersion into the sound.
ii. I prefer wired headphones, the sound quality through wireless connection is still not as great as a good old cable.
iii. I don't own a wireless set but I would probably go with True Wireless buds. They seems super functional in those situations you really don't want any wires (travelling, running, sport activities etc..)

B.

i. Master and Dynamics 
ii. Grado Labs
iii. Grado Labs
iv. Master and Dynamics
v. Bose
vi. Sennheiser a. A premium product / service for me is something that has been designed / crafted by experts and with the use of high quality materials. I expect the product to last longer and to produce better results than similar products on the market. 

b. Moscot Sunglasses - I've struggled for a while to find a great pair of sunglasses and Moscot was a great discovery. A great piece of classic timeless design.
For me they are premium because they kept the original vintage look but upgraded and built with modern materials, the details are incredibly refined and their lenses are superior to any other sunglasses I tried. I lost one pair and I went straight away to buy a replacement without hesitation.

c. Pretty much all fast fashion brands (Zara - H&M - Primark...) I don't really buy their products as the quality is extremely poor and I can totally feel it when wearing them. I am not a big fan of their strategy to sell cheap and almost disposable clothing, forcing you to buy them again and again because they wear off so fast. '- Contax G2 Film Camera. Its the best photography camera I ever owned and taking photos with it is definitely an experience, It was produced by Contax in the 80s using the best materials and technologies of the time and I believe it still is a step ahead of modern digital cameras. Such a shame they don't produce them anymore.

- Owning this camera tell and confirm that I am a person extremely attracted and focused on quality and uniqueness of products.

- Naturally it makes me feel a professional in taking photos, but it also fun and effortless to shoot with it. It enhance the experience of shooting on film knowing that it will deliver incredible results at all times.' a. Master and Dynamics / Bose / Sennheiser
They are all premium for their sound, design and built Quality.

b. I haven't tried different models than the one I owned, therefore I cannot really tell if other models of the same brands feel more premium.

c. Different types of connectivity (having wired and wireless option in the same model) / Use of high quality materials such as leather and metal instead of plastic. It was not something that I saw / read / heard but is a new surfboard I bought in California. After trying it I had to share the excitement and the quality of it with all my surf buddies. 
Surfboards are like shoes, they need to feel right under your feet and perform exactly as you like. I was so excited about it that I even let some friends try it and in the surf industry is a big deal. Is not very common that someone let you try his/her board =)
The fact that surfboards are mostly hand made and are all unique pieces was even more exciting for me a. Music and Movies tastes / politics.

b. I believe that even if nowadays people are bombarded with so many informations, most of us have very strong personal aesthetics and tastes. Generally we have a lot in common but sometimes when we don't agree on something we try endlessly to convince each other of the reason why something is well made or not.

c. I always try to keep an open mind on every topic and listen the opinion of other people, its a big part of my job as well.
I usually inform myself through online websites / books first and then I like to discuss about it with other people to see different interpretation of the same topic.
That's when the conversation gets interesting.

d. Mostly online website, online news and social media / platforms. (Wired - Dazed - Vice for example).

e. I would like to see a world free of boundaries and restriction between countries. Although I understand the concept of nations and appreciate the existence of  cultures and heritage, I think everyone should be free to visit and live everywhere in the world and contribute to the growth of humanity in their own way (naturally respecting other people and laws). It would be so beneficial for humanity opening new horizons of development. Conservative approaches will not move us forward. 1. In my opinion Jeep is doing really well in promoting their cars and advertising them to the right audience, they are promoting their product engaging with a specific group of people passionate about extreme sports / adventures and wildlife. Their product fits perfectly in this environment, and while other car brands keep producing advertisements showing only the product in a cold, ""too much perfect"" fictional world, Jeep narrate engaging stories and true life experiences that people can relate with.

2. Ryanair, I personally think (without getting to much in details) they failed in all aspects of their development, from the service they provide to marketing strategies. Other competitors provide much better service for travelling in the same price range.

3. I really liked the outcome of the collaboration between Fred Perry and Raf Simons. They kept the heritage and quality of the brand (that was getting a bit boring and old fashion in my opinion) and they rejuvenate the products with the input of such a great and forward thinking designer.
Also Beats by Dr Dre was obviously a very successful production and strategy although I am not a big fan of their products, too much hype for a mediocre product.

4. Again Raf Simons with Calvin Klein, is the opposite scenario compared to his collaboration with Fred Perry. They merged a forward thinking and artsy designer with a super commercial and fast consuming brand. The audience didn't respond well to this drastic change, the brand missed their targets and the sales went down. (They just announced that Raf Simons after only 2 years is exiting CK). I believe that sometimes you can't really control the outcome of a collaboration or partnership and the success is all about the audience choice which is quite hard to predict in advance. I would develop the products with the input from experts of the field first but more important collaborate with worldwide-known artists, musicians, designer and public figures that have a high role in the creative field. I would as well use those people as testimonials or endorsers in all advertising campaigns.
The advertisement should communicate the story behind the product and the emotions you can feel owning it.",Sonic,

How much was price a consideration? What features would you be willing to pay more for?  

I wanted a pair that were around £100 as from looking at the market, this seemed like a price where you can get something really quite good without going mental on price. The difference between £50 and £100 was huge, the difference between £100 and £300 wasn't all that (for my needs). Not really any features I'd pay more for to be honest, unless the £100 ones started not being made with noise cancelling and were uncomfortable (i.e. if inflation meant I couldn't get the above question's things)

Where did you look for/get information to help you make the decision?

Online blogs / articles / gadget journos

Where and when did you buy these? How much did you pay?

Amazon - I think they were ~£100 at the time

What ultimately sold you on these headphones?

How they looked versus the others I was comparing them too - they looked awesome What is your preference on the following? Please explain why you prefer one over the other:

Over-ear vs. on-ear headphones

Over-ear - I feel more 'stable' wearing these, I feel like on ear moves around and doesn't really lock me in. Over ear feels more immersive

Wireless vs. wired headphones

Wired - simply because I hate having bluetooth on

Wireless earphones vs. true wireless buds 

Earphones
Buds don't work for women - we don't have pockets to put them in when we take them out and if we put them in our bag we'll lose them at the bottom. Such a faff, not worth it. At least with earphones you have something to hold onto, hang onto somewhere (neck)

What brand and model do you think wins in each of these sub-categories?

Over-ear headphones - Bose / Sennheiser

On-ear headphones - don't know as not really paid attention to the brand when trying them as never wanted to buy them

Wireless headphones - Bose / Sennheiser

Wired headphones - Bose / Sennheiser

Wireless earphones - don't know as not really paid attention to the brand when trying them as never wanted to buy them

True wireless buds - don't know as not really paid attention to the brand when trying them as never wanted to buy them a) It works without hassle, it feels good, it looks good, it's simple, it's noticeably a lot better than 'normal'

b) Third Space gym
i) This is the stupidly expensive gym I go to and omg I love it. 
ii) It's got insanely nice equipment, it always smells nice, the changing rooms are huge and have everything you need (you don't need to bring a towel/ shower gel / hairdryer / straighteners - nothing, it's all there), there's always staff about to help you, it's a pleasure to be there, I feel special when I'm there, it's a nice place to be (not like usual gyms that are loud, smelly, busy etc), I feel 'looked after' when I'm there, there's loads of choice of classes etc which I don't actually make much use of but I like to know I have access if I so please

c) Pret a Manger
i) One of the ones in the centre of London
ii) It's messy, always busy, loud, options are never that great, it's not designed that well so it feels stressful to be in there trying to find your way through folk deciding what they want, the queue, getting out the queue once you've ordered etc etc...it's simply quite a stressful place (when busy) and you're just another number I don't really own anything premium but I'd say it's the gym I subscribe to - as described in the previous answer - Third Space.

a) please see previous answer

b) it says I'm serious about fitness, that I have the money to afford an expensive gym, that I'm the sort of person that is a bit fussy about the places I hang out haha..!

c) It makes me feel really special. Like I'm treating myself, every time I walk in. I feel like I'm investing both in my physical health but also in my general demeanor by choosing to spend extra to feel good about going to the gym. I feel proud when I go as I'm making an active decision to look after my body, and I wouldn't really do that as often in not as nice surroundings. It's like I've invested in an expensive thing to force myself to do exercise, by making it a treat as opposed to a chore. I feel like I'm in good company when I'm there as it's either other folk like me (i.e. spending a lot on the gym to make themselves go!) there or folk who are super serious about fitness (there's a few Olympians etc who go there), and those 2 groups are nice ones to share a gym with! a) I think of Bose and Sennheiser as premium - they look, sound and feel good - don't know whether it's the branding and price that make me feel like this (as I wouldn't say I'm an expert in knowing what makes a good set of headphones sound perfect etc), but that's the perception I have of them

b) For me, over-ear feels more premium as they feel more 'serious'. Don't know enough about models.

c) Proper Noise cancelling feels premium to me - the idea of seriously wanting to shut out the world to only hear what you're choosing to hear is kind of the definition of premium right? Nowadays premium means 'less people around me' (think airport lounges etc) - you're buying the experience of not being bothered! a) A Little Life by Hanya Yanahighara 
b) A friend recommended it to me
c) The story is AMAZING - this book has a bit of a cult following and I'm 100% bought in and proud haha - not something I normally read but I was totally immersed for over 700 pages and I was so sad when it finished. This book has had a lasting effect.
4) https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Life-Hanya-Yanagihara/dp/0385539258 What are the topics or themes that provoke heated discussion in your group of friends?  

Whether or not Facebook is evil
Hippy stuff - is it lame or not
Career stuff - ways of dealing with certain situations

Why do you think these topics provoke debate in this day and age?

There are lots of different ways of approaching the problem and there's no one right answer. People also like to be 'different'.

What was your opinion on these? How did you form this opinion? E.g. Where do you look for trusted information to this topic? Online, books, newsletters, other people.

Facebook is definitely evil, but is a necessity for the life I lead
Hippy stuff is lame and you can get all the stuff they go on about in 'normal' activities anyway (you don't need meditation to be a calm, fulfilled person people!)
Career stuff I always say that the only person  who really cares about your career is you, so do what YOU think is best and sod any societal / managerial perspectives. Jobs are super fluid nowadays so you don't need other peoples' approval to do stuff.

Form opinions from my own experiences, from reading a lot of different things from various sources, from conferences, from travelling, from having friends from all different walks of life and hearing their perspectives, from having an open mind and being generally open to changing it, but also being critical and not just believing something straight off the bat. 

Trusted publications like Guardian, FT, Economist, Quartz etc

How do you keep up to date with what’s happening in the world? 

NEWSLETTERS. I bloody love a newsletter - I wrote about it here: https://medium.com/theres-method-in-the-madness/30-newsletters-i-couldnt-live-without-540cb6f4692
And Twitter too 
(And I'll read stuff from sources I trust which have been linked to via newsletters and twitter)

If you could change one thing in the world, what would it be? Why?

Every single person would critically THINK about what they are reading and not take anything as gospel. 
I think most of the issues - at least in the developed world - come from a serious lack of critical thinking and a laziness in consuming information, believing hype etc.
(I'm writing a book on this right now so it's really front of mind...but I do think this does lead to the entire planet being in a better position, not just wealthy people being more informed) (I really don't know enough headphone brands / have a strong opinion on them so not sure I can put a headphone brand in all of them...)

In your opinion, what brands are getting it right? Why are they getting it right?
Bose - they ooze premium and 'for folk who actually give a shit about how they listen to stuff'
Headspace - very zeitgeist

What brands are getting it wrong? Why?

Reader's Digest - they just updated their website and I think they were trying to be modern but it is completely lacking in direction in terms of who it is for and frankly just makes me feel really sorry for them!! I really want them to do well!!
Apple - those ear buds are stupid and using their influence on the industry to make it complicated for folk to plug headphones into phones / laptops is so infuriating. I think people are really starting to lose patience, there's a lack of innovation that we came to expect with every new thing that comes out. 

In your opinion, what recent brand collaborations, endorsements or partnerships have absolutely nailed it? Why?

Mercedes / SXSW - they do a mini conference in Germany that's got the same feel as the Austin conference, and has the focus on auto industry and I think it was such an intelligent move by both brands. Makes it cool and positions Mercedes in a really interesting space. 
Only headphone one I can think of is Dr Dre / Beats. Think it's maybe out of date now? But at the time it was insanely good. Especially around the Olympics (did Dr Dre even have anything to do with that?! Sorry!)

Which ones have missed the mark? Why?

Asda / Greenpeace and their Xmas ad - started off well, but was soon 'debunked' and has made a lot of people turn cynical / distrusting of both
I'm sorry I'm really trying to wrack my brains for more headphone examples but nothing is coming to mind...! I'd position themselves as the brand for the digital nomad / the self employed / the young freelancer. There is emerging zeitgeist around this area and there are SO many communities popping up which would be easy to get involved with and help prop up. If they could play a role in helping these young freelancers somehow - maybe with their admin or their access to opportunities or something - they would be seen as a real help. It could also be cool to have them as a sort of 'flag' of being a person like this - if you saw someone on the tube wearning the headphones you could know that they are 'like you' - again, as there is such a strong community around freelancers this could be an awesome way to position themselves.",Sonic,
295469,Jess,Battle,jessicabattle@live.co.uk,"This is a Christmas ornament I made of my Nan. It means a lot to me because I was extremely close to my Nan growing up and it’s a special to me. I’m proud that I made it myself and that it holds value for my family and will continue to do so for years to come. I first heard about Marley headphones about 2 years ago, I was bought them as a gift because I had been complaining about how annoying I was getting using in ear headphones.
I sadly misplaced my gifted pair and so bought a new pair.
The reason I decided to buy a new pair was firstly, the comfort of them. They're lightweight and very soft on the ear/head. I decided that I wasn't going to keep using in ear headphones all the time. 
My considerations were first and foremost comfort, secondly the quality of sound. 
I'm not clued up on a lot of tech so my price range was between £15 - £30. I was willing to pay a little extra if i found a pair of wireless headphones.
I have to be honest and say I didn't do any research, I'd had them briefly before and knew that I already liked them, so i just hopped on amazon and bought the exact same pair. 
I bought these about a year and a half ago on amazon and paid £12.99 as they were on offer on the site.
what ultimately sold me on these particular headphones was the comfort and light weight of them, they had a range of semi-neutral colours which is what I like, as I think they look more discreet that brightly coloured headphones. I prefer over ear headphones over on-ear headphones as they provide maximum comfort and in my experience better sound. I associate on-ear headphones with tangles wires, fearing I will catch them on something and have the earphones themselves ripped off or caught on something.

I prefer wireless headphones over wired headphones, this is because the ease of movement and not worrying the wire will be caught on something, as I mentioned above. the only con of wireless headphones is the having to remember to charge them, but if you are organised and get into the habit of charging them I would say wireless would be my first choice.

I prefer wireless earphones over true wireless buds because to me, for some strange reason they just feel more secure and I think I would have more difficulty in trying to find the buds as opposed to the wireless earphones. But having said that I have not ever used true wireless buds.

Over- ear headphones - JBL Tune 500BT 
On ear headphones - Marley Positive Vibration 2.0 Wireless Headphones
Wireless headphones - Sony MDR
Wired headphones - House of Marley Smile Jamaica In Ear
Wireless earphones - I don't think I can answer this as I've never personally used them, but I have heard good things about The House of Marley Smile Jamaica wireless set.
True wireless buds - Again it's not something I've personally used but friends and colleagues of mine always use their Apple ear buds. If something is labelled as premium, to me that means something is that little bit extra special. It implies to me that something is a little more luxurious or of better quality in general. Or something that saves time and is more convenient, that a regular version of something. 
Something I would class as a premium service would be Amazon Prime. It's something I use almost every day and I think its worth the money. I think this falls into the premium category for a number of reasons. It gives my orders/parcel priority over other, it comes soon, almost always the next day and something the same day if I am lucky, it makes thing very convenient and helps me when I'm in a rush. I also enjoy the extra's I get with amazon Prime, the tv and movies I can watch, the music I can stream. I think for something so cheap, it gives you great value for money.

To me the opposite of premium is something cheap/affordable. For this reason I would say McDonalds is a brand/company that is definitely not premium.
The food is cheap, the labour is cheap, the quality is low and its unhealthy to boot. Lots of people flock to places like this out of habit or familiarity but don't think about the long term affects, nobody goes into McDonalds expecting a 5 star meal, they go in a rush or because they're feeling a little lazy. For the money you pay for some items, the value of the food you are getting is very poor. Its a large company that does very little to give back to its customers and there is no real benefit to eating at a McDonalds restaurant. This is my 13inch MacBook Air which I purchased in 2013.
I think that Apple products can be a little bit of a hit and miss depending on what type of person you are. Some people may look at me with my laptop and think that I am tech savvy or do a job which allows me to afford a more expensive laptop as opposed to others than are on the market. Others may think I am a brand snob and am loyal to Apple products as I have an iPhone also.
When I look at my laptop it gives me a little sense of pride, I bought this laptop when I was working at a small retail job, but I has saved my money over a long period of time and it was the first 'big' purchase I bought to treat myself. It reminds me of how hard I worked to save the pennies to afford it. I like that its sleek and it shows that it is easily customisable. I would consider Beats by Dre to be the top of the premium list. This is because of how popular they seem and the high price tag. the few people I know that have Beats earphones swear by them and would not go back to another brand.
I'm not the most tech savvy person so in honest truth I don't know which models are more premium than others. I find shopping for things like headphones very overwhelming because of the amount of choice there is out there, and different headphones seem to specialise if different things. I think a lot of other consumers feel the same way if they are not in an industry that uses sound technology, or if you're not someone who is very picky about what brand/features you want. 
I would associate premium features to be wireless, noise cancelling, long battery life, good mic quality and a range of styles/colours. The first time I listened to the podcast called You, Me & The big C, it was about 3 women talking about cancer in a very honest and open way. They shed light on what living with cancer is actually like and how its about time we normalised certain aspects of what is essentially a very sad and tricky topic.
I caught the end of the show's promotion on the radio on BBC 5 Live and was eager to find out more. 

This excited me, as some one who has been affected by cancer and has friends also suffering with the awful disease, it was refreshing to hear 3 young women talking openly and honestly about their experiences. They talk about the highs and the lows of dealing with cancer and it isn't just a good listen if you or someone you know if affected by cancer, its also very eye opening to listen to no matter or age or health status. It's not as depressing as you would first think and I found those 3 women so inspiring and funny that I just had to share it with my friend who is going through treatment at the moment. 

I can't share the private message which I sent her, but I can telly you that after listening to the first 3 podcasts, she was also hooked, and we still are to this day. Homophobic and transphobic and racist issues are always a heated discussion in my group, not because anybody I mingle with is any of those things but I do think a lot of them are guilty of being too passive about serious issues that need urgent help, and people need to raise their voices about.

I think that with the current US and UK governments its hard to ignore these issues, hate crimes are on the rise and people seem to only want to whip out their phones to take videos or pictures instead of raising their voices and getting involved in trying to help the problems.

I don't think its an opinion, I believe it is basic human nature to be kind and to let others live freely without fear of prejudice or retaliation about something as so normal and natural as their sexuality or the colour of their skin or the country they were born in. I know this because I have met these people, I have friends and family who are trans, anything other than 'straight' and as a white cis women I definitely know I am at an advantage in life, but it shouldn't be that way, it should be a level playing field for all. 
for updates on these kinds of issues and other feminist issues, I head to blogs, or catch up on social media with my friends who rally and campaign for change.

The news honestly depresses me, but I do head over to the various websites covering the news. It ranges from the BBC to Vice, depending on what has caught my eye on social media and I want to know more. 

If I could change one thing in the world it would be the hate. So many people in this world are consumed by hate and it does them and the people around them, the countries they lead, nothing but misery and misfortune. I would want to eradicate that kind of narrow minded thinking and let everybody just get on with their lives with at least stress and worry as possible. 
A close second is climate change! It's scary how little people are about our planet too! 1. I think Beats have got it on the mark. I mentioned previously that I don't even own a pair of have even tried them out before, but they are known globally and sought after by many as a luxury item. I think that goes to show how clever they are with their products and their marketing. Another brand I think is growing and because of a good reason, is one I have actually tried this time, which is Jeffree Star cosmetics. The quality of the products i have received is at a very high standard, and very good for the price. They are also ethically friendly and all products are vegan and cruelty free.

2. When it comes to headphones I think Phillips are failing in the sound department. they focus heavily on the design and special features such as waterproof and 'sweatproof' but the sound is lacking, Phillips come across as a little dated now I think. 
I think when it comes to food brands I think Aldi are getting it wrong. Yes it is very cheap and very its very good value for money, but the amount of unnecessary packaging and plastic is crazy! Its very hard to take advantage of their good deals when very few produce items are sold individually and instead are wrapped in masses of extra plastic that often cannot be recycled.

3. The recent brand collaboration between Disney and Beats has been very eye catching, and also clever, they've cashed in on the reputable name they've made for themselves with Beats, not only with them being a hit with celebrities but now they have pulled in more of an audience/younger audience by collaborating with Disney, a very smart move of their part I think.
In a totally different area, the new supermarket Jack's being opened in a select locations around the UK as part of the Tesco franchise has been amazing, they're forward thinking and rival the prices of Aldi and Lidl, and even better, they use less plastic on fresh produce!!

4. The Zara Martin and Skinny Dip headphones collab was something I was initially excited to hear about, but seeing how flimsy and low quality the headphones were was sad. the quirky headphones would have a real hit if only they were worth the £33 you paid for them.
Something I have noticed popping up more and more frequently these days are food chains collaborating with clothing lines, for example not too long ago their was a Cath Kidston tin of Heinz baked beans. i just don't see the point myself. I have never associated those things together! I would like people to think of my headphones as the comfiest thing you could buy, without compromising on the quality of sound. It would be a reasonably priced pair of headphones, meaning it is more accessible for people on a lower monthly wage who can't afford to splash out on big ticket items and more 'well known' brands. There would be a range of colours and it wouldn't feel bulky or heavy on the head. I would want people to think that the brand stands for comfort without the compromise.",Sonic,
295470,Ayse,Aba,ayseduyguaba@gmail.com,"I realised it's actually difficult to think of an item that makes me 'proud'. I'd say it's probably my Sonos. Every time I have someone in my room, which is quite often because I live in a flatshare, it's always a joy to just connect and listen. And the sound quality is always surprising for someone who's not familiar with the product. The last headphone I purchased was a Sony MDR-V150, basically the cheapest but somehow the coolest looking headphone I could get from an Argos. It was a rushed decision, I'd decided to try to learn to mix and didn't want to upset my flatmates. It's actually quite a bad pair of headphones I had to download an equaliser app on my macbook. I still use them occasionally, especially while working but otherwise I'm usually with my Apple earpods. The price is annoyingly quite a big consideration for me, and I'm somehow happy with the free-for-all earpods. The sound quality is of course, the main reason to buy a new pair, but I also very much care about the tactility. The material and how it feels in my hands play somehow quite a role when I'm buying things. If I wear on ear headphones I tend to get headache after a while as I have quite a big head. And if I'm wearing glasses it's even harder. I never had a wireless headphone, I assume it should be a great comfort. But Apple Airpods look so bad on people it's incredible. If I'd to get a wireless headphone, guess I'd go for a headset. If I'm buying a 'premium' object, I definitely check how it 'feels' in my hands. Material is important for me, and with some objects even the weigh feels so 'on-point' and that's how I get attached to those things. For example I have a very old Kindle and I always thought it was the perfect gadget for its size and ease of use, until I had my hands on a Kindle Fire. The weigh and the material of that product feels just so perfect, it gives me a feeling of wholesomeness.
A 'not premium' service or product would probably be the opposite for me, if it feels bad, if it's leaving me frustrated it's definitely not premium. Again I'd say it's my Sonos. It definitely is telling a story, as I'm constantly listening to music, regardless of what I'm doing. The first thing when I wake up is to play some tunes, as well as the last thing before I sleep. But the 'premium'ness of Sonos is just coming from itself, from the low-key branding, the minimal design and the sound quality. I think B&O headphones look very much premium, for similar reasons — the minimal design and the low key branding. I remember reading an article about the Sony IER-Z1R and thinking, wow listening to music with these should be such an experience. And in Sony's case, the premiumness come from the promise of a unique sound, not from the brand or the design. Yesterday I saw an event that DJ Boring posted on Facebook, which was lucky because I rarely ever check Facebook. It's a gig in April that'll be in Hangar in E8, which is basically around the corner from where I live. I took a screenshot and sent it to a couple of friends, as I've seen him a couple months ago at Phonox and it was great! Here in London, I have a group of friends that I know from back in Turkey. We somehow managed to surround ourselves with people that all have similar political/religious views, so we never have a really heated discussion as we'd have with strangers back in Turkey. Learning to tune out from a frustrating conversation is a skill, and it's easier when done from a 3000 km distance. Internet can be a toxic and a wonderful place at the same time, really depending on how you nurture yourself: some people build up on conflict, I just don't. From a headphones perspective, the B&Os have this really low key nice branding and minimal design. BOSE on the other hand, however good the sound is, feels like missing the point. It's just too much of everything, even the logo BOSE the italic and caps and everything, it's just too 'up there'. I don't even want to start with Beats as I suppose it owns the biggest slice of the cake, but in my mind it'll always look like it's for kids.
A 100% winning brand for me is Maison Kitsuné. The fox logo itself is just so perfect, it's the only logo I guess I wouldn't mind wearing on like a walking advert. And the brand's ties to the music since the mixes and compilations, and then the record label, is just another reason to appreciate the fox. Oh, and also... It's Parisien. – https://maisonkitsune.com/fr_en/
As for collaborations, the Levi's collaboration with the musician Loyle Carner to create a music space in Liverpool looks very promising – and even the teaser video looks so inspiring for the young and I'm excited to see the results. — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWuy5Cl7_4s
A completely different concept and I know it doesn't compare at all, but the Axel Arigato and Cat collaboration is really weird. Axel Arigato and Samsung is even worse. Feels like to me it's just knock off Balenciagas and Off Whites, really not fitting the brand in my opinion. – https://axelarigato.com/uk/men/shoes/arigato-x-cat and https://axelarigato.com/uk/men/shoes/arigato-x-samsung Support creativity and youth! Give back to the community that you take the culture from – that's why the Levi's Music Project looks so inspiring and promising. The problem with some brands is that they always take but never give back. Headphones are expensive. The 'premium' takes a lot from the street culture, surely it could back in different ways.",Sonic,
295471,Joy,Warmann,Joy.warmann@gmail.com,"I'd say the item that I'm most proud of is my electric drum kit. Although, I wouldn't say I was proud of the item itself per se, however playing on it and getting to learn new things with it makes me proud of myself so I guess it's part and parcel. I love drumming and I guess any item that helps me do that makes me very proud. a. I hadn't heard about them before I bought them. I liked that they had a ""bass-booster"" on the sound which suits the majority of the music that I listen to.
b. I decided to buy a new pair of headphones because the sound on my last pair was disappointing and I hated that they were bluetooth and could run out of charge so quickly. 
c. When I shop for earphones I always look for in-ears that are sleek and easy to carry, with a tangle-free chord and a remote control for hands-free phone calls. 
d. Price was a huge consideration. Living in London is not cheap. I'd be willing to pay more for earphones 
e. I narrowed down my choices and then asked one of the store attendants for their recommendations 
f. I bought them about 2-3 months ago for about £20
g. The price and the specs. ai. I prefer over-ear headphones. On-ear feels a bit cumbersome and over-ear cuts off more of the surrounding noise
aii. Wired headphones. Wireless often means you need to charge them and I can't risk my headphones running out of power two or three times in a day. 
aiii. Wireless earphones - not too sure what true wireless buds are but they sound uncomfortable. 

bi. aiaiai
bii. marley (purely for comfort)
biii. beats (for sound quality)
biv. aiaiai
bv. oneplus
bvi. Optoma (have not tried them but I like what they do in the tech world) a. Something that's a cut above the average population. For example, I'd expect an elevated price and a more superior grade of meat if I were to compare McDonalds with Dirty Bones burgers. 

bi. Apple - as frustrating as they are as a brand and a company, they make premium electronics 
bii. the technology and sleekness of design is a cut above your average Nokia or Hauwaii. 

Ci. So I guess the non premium equivalent of apple would be maybe dell. It’s also a technology company that makes similar goods but it’s less sleek and it’s got a lower level of functionality 
Cii. For the reasons listed above but also because it’s the standard slightly average counterpart to apple. I’m not at home but I’ve uploaded a picture.
a. It’s a apple MacBook Air 
B. I’m not sure that it says much about me as a person but one can assume that I’m a freelancer and need a lightweight easy to transport laptop for work. 
C. It makes me super happy when it’s working at such a fast speed. Makes me feel good being able to get through work efficiently. A. Some examples are aiaiai, bose, marshall and beats. They are premium because they offer a higher quality sound, they’re lightweight and comfortable, easy to use and they have a higher level of functionality than most brands 
B. With bose for example I’d prefer the quietcomfort pair to the soundlink. This is because they have superior noise cancellation and more features 
C. There are headphones that can tailor their sound for the listener based on the surround sounds. There are headphones that you can adjust the levels on dependent on the situation you’re using them for. These are premium features. A. Honestly? It was the Cardi B carpool karaoke
B. I saw it on YouTube 
C. It was so exciting because Cardi B is hysterical, such a genuine personality and a damn good rapper. Loved seeing her perform so freely and it made me excited for seeing her at Primavera Festival in Barcelona next year A. If things get heated or passionate in our group we’re often talking about issues of race, politics or poverty (be it breadline poverty or third world) 
B. Because they’re so rife. They’re in our face every single day and around every corner. Being a group with so many different ethnic backgrounds represented and different classes and cultural upbringings it’s something close to our hearts and important for us to discuss and learn from another with. 
C. My opinion in short on these things is that too many people are willfully ignorant on these topics today especially when the information is literally at our fingertips. Racism is everywhere and happens all the time, England has done a great job of doing it somewhat subtly especially when it’s such a big contributor. But microaggessions happen every millisecond. There is a disgusting amount of poverty in this country and in the world and unless the problem affects us directly it’s hard to get people to act or even care about it for long enough. I get my information mostly online but also watch the news on TV. I formed these views by talking and getting it wrong and learning from those who know much more. 
D. Online is your best bet but newspapers and TV help too. 
E. If it was possible to live in a world where everyone was considerate and put others above themselves that would be great. But I’d settle for a world without brexit. 1. Urbanears (as much as it pains me to say it) are doing a great job of branding and advertising their headphones. They’ve made headphones for the modern day millennial and city worker. Stoking their headphones in trendy yet accessible shops like urban outfitters is a great great move. And there is this awful phenomenon surrounding the word urban these days so that works in their favour. 
2. Apple aren’t doing it wrong per se but they aren’t winning the crowd over on their likeablility factor. Their earphones are becoming more of a necessity than a want for people who mainly use apple products yet unfortunately their earphones and AirPods are far more fashion over function. 
3. To mention Cardi B again, in her latest music video for ‘Money’ the beats headphones product placement is clear, prominent and memorable. 
4. I feel like in advertising, sennheiser might have missed the mark because they make amazing headphones but mostly rely on word of mouth for their praises to be sung. I don’t hear about them often via anything else. My favourite pair of headphones is the aiaiai TMA-2. They’re sleek, comfortable and give off a really crisp sound for whatever type of music you’re listening to. The only thing I would change about it is to offer the option to pay for them in instalments. Because they are premium it’s an investment and one that I’m more than willing to make. However it would be nice to have the option to pay for them over time.",Sonic,ESFJ
295464,Eliane,Amend,Amendeliane@gmail.com,"I think the item I am most proud of are two things. One is my piano, the other one is my MacBook. I'm proud of the MacBook as I saved up for ages to scramble more than a grand together (that's a lot for a student...) to afford it, and now I love working on it. 
I am proud of my piano as playing the piano is where I can relax and just chill. Also I write all my music on both my MacBook and my piano. I have a Roland electric piano which I can also connect to my laptop and my producing software.
Can't upload a picture of either as I am back home and not in my flat in London. a. First saw them in John Lewis while Christmas shopping last year. They caught my interest as they are noise cancelling, so I can really tune out. 
b. because my old ones broke after a 10 year service
c. price, brand, quality of sound
d. Price was mainly consideration, but I was prepared to pay more for extraordinary quality and knowing they'll last a long time
e. which is a great place, and my sister is a producer for a record label so she knows a lot and is great with giving recommendations there
f. last Christmas I bought them for about £300 I think...and at John lewis
g. the sound. and I'm a big fan of Bose. they are after bang & olufsen my favourite company a.
i. over ear is my preference. on ear usually has too much pressure on my ear piercings and hurts
ii. Wireless is better, bluetooth means charging and I can't be bothered with that
iii. Wireless earphones, I'd loose the buds in no time

b. 
i. bose/b&o
ii. sennheiser
iii. beats
iv. bose/B&o
v. apple
vi. apple a. highest standard of quality, long lasting, get your moneys worth, and if theres a problem to get a replacement or help immediately
b.
i. brand I'd say the SO hotel group. stayed with them multiple times and it was a great experience every time 
ii. they put a lot of dedication into every detail. they also always put the customer first and theres never a problem or rudeness. even the cleaning staff is absolutely lovely
c. 
i. Ryanair
ii. because even if yes you pay less for a flight you can't expect the highest standard, you can expect at least a little bit of a standard. and every time I've used them I've had problems, delays and their customer service is basically nonexistent and rude I'd say the most premium item I own is my MacBook again. as it's after my piano the most expensive Thing I own
it says about me that I like apple over Microsoft...also kinda shows I work in the creative/media industry
c. I don't know. maybe like I'm a business person getting work done :D a. bose, sennheiser, b&o, because high price but best quality out there
b. yes the noise cancelling ones are more premium as theres more technology to them
c. for some reason wireless ones are. because there is again more technology involved. not a big fan of wireless as you have to charge them a. a song...
b. heard it being played by this busker at Waterloo train station. 
c. because it made me think about the person that I send it to, as we consider it to be ""our song"". 
d.  It's dignity by Deacon Blue. here ya go:  https://youtu.be/-3ueYxrA-Zs a. fashion and other people :D and the usual religion & politics
b. well with politics it is because everybody is kinda pissed off with how the world is ruled by white middle aged men who don't think about anybodys wellbeing or the countries wellbeing but are fine as long as they get paid.
c. I like to look to serious newspapers such as the times & the guardian. 
d. BBC breakfast news 
e. Make any education worldwide for free and accessible for everybody 1. I think as a brand nike is doing well, because they aren't scared to be controversial with their ad campaigns. Also Bose I think is a good brand as their reputation is impeccable and their product is great.
2. In my opinion Beats as they are selling a product that isn't justified for the price. 
3. On the other hand beats did a great collaboration with Balmain. The campaign was well thought out especially having Kylie Jenner modelling it. Through this they secured their positioning even more in the mainstream market. 
4. Back in the 2014 Apple & U2 collaborated which gave everybody who bought a new apple device (iPod/iPhone/Apple Watch/macbook/etc) the Songs of innocence album as an automatic download on their iTunes. What sounds like a great idea turned out wrong as people felt like the music was forced on them. So Apple ended up in a big financial debacle. This missed the mark as about 6.7% of apple customers listened to the album. which means they missed the mark of what most people like listening to.
(I still love U2 and bono tho.) to be fair. I wouldn't change much. I like that my favourite brand isn't the mainstream one, but a bit more on the upper end. Also I think that it's good to have a variety in the market, have some big companies and some independent nice products who might have a higher price point but aren't marketed for the masses and so the attention to detail and sound quality are higher.",Sonic,INTP
295465,Aleksandra,Mielec,olamielec@gmail.com,"I think that of all items in my possession right now I'm probably most proud of the Alexander McQueen jacket I bought quite recently. It had been such a dream to own something McQueen, as the brand has played such an essential role in shaping my style and taste growing up. It's so perfectly tailored - it's got a waist and a shoulder... the moment you put it on it just makes you stand differently. So special! Buying my first 'proper' pair of headphones was a big deal for me, so I remember it so well even though it's been a couple of years! I eventually turned to Sennheiser - I knew I wanted to go for a brand that specialised in headphones specifically and not something like Sony that produces a wide range of electronics. Just like I always buy my shoes from shoe brands and not from stores that do everything from shoes to clothes to accessories!  I'd heard of Sennheiser from my father before so I had kind of been familiar with it. It's also a German brand and the Germans tend to be pretty serious about quality :) and I knew I wanted the very best if I was going to spend a considerable amount of money. After doing some online research I went to Berlin to one of the biggest electronics stores in the city to check out all the different options - when it comes to something like headphones I wouldn't just trust online reviews - I had to hear it for myself! I spent ages in the store testing all the different models and finally decided on the HD 558 headphones. I don't mind they have a really long, thick wire and need a massive adapter, as I only use them at home when I really want to get the most of whatever I'm listening to! They are super comfy and don't get painful on my ears even after a couple of hours! I think I bought them for around 150 euros but price was secondary consideration to me. Quality of sound and comfort is what I value most about headphones and I totally don't mind spending a bit more of something that is going to serve me well for years. 

However, when it comes to headphones I wear when I'm out and about no wire is a massive plus. I currently own a pair of Beats by dr Dre simply because I got them for free when I got my Mac. I can't say I'm unhappy with them but they're pretty expensive for what they are and I 100% wouldn't have bought had I had to pay the full price - the quality of sound is not too great and they're quite uncomfy! However, I appreciate how they isolate the external noises, which is essential when using them in a busy environment and I love that they're wireless! I always use them when I'm travelling. They're also quite pretty, and although it's not a factor that would influence my choice of headphones, it's just nice they're so smart and go well with outfits.

So to sum up I'd say the top three things I look for in headphones are: 1. quality of sound 2. comfort 3. handiness (no wire!) a) It depends on what I'm using the headphones for. Like I mentioned before when I'm using them at home, which I do a lot, I don't mind a big wire because it usually translates into much better quality of sound. I generally prefer over-ear headphones because of that reason too. However, I do hate the wire when I'm out and about so no wire is a big plus when I'm travelling etc. I only use in-ear headphones when I don't want to carry the big ones and i just want to pop them into a pocket after I'm done. I I've never used wireless buds, so I don't have an opinion!

b) I'm not too good with headphones brands to be honest so in most cases my answer will be limited to the only brand I know does the kind of headphones. I'm generally a fan of Bose and Sennheiser, so I'd say they win in all categories! a) I would normally expect something 'exclusive' or 'beyond average' from something labelled 'premium'
b) I think in a way any luxury designer brand is premium because of the quality and exclusivity of goods as well as the customer service that aims to make the customer experience as enjoyable as possible
c) Any high-street brand like H&M or Zara is not premium - it's cheap, poor quality and easily accessible I'm gonna repeat myself but it's definitely the Alexander McQueen jacket. It's just so beautifully made, the fit is perfect - it just makes you feel so confident when you wear it because it's so well-tailored. It's a statement in itself. It's not something you'd wear just anywhere. The quality of the fabric is incredible. You can tell by just looking at it that it's a special piece, you don't even need to see the label. I think when it comes to headphones all brands that supply for professionals are premium. You can be sure that if an artist uses it in the studio it's probably decent quality and can be considered 'premium'! I think it's the general quality that makes them 'premium' more than anything. I'm pretty sure the last thing that got me super excited was the latest Sziget festival line-up announcement that I saw on Facebook! Me and my mates can't wait for the festival season and monitor all line up announcements to choose this year's best options! There's nothing I look more forward to than festivals and there's nothing better than seeing the bands you love in love acts! They're having Florence and Foo Fighters this year! It's always the politics that heats things up just because we all feel so strongly about it. It hits so close to home on so many levels nowadays. We just feel hopeless standing there not being able to influence the course of events in any way. It's devastating to see the world heading so far right and its leaders disrespecting our values. 
I read news from multiple sources, left to middle to right just to get a balanced perspective. It's usually the Financial Times, The Telegraph, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian etc as well as national newspapers from Poland and Germany. 
As cliche as it sounds all I want for the world right now is peace just because the possible consequences of what's been going on are so terrifying and we do not want the history to keep repeating itself over and over until there's nothing left to fight for. 1) I think the brands that are getting it right have managed to appeal to and engage their audiences on many different levels. Gucci is a perfect example - what gotten so right is how brilliantly they translate the creative narrative. Everything they do is so well thought-through and executed. It's the transmediary narrative. They bombard you with those images through all kinds of different media which then add up in your head to create an idea of what that brand is. If you think about it, you’ve probably seen Gucci pretty much everywhere –in print, on posters and billboards all over the city, the campaigns are across all social and traditional media, they do short-films, they do parties, they even have a museum in Florence, they’re produce so much diverse content. They never do anything the easy way, it’s all always packed with meaning, there’s some kind of dreamy story behind it. They wouldn’t just do a lookbook – they’d put models on an ancient ship and there’d be mermaids involved and everything. They invite everyone to this big, beautiful world of fantasy that they built from all those cultural references and inspirations coming from so many different places. 
I'm not really up to date with headphone brands, so it's pretty hard to say. Beats by Dr Dre do some good marketing - I myself got a pair for free when I bought my Mac which was nice! But that I do own a pair and would not buy them again just because I think they're overpriced and overhyped. 

2) I'm sorry for just sticking to fashion but a great example of a brand that's getting it very wrong is Victoria's Secret, that's been producing those very same oversexualised shows for years, casting the same Barbie-style models and been generally deaf to what's been going on in the world with the entire Time Is Up and Me Too movement! I can't think of a brand that's more out of touch. They just refuse to respond to the times and the changing attitudes. The world has changed, VS has not, which will probably soon result in the brand being ostracised. 
Again with headphone brands, I'm just unaware of what's been going on in the industry, haven't seen a headphone ad in forever!

3) Again, Gucci is doing such a fantastic choice with its choice of collaborators! They tap everyone from musicians and actors to artists and content creators. It's gotten to a point when everyone is 'gucci', from ASAP Rocky to Courtney Love to Lana del Rey and I think it has given the brand so much depth. 
Again with headphones - no idea! Sorry :( I think the easiest way to get to my heart is through the musicians I respect. Headphones are all about music and music always provides such an excellent opportunity to build an emotional connection with people. A collaboration would definitely draw my attention. As long as it feel authentic and does not scream 'paid for content' I think it would work for me! Maybe they could do something a bit more creative like 'in the studio with XYZ..' featuring bands talking about their recording process and showing us around the studio. Or perhaps some behind the scenes content from a tour? I think providing the audience with content featuring artists they care about would be a great way of establishing a more meaningful, long-lasting relationship!",Sonic,
295466,Ioana,Lupascu,ioana.slupascu@gmail.com,"I took a long break from shooting on film. It wasn't intentional, I think it just happened. After a year or so, I got out my camera and realised it was still a bit broken. I never got around to fixing it, maybe that is why the pause extended for so long. 

An opportunity to travel was coming up, I was about to spend a week in a remote inland Portuguese town. Two days before getting the flight I decide to get a new camera, a fresh start, an item with no personal history and actually fully functional. A day later I picked it up from the postoffice, a Vivitar V3000 with a 50mm lens. It's not an exceptional camera by no means, middle range, affordable and quick to dispatch, but it was exactly what I needed. No strings attached. I had no idea whether it will work or if the photos are going to be what I  want them to be, I had no prior experience with this brand. Popped a fuji 200 iso film in and hopped for the best. 

Three films later and back from my trip, I am shuffling through the photos I took. The camera exceeded my expectation! 

I am proud of it because it allowed me to come back to photography and enjoy it again. Every time I pick it up, I think of new beginnings and I get excited about the upcoming adventure I am about to shoot. It’s the feeling it raises inside of me, but also, it’s just a really cool, minimal, sturdy camera. How/Where did you first hear about them? What was it that caught your attention and interest?	
I first saw them on a good friend. He had around his neck all the time and used them a lot for film editing. The headphones seemed slick and simple. They also looked very comfortable and, had a very cool feature, a jack on each side. 	
	
Why did you decide to buy a new pair of headphones?	
I had an affordable pair of headphones that I lost. I was quite happy with them, but at the time I was not paying too much attention to the quality of the sound. Although I mostly use earbuds for roaming around, I wanted to get a proper pair of headphone that I would have long term and had a great sound quality. 	
	
What were your considerations when deciding what headphones to buy?	
The quality of the sound and a minimal design were top priorities. I enjoy simple designs that don’t stand out too much and headphones that are tuned to variety of genders of music. So I chose a pair that is not too base heavy, as I like variety in music.
	
How much was price a consideration? What features would you be willing to pay more for?  	
I knew I wanted to invest in a good quality pair of headphones that were ideally produced in Europe so I had a decent budget. 
I’m happy to pay more to have the microphone included. Maybe bluetooth too, when I got mine, B&O bluetooth one were still too big for my taste. 
	
Where did you look for/get information to help you make the decision?
There wasn’t a specific website I looked at. I read a few online reviews and watched youtube videos about them, asked my friend for an opinion and also, I had already used them in the past and knew I like them. 	
I didn’t spend too much time on the brand website as I was looking for a more low-brow review. 
	
Where and when did you buy these? How much did you pay?	
I managed to find them on Ebay for a good price at the time, £180.
	
What ultimately sold you on these headphones?	
It feels like a very considerate design with a minimal aesthetic. The sound is great and not aimed at high volumes, but fine details. What is your preference on the following? Please explain why you prefer one over the other:

on-ear headphones as they are generally lighter and smaller in size. 

wired headphones so far, I think mostly out of habit. Also, I enjoy that they tend to be smaller in size.

True wireless buds would be my choice if I switched to wireless. There is little sense in the cable for me, it feels like a half decision. 


What brand and model do you think wins in each of these sub-categories?

Over-ear headphones
AIAIAI - they are modular so you can play around with model. 

On-ear headphones
B&O When I choose a premium service, I generally expect a higher quality or standard that expands beyond the product itself and explores both sustainability issues and social economical awareness. There is also a certain easy of use and intuitive understanding of the product that is expected. A seamless integration into my daily routine. 

A while ago I switched to an organic food home delivery service that comes in environmentally conscious packaging. It ticks most of the social-economical boxes that are important to me as a consumer, and also pays incredible attention to the small details. 

Able and Cole is a local company that both supports and collaborates with other small businesses to provide high quality, sustainably sourced products. The website user experience is well design and the price still fits within my budget. They provide more that just food, but the range on offer is well curated and they tend to choose other brands that have a similar business manifesto. 


As for a not premium experience ,I would definitely include shopping at low cost stores similar to Primark. The stores are loud, bright and always crowded, and promote an irresponsible from of consumerism. It’s focused on quantity over quality and short life of a product. Probably one of the most premium thing I own is my B&O H6 headphones. I bought the pair about two years ago when I decided I wanted to change the way I consume. If before I was less concerned with high quality due to it general high price, and justifying as too expensive for what I can afford I now see it as an investment. I am incredibly happy with the purchase and I enjoy taking care of them, as somehow I associate the premium nature with a certain level of care. 

I'd like to think it's a statement on respect for well crafted product design and an appreciation for the quality of sound. 

The experience differs on whether I am using the headphone out on a walk or indoor. When I take them along on my city explorations there is a sense of the city sounds and the music I am listening to creating their own unique symphony. The volume doesn't go too loud to some of the background noises trickle in, making me aware of my surroundings. As I normally take these particular headphones when I also take my film camera, those little sounds from the outside that add to my music make me pay attention to different aspects of the city. Whether it looking up at corners of buildings or down at floor textures, it's an invitation to explore what I see and capture it on camera. 

When I use them at home, I tend to listen to ambient music, artists similar to Alva Noto. I daydream and try to cut out from the background noise. I'm looking to disconnect from the world around and just enjoying the musical moment. In my research I have come across a number of brands that would fall under this category. But from my own personal experience and my own brand choices, I think B&O and AIAIAI stand out. Then both fit within an affordable budget and a good ratio of quality to price. 

Both brands have a particular attention to detail, form and function. Although they target different audiences, they would definitely be at the top of my recommendations. 

What I like about both of these brands approach is that they don't have a big range of products. Every now and again there is an updated model with better sounds sensitivity and new technology but the focus is one solid option.

B&O does only one model at it's core, in wireless and wired and the buds option. There is not low-cost or higher cost option. It almost feels like there is little compromise of the sound quality. As for AIAIAIA, what I enjoy the most is the modular philosophy of the brand, and how it is possible to tailor the design to exactly what you intend to use the headphone for. 

I like how with AIAIAI I can choose each part and put it together myself, there is a sense of ownership in that and also an educational experience. To choose, I have to understand what each part does and what it adds to the final design. Configuring the design feel like a premium experience in which I am encouraged to play and experiment and make a conscious decision of the design. 

The buyer experience, the branding and the general feel of AIAIAI is incredible and very well done. Well, generally that is books, I get overly excited about a good read every other week and good tv screenplays. But I'd like to write about this new toilet paper brand that I am now in love with. It's called 'Who Gives a Crap' - brilliant name right?

It's an Australian crowd funded startup that aims to make a difference by donations 50% of their profits (from selling sustainable toilet paper) to help charities build toilets and improve sanitation in the developing world. I first heard about it from a friend, I didn't get it from the start, from a glance it just looked like expensive toilet paper with great wrapping. As soon as I read more about it, I got hooked and became a big supporter. There is just a great mix of humour, honest intentions and taking on a stand by how making a difference can come from small changes in out daily lives.

It's easy to order, it looks great, it comes wrapped in sustainable packaging and uses some great puns. Plus, apart from being from recycled paper, it had an option for bamboo toilet rolls which is more sustainable that using trees.

I'm a fan, what can I say :) Once we have past the general catching up phase of any get together, it really depends of the group of friends. The topics can range from developing one's self awareness and emotional intelligence to politics of immigration and current design trends and sustainable practices. Probably the topics that do sometimes make the discussion heated are politics of gender and race and ways to be sustainable. There is though an ingrained respect for each others opinions, when in conversations with close friends, so the issues tend be explored in depth without much need for unhealthy debate. 

These are topics that we have to deal with, and experience on a daily bases. It feels like there is much more space to voice ones opinions now, online and offline. A lot of the times there is a perception that these opinions, once stated are also final. When in reality, as you learn more about a subject an opinion can develop as well. The very current nature of a binary form or self expression creates a lot of unnecessary debate. I personally value much more an in depth conversation where I can exercise my creative and critical thinking without pursuing a conclusion or debating ones already establish opinion. Presenting a personal truth has the potential to be presented as a universal truth which is where I find most conversations become personal statements and not open discussion. 

As I have previously mentioned, I like to keep a certain open mindedness when it comes to expressing my opinions. As I learn and listen, I like challenging my opinions and ask questions instead. There are principles I hold on to that have a strong impact on how I form an opinion. I find that minimalism as a way of thinking fits well with my current beliefs. I try to listen first, think critically and state less what I personally think. 

I get a lot of information from selective newsletters, podcasts mainly, conversations and independent journalism. The idea of being on top of what is going on in the world feel too overwhelming right now, there is an overflow of information and little trust in the sources. I choose my information 'battle' and try to responsibly inform myself on a number of curated subjects. I mostly gravitate towards topics of sustainability, art and design, and culture. They give me an indication of related fields and I try to surround myself with people that know more on the subject I am less passionate about.

There and many things I would like be improved, and the one that I am very interested in now is education. The foundation of our way of thinking lie a lot in our education. By investing in the base layer we can improve future outcomes. It was less immediately visible results but it has a great long term impact. Monzo is doing an amazing job and pushing banking user experience to a new level, they definitely improved the status quo in the field. Great app, amazing costumer service, it feels like an approachable start-up that is figuring out as they go along, and are transparent about it, which feels like quite a refreshing attitude. 

In terms of headphones, I'd definitely put AIAIAI on top of my list. The modular nature of the design, attention to detail and the minimalist mentality make them a favorite for me. 

I think fast fashion is getting it wrong for sure, and there are many brands that can fit under this notion, Primark, H&M, Zara. They all promote completely unsustainable approach to shopping and seem to have little regard to long term effects of their business model. There isn't a particular model that comes to mind, but I often think of airplane headphones and how now in my mind I associate them with single use plastic.

Gopro and Red Bull, when skydiver Felix Baumgartner jumped from 128,000 feet above Earth, breaking the speed of sound in an epic freefall. Both brands got great exposure and they seemed to merge a common audience, and show what the manifesto of the brands it, pushing the limits. 

I'm not too aware of headphone brands collaborations but I do remember the artist section on AIAIAI. I quite liked browsing through the artist section, finding the artist I like and seeing the headphones the chose for their music style and performances. 

Apple and the famous U2 album download created quite some tension. I guess in a way Apple did get a lot of exposure, still not quite sure whether that was a hidden intention. Music has become a strong expression of individual tastes that, a brand imposing taste feel very intrusive. 

Beats celebrity collaborations might be doing it right for a particular target, but for me it just seems a little fake and too in my face. As a result, I have never been too keen to look into their other aspects, like sound quality or craftsmanship. CEO at AIAIAI, that is a tough one as I think they are doing an amazing job already. I quite like that they specialise in headphones for musicians and I can't say I would like them to expand into a more diverse range of musical styles. Although I don't personally own one, I do rave a lot about the brand itself. 

The one thing, educate buyers and non-buyer about the importance of responsible consumption. And by doing that have an honest conversation out current socio-economical issues and how important a sustainable approach is in our current times. Things like finding ways to use less natural resources and switch to recycled, reuse.",Sonic,ENFP
295467,Ged ,Caroll,gedcarroll@mac.com,"I used to scuba dive; I found this watch on the last dive that I did. It was on a ledge of a flooded slate quarry in North Wales at a depth of 50m. Nowadays dive organisations like BSAC and PADI do their damnest to stop you diving on air that deep. I was young and didn't care, my dive buddies were go deeper junkies. If you know diving we were working off original BSAC88 tables to plan our dives. I was following a ledge carved into the side of the quarry, staying out of the way of rusting machinery and cars that had been left in the quarry when it filled up decades before. The water isn't as clear as tropical dive sites, but its good for the cold water of the UK because so little life existed in the quarry. My torch beam hit the face of the watch which glinted so I picked it up and put it in my pocket to look at it on the surface. Something suddenly hits me, my buddy who I was diving with lost his weight belt. It had come undone we still aren't sure how. He grabbed hold of me and both of were taking off fast. He managed to get a carabiner on me and I dumped air out of my dry suit and his dry suit as fast. I was breathing out as hard as I could and it still felt like I was breathing in. We went 35 metres in what seemed like seconds before stopping on a guideline at 15m and sitting there until our air ran out to try and compensate for too rapid a decompression.  I was ok apart from blotches my torso being covered in burst blood vessels in my skin. 

The watch has two lessons for me. 
1/ All my work needs to be commercial unlike Porsche's design
2/ Always keep an eye on what really matters I used to DJ seriously and from that I had a huge amount of trust in Sennheiser as a brand. My go to set of headphones at the time where a HD-25s that were bullet proof. My mates Dad worked on sound for Mersey Television at the time they were shooting Brookside -  soap opera that used a lot of 'outside broadcast' work as well as studio time for post production of audio.  He recommended the HD-25s to me and I bought them through a music instrument shop in Liverpool who had to put them on special order. 

Some friends of mine were spending a lot of time at night in a studio producing music and I got to hang out there. They were using a pair of open back headphones when they programmed the MIDI instruments and closed back headphones for mixing down vocals and live instruments. I noticed that the open headphones didn't keep sound out but had 'space' which my HD-25s didn't have. One evening one of the guys brings in a pair of HD-250s which had the space of open air headphones but the noise reduction of the HD-25s. 

I eventually managed to get a pair when I moved down to London from Studiospares in Camden, but these where the next model on the Sennheiser HD-250 Linear II and they've been my favourite home listening headphones ever since. They're made in Germany and feel very light on the head. The headband never feels hot or sweaty yet they keep the noise out and the sound in. Sennheiser no longer makes them unfortunately. What is your preference on the following? Please explain why you prefer one over the other:
Over-ear vs. on-ear headphones - Over the ear for serious listening. I tend to wear on ear headphones (Sennheiser's HD-25s because they are ideal for moving around and travelling with. My Sennheiser HD-250 which are over the ear are too bulky for travel. A lot of over the ear headphones can be sweaty when you wear them for half a day or so. 
Wireless vs. wired headphones - I have both. Wireless convenience is great BUT and its a big issue for me. The sound on Bluetooth isn't as good as a set of wired headphones. Also wired headphones don't lose charge (unless they're noise cancelling.) My Bose QC-25 can still play music even if the battery is dead on the noise cancellation. 
Wireless earphones vs. true wireless buds  - I haven't bought wireless buds because their battery life is much lower than wireless earphones, although I can understand the freedom that they give 

What brand and model do you think wins in each of these sub-categories?
Over-ear headphones - Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro would be my personal recommendation. If you want an open back set of headphones then all the big brands like Sennheiser, AKG, Master and Dynamic and Hi-FiMan have good products
On-ear headphones - non active noise cancelling Sennheiser's HD-25 are the headphone to beat. Noise cancelling Bose's QC 25 and 35 headphones would be my recommendation though the QC-35 had Bluetooth for wireless use
Wireless headphones - Bowers & Wilkins PX get a lot of good reviews, but I'd still go with Bose. Their design isn't as showy as B&W, It's easy to get replacement pads and their noise cancellation is so good, its a pity Bose can't work a little harder to make the headband feel less cheap
Wired headphones - It depends on what you want from a sound perspective and if you want noise cancellation. But you can't go too far wrong with Sennheiser's HD 25 II
Wireless earphones I have a Bose Soundsport wireless earphones which get the job done. There are so many players in this category that I don't think that there is a clear winner. It really depends what you need
True wireless buds Apple's AirPods has got mind share just like their classic white iPod headphones from back in the day. For me the Jabra Elite 65t edge it on quality / price balance and are a bit more understated if you go for the titanium finish ones If you buy something ‘premium’, what is your expectation of that product / service?
Premium isn't necessarily just about materials, which is one of the key mistakes that people like Huawei make all the time. Materials and good design are just the start. 
It is about a product or service meeting your expectation and then you seeing a greater deal of thoughtfulness and foresight behind it. I have used a Mac for almost 30 years despite their up and downs because the software consistently does that. I prefer to fly Cathay Pacific because their lounges, staff and aircraft show this level of thoughtfulness and foresight. 

Think of a product / service / brand or experience that you consider to be premium.
Tell us about it. I'll take it back to headphones for a minute. Lots of companies design great headphones. Sony, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, Bose. They are designing for different market segments. 

What separates Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser apart historically has been their thinking about the total life of the product. The headphones were designed to be user serviceable. You could remove the headphone cord and replace it. You could replace the ear pads or the head band. Sony had headphones that were well made like the MDR-7506. They sounded amazing. But the ear pads started to shed flakes of pleather after a few years. You had to take them apart to replace the cord. Until Chinese companies found eBay it was hard to buy spare parts for them. Sony is really bad at after parts service for design classic products. 

Why do you think this is premium?

The depth of thought that Sennheiser and Beyerdynamic put into products and how they would function for their life with the customer. Good design and high function isn't enough to make a premium product, it's being able to do what you need to do. Knowing that if you're changing the cord an engineer has already thought about how to make it easy for you, rather than just how easy is it to manufacture the device. It is knowing that you will be able to get replacement parts for your well loved 10 year old headset. 

What about a product / service / brand or experience that is not premium, in your opinion?

Non-premium is about being short sighted in comparison to a premium product. It's about the now, changing to meet market conditions rather than maintaining standards. Its about not considering the product or customer life. It's about hygiene or disappointment. A good example of a brand that is non-premium in my opinion is Huawei. 

Tell us about it.

Huawei make smartphones, they have wanted to replace the likes of Samsung and Apple. Over the past five years they have turned out phones with a good industrial design and use of premium materials like Apple and Samsung. The problem has been everything else. I went into a Huawei branded store in Hong Kong to look their premium 'P-series' handset. They had a number of black boxes that looked like premium watch boxes and the Huawei logo was embossed on the top in silver foil. 

I asked if I could try a handset and was told I could only try one if I bought it. They weren't allowed to open the box and they had no demonstration handsets in store. I eventually found another store where I could try a handset. It had its own skin on Android that provided a unique look and feel on the home screen. Once you opened an app however you realised how inconsistent the experience was. Differentiated yes, but thought through -  not at all and that was Huawei's own apps not third party apps like WeChat or Facebook. 

Why is this not premium?  

Huawei obviously thought about premium only in terms of surface things, rather than demonstrating farsighted thoughtfulness providing an integrated software experience, or demonstration models inshore. This is a 20 year old Rolex Sea-Dweller. The watch is only the part of what you buy. Behind the watch is a global service network to keep your watch running perfectly. The Sea-Dweller is an exceptionally reliable dive watch. It just works. It is perfectly balanced in terms of information versus ease of use and comfort.

Given the amount of fakes around now, I don't think that it says much about me as a person. 

I just like having something that I can rely upon. I don't think of it as luxury per se but as hard wearing like a Mystery Ranch back pack or a Carhartt chore coat. A: In terms of premium pricing - B&O, B&W, Beats, V Moda, Master & Dynamic, HifiMan, Fostex, AKG, Bose
In terms of premium product - B&O, B&W,  Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, Master & Dynamic, Grado
Why are they premium: quality of sound (though with V Moda, Beats and new AKGs I would take issue with that, hence my split in premium pricing and products. Materials: B&O, B&W and Master and Dynamic all use real leather in their ear pads. Product design: Master & Dynamic nail this with their diesel punk aesthetic, its also a huge reason to buy B&O and B&W. Made in DACH & EU countries or the US: audio is a mature technology but it relies on a lot of knowhow built up over years, whilst Shenzhen is the workshop of the world you don't want to see made in China on your headphones as they don't have that history. Fostex build their premium headphones in Japan using traditional craft and skill. This is where some Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic and Grado handsets have an edge. Features: in the past AKG experimented with multiple drivers in a headphone rather like a speaker, now the big technology is active noise reduction and Bose are the biggest technologists in the space. 
B: The holy grail of headphones for me is the Sony MDR-R10 - it's got it all: premium materials, new technology (special bio cellulose formed drivers) and amazing sound quality. I got to listen to a pair at a hifi show once and you could see how impressive open and spacious the sound was
B&O H9i - as much a headphone to be seen wearing as listen to. Its natural leather coloured head band and pads match designer handbags. 
B&W P5W wireless - pretty similar reasons for the H9i
Sennheiser HD - 25 - it is all about the sound, the build quality and the user centric design. These are made in Europe by Sennheiser
Grado GH2 - all about the sound. They look like they should come with a Walkman, they are so 80s but the open design and sound quality is great hifi
Grado x Bushmills - rare as hens teeth limited edition headphones. The real reason why you want theses isn't the BS about the Bushmills cask wood, but that Grado made a closed back headphone. They haven't done this before or since
Sennheiser's Orpheus is a matching set of open back headphones and amplifier for football player money - amazing sound and a definite statement set of headphones
Beyerdynamic's Tesla range: new technology in the driver units, great sound in each category of headphone, classic Beyerdynamic shape, very well made in Germany. The T5P would be on my shopping list if I get a refund from the taxman
C/ For people who aren't audio fans: BlueTooth would be a factor because of its convenience, the problem is that BlueTooth as an audio standard isn't great, possibly compatibility with Google Voice, Alexa or Siri - I think that this is vendor rather than customer driven however. Active noise cancelling is a compromise between fidelity and noise reduction but Bose are getting better each model. Design and materials for fashionistas. If you really care about audio design is again important, quality of the cabling, the driver units, earpad materials velour (rather than pleather) or leather. Flexibility of connection XLR for balanced inputs, jacks. Third parties do great lightning cables for many of the headphone brands A/ Hajime Sorayama's collaboration with Christian Dior men's range (with the amazing Kim Jones and the gorgeous talented Yoon from Ambush - I rate Ambush and Acronym better than Off White)
B/ Not sure if I saw it on the usual blogs (Complex, High Snoberity, HypeBeast) or Instagram first
C/ Sorayama-san is a fucking genius, he is up there with Syd Mead for me in terms of design futurism. People think of him as the chrome pin-up guy, which he is but his work is so much more. Sorayama-san and Mead paint the future worlds that we were promised as children, not the world of Tinder, Facebook and zero hour contracts. The Dior deal gives him a much bigger canvas than the previous projects with Nike (which ended up just curating his designs) or Samsung Fashion - that seemed to be an ego-boost for the CEO's youngest daughter. A/ It depends on the group of friends. From friends in the same line of work (strategy and planning for creative and ad agencies) its about efficiency, effectiveness the role of brand versus performance. Amongst my Irish compatriots Brexit and the Irish housing bubble are the main topics of conversation. My art and design friends talk about the latest hype items, why Supreme is passe, why Frieze is no longer any good and what we're currently listening to or looking at. Books come up a lot of discussion as do project ideas. 
B/ A big part of it is how it affects our lives. Advertising and creative marketing is being disrupted by accountant-minded consultancies like Accenture that have become popular. Clients have been in-housing the production of marketing assets, they deny the role that they have in culture. The very thing that made Hoover or Google a verb in British English. They are all about the short term. You could say a similar thing about Brexit. The more art and design discussions are more future focused; about possibilities and flaws that need to be fixed. The itch that needs scratching. Books come up a lot as they are the sources of ideas that fuel the engine of creation. 
C/ Christ, good question. Efficiency, effectiveness and brand marketing is one of balance rather than extremes. Technology made the pendulum swing too far and it is starting to swing back with the mistrust in digital platforms. Before Facebook's privacy issues there has been blatant advertising fraud and mis-reporting of results across all the ad platforms. I came to this opinion by reading around the main tomes, experience, research papers and good discussions on private forums, events and in person with friends who are peers. In terms of Brexit; self interest dictates that isn't a great thing. Although whether its preventable is quite another matter. Brexit was at least 30 years in the making as Britain went post-industrial whilst still having an industrial workforce little use for anything else. Populism and economic stagnation go together like blueberries and pancakes - you can see it rippling out from the Arab spring to Brexit, the AFD in Germany and even the Chinese Communist Party's pivot to Han nationalism. In terms of Supreme being passe; the brand is a one trick joke on consumerism that has become a parody of itself. People like Ambush, Acronym, Fragment, Neighborhood and Off-White have done more to move streetwear forward. Frieze is essentially a commercial vehicle there is a tension between commerce and the new, new thing - its there for the benefit of dealers. Things that I am currently reading - revisiting Kevin Kelly's works, Neil Gaiman's American Gods and about 1000 RSS feeds through newsblur. I am a big fan of VisualPolitik on YouTube, read the FT, Monocle, Wired (US edition) and Irish Times in print. 
D/ My first point of call is my RSS reader which I have feeds from about 1000 sites. I use Newsblur as it learns what I am interested in through training so tailors my reading material somewhat. I still believe in a newspaper - the FT in print, I have a subscription to the US edition of Wired magazine - occasionally they still push the envelope on graphic design. I still buy magazines and foreign newspapers when I can: The Irish Times, Monocle, Harpers magazine (US), HailMary magazine (Japan) and Milk magazine (Hong Kong). 
E/ To be honest, at the moment it would be to fatten my bank account. Many of the challenges in the world are multi-variant, they would take money and time to solve all the underlying causes. I could also do with the cash, but then couldn't we all? 1/ Brands that are getting it right are living the story and showing it rather than focusing on practicing brand storytelling. Brands who focus on making 'heirloom' products that will last. Great examples include:
- Arc'teryx - who unlike North Face haven't gone hard into fashion and kept things technical
- Acronym - no fucks given, just good (expensive) uncompromising products, I love their systems approach to design in their bags borrowing from MOLLE
- Addison Lee - they don't get the love that Uber does but they are still rock solid reliable
- BEAMS who nail it from a constant curation point of view
- Beyerdynamic - probably more so than Sennheiser (which has a lot of faddy Made in China headphones in its lower priced range) demonstrated everyday solid German audio engineering 
- Bluenote Records
- US version of Carhartt - who just make burly gear and let the market sort out its popularity
- La Sportiva and Dolomite who do some of the nicest 'European' looking alpine walking boots
- Mystery Ranch and Gregory who do a similar thing in bags, particularly in their Japanese market specific stuff. 
 - Loewe TVs - rock solid made in Germany quality with great components and don't go overboard on 'smart' features leaving that to outboard devices like Apple's TV, Amazon Fire stick, TiVo and Roku
- Neighborhood and Visivim who consistently turn out quality product
- OPPO blu-ray players. Until they withdrew from the market this year, OPPO where a living oxymoron - a top quality Chinese brand. Along with Beijing Tong Ren Tang one of the few Chinese brands to nail quality and consistency
- Panerai - they make a lot of mistakes, particularly in some of the new innovative materials that they've used which seem to cause customer issues, but they are a passionate community orientated brand
- Rolex - let the product do the talking, though deliberate under-supply and dealer shenanigans are fucking a lot of customers off
- Red Wing and Blundstone boots
- Randolph Engineering - I am a huge fan of their collaboration with Michael Bastian that along with vintage Oakley and B&L era Ray-Bans are my go to pair of sunglasses
- Stussy - who have stuck to the spirit of what Shawn Stussy kicked off. I was gutted when Shawn's S-Double clothing range folded
2/ Brands that are getting it wrong
 - It hurts me to say this but Apple. They think of themselves as a luxury brand rather than a quality brand and it shows in them withdrawing from certain categories like desktop displays and wifi hubs, their lack of support for pro products, design misfires like the wireless charger for iPhone, AirPods and Watch which failed to launch, MacBook and MacBook Pro. They still have compelling products but I've not seen a line up this bad from them in 20 years
 - Huawei and Samsung - premium materials and denegating the competition rather than emphasising their own strengths doesn't make premium handsets. The problem is the Android / Qualcomm eco-system which focuses handset manufacturers on process innovation over product innovation
 - Beats - they have a story, but they aren't hi-fidelity headphones which they should be at the price. Then there is the dishonest product design with weights in the headband to make it feel 'more solid'
 - New Balance - I wear New Balance but its older models with premium materials, the newer products feel cheap and don't live up to the brand promise
 - North Face - probably focusing too much on the street with weak and cheap products: some of the Mountain Parka remakes looked like fakes, rather than sticking with design classics and technical wear. Saying that I still love my North Face Himalayas parka for when the weather is truly dreadful
 - Supreme - I realise that sellout is a get-x specific insult and doesn't mean a lot in the culture of 'everyone wants to be an influencer / celebrity' but Supreme feels to me like its jumped the shark. The antics of Supreme Italy aren't helping things either My favourite set of headphones is Sennheiser's HD-250 Linear II. They are made in a modernistic design language that hasn't aged at all, yet Sennheiser has abandoned to follow the more fad driven designs from the far east in its lower end headphones. I'd advise him to prune the current range, keep classics like the HD-25 bring back classic ageless designs like the HD 414, the 480. Here's something I wrote about the Sennheiser HD-250 Linear II and why I love them http://renaissancechambara.jp/2011/05/22/throwback-gadget-sennheiser-hd250-ii-linear-headphones/.  The product will be a substantial part of the marketing - its not like they do that much marketing anyway",Sonic,
234999,Frances,Lea,franceslea@live.co.uk,"I am most proud of my acoustic guitar. It is a second hand Martin and it plays beautifully and looks great. But the reason I love it so much is because it represents a bond between me and my dad. When I got back from travelling at the age of 19 I was desperate to learn the guitar...because all the cool people I had met could play it! I had grown up with my dad playing guitar at home most days and he has even made a few too. I told my dad I wanted to learn and he said I could borrow his tiny red electric guitar...which was really quite horrible! BUT. He said if I could learn enough on that one to show I was serious about wanting to play then I could think about getting a proper one. I spent hours practicing on this red triangular guitar, without an amp, hearing the tinny sound of the strings as I strummed. After about a year of learning chords and rhythms and starting to write my own songs, my dad saw that this was something I really wanted to do. He then searched through all of the second hand guitar shops in London looking for something I could play. And he landed on my Martin. The perfect size and sound. It even has a little cigarette burn on the neck to boast it’s previous life. Since I started learning the guitar, my dad and I have become closer and sometimes we play together. He sends me songs he has written and comes to my gigs and comments on my guitar playing! I hope one day that he will make me a guitar. I was looking for a great pair of headphones to use in my home studio, for recording and editing songs. The most important thing was sound quality and I was sure I wanted over ear headphones too. I needed to be able to immerse myself in the act of making music. 

My brother is a professional musician and my dad is pretty knowledgable on musical equipment so I asked them for advice. They both recommended Sennheiser as a brand known for good sound quality.

I was very lucky that my birthday was coming up and my brother and my dad bought the headphones for me, so I’m not sure how much they were at the time. You can get them on eBay for about £60 now and I’ve had these a good few years, maybe 5. They do a great job and I’m happy with them so I’ve had no need to replace them!

If I was buying a new pair I would definitely consider something cordless as I’m constantly getting tangled up in the cord to my phones. But I always worry that I’d forget to charge the headphones up, which is why I’ve stuck with cords so far. I’d also like something less bulky, something that maybe folds up and fits in a bag easier.

There’s a great feature on someone earphones where they monitor your heartbeat which I think is a really cool feature for when you’re exercising. 

And it’s always nice if they look good! I wasn’t too bothered about the look of my HD205’s because I knew I’d be wearing them mostly at home. But for phones I want to take out and about, the design is definitely an important feature. I prefer over ear headphones as the on ear ones can get a bit sore if you wear them for too long.

I have always gone for wired headphones because I don't want to get caught out with a low battery,  But I do always get tangled up with the wire, so I might be keen on wireless.

I would probably choose wireless headphones because I don't always get on well with in ears.  Though in ears are better for exercising.

Sennheiser for over ear.  The best sound quality.

Sennheiser for on ear.  Also for really good sound.

Sony or Bose for wireless.  These both look really good.

Sennheiser for wired.  Both the pairs I own are wired and I'm really happy with them.

Bose for earphones for wireless...they're the ones with the pulse monitor.

Bose for true wireless buds.  These ones look good and like they would stay in well too. I expect premium to be better than anything else around.  I expect it to work flawlessly, be enjoyable to use and intuitive, look great and feel great.

RM Williams is an Australian boot maker who I think are at the top of their game (I shine shoes, so I see a lot of them!).  They started out making boots for farmers and cattle runners using only one piece of leather with only one seam at the back.  The boots are beautiful and really comfortable and the leather is really good quality.  The shop offers a free shoe shine service any time if you have bought from them which I think is a nice idea.  They are also nicely attentive and helpful in the Berwick St shop and there's only a small range of products which I like, so you don't have to rifle through for hours. They have a great quality product and they back that up with good customer service.

Primark! Going into Primark is the opposite of a premium experience.  The clothes are cheap and badly made by workers in bad conditions.  The shops are always a mess and it is a stressful experience.  If anything I feel more like a nuisance if I enter Primark, and I have certainly never felt like a valued customer. I struggled a bit with this one! I'm not someone that often spends large amounts of money on premium things, so I tried to think a little smaller in terms of what I consider to be a premium choice in my lifestyle.  And I realised I upgraded to Elizabeth Arden's 8 hour cream to use as lip balm at some point last year.  Before this I used to use any old thing, or Vaseline (which is the worst, but no-one ever told me!).  I decided that it was time to look after my lips a bit more carefully as I was struggling with them being dry and chapped.  I now spend around £25 on a 50ml tube instead of £1-£2 on the same amount.

I think this reflects a small change in my life,  I have started to take care of myself a bit better.  There has also been a shift into me buying more quality products that will be better and last longer.  I think this is a mindset, but has also coincided with earning a bit more money recently.

8 Hour Cream really soothes my lips and all the problems I was having with Vaseline and other balms have stopped.  I enjoy using it and I'm happy to spend the extra money because it works. Sennheiser because I've had a great experience with them.  They are really good quality and have great sound, which I think is the most important part of a pair of headphones.

Bose have a great style and are doing cool things like the wireless pulse monitor phones.

Sony often look good and are a really established brand.

I think the most premium pair of phones could be the new Sennheiser Momentum's.  I love this brand and like my older version of these.  Or the Bose QuietComfort 35 II, these look really good and if I was moving over to wireless I would definitely consider buying them.  I also like the voice control feature on them.

For me the most premium thing on a pair of headphones should be the sound quality, followed by comfort and convenience and then style.  Other things like pulse monitors and voice control are fun features, but they would be fun extras rather than reasons to buy them. I've already mentioned it a few times, but the gig I saw Christine and the Queens do at Brixton Academy was one of the best experiences I had this year.  Luckily a few of my friends were there to share it with me, but I have been telling everyone else about it all the time!

She is such a brilliant performer and she has a whole troupe of dancers on stage with her as well as a band.  The show is electrifying, from moments where the whole band and all of the dancers are giving it their all to when it's just Chris alone on stage singing or moving in a spotlight.

I didn't video the performance or I would share it with you here, but here is a link to her performing one of her songs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLa6I3Tyr_g A lot of my friends are talking about what it is too be a woman at the moment, the great stuff that comes with it alongside the not so great.  It feels like there has been a real push in starting to talk openly about all things womanly lately and I think it's great.  So much about being a woman has been shrouded in mystery which can lead to insecurities and doubts.  So it's great to be able to openly discuss things with my female friends without having to be worried, embarrassed or shamed.

I think the whole Me Too campaign has really highlighted how much we go through in silence and how much better things can be if we talk about what we're going through.  There's a real urge to support each other and also to bring to light the stuff that's been going on for years without anyone talking about it.  It really feels like we can get somewhere with gender equality.

At first I struggled to understand Me Too because I couldn't see why women were so openly talking about such horrible experiences.  It took me quite a few talks with others, and reading articles before I realised that perhaps the reason I was struggling with it was because it was so ingrained in me to keep quiet.  That was when I realised how important it is.

I keep up to date by talking to people.  I also check the Guardian app or BBC News.  Sometimes Twitter.

It's so hard to pick just one thing when so many changes need to be made! I think perhaps the most important thing could be equality.  There are so many people in need whose voices are never heard while a small amount of people control the media, the money and the power and want for nothing. 1: I think Apple do a really good job of marketing their products.  They manage to make everything look sleek and smart and people get excited about what they will bring out next.  
Bose Is doing a good job on their website.  It's a nice design and simple to find it is you're looking for.  It also makes the phones look good and useable.

2: I did some work with Pepsi through Sense last year and I have to say I don't think they have been getting it right for a while.  Their ads tend to be cheesy and cringey and unreliable.  To me it felt like they were trying to play it safe a lot of the time, but that just made the adverts irrelevant.
I just looked at the JVC website and it looks cheap.  I was immediately put off looking at any of their products.  The pictures they've used aren't enticing and don't draw me in at all.  If I had been searching for headphones I think I would've typed in another brand straight away.

3: I think Go Pro and Red Bull are a really good fit.  Red Bull has become a huge name in the world of extreme sports and Go Pros are massive for anyone doing extreme sports who wants to film themselves.  It makes perfect sense for these two to join forces.  
Beats by Dre made a good looking campaign, it made them look cool and stylish.

4: Pepsi really missed the mark with the Kendall Jenner advert and ended up upsetting a lot of people which is probably the worst thing you can do when you're trying to sell something.
I can't think of any headphone brands that have got it really wrong.  In fact apart from the ones I've mentioned I don't think I see a lot of adverts around for headphones. It's all about sound.  I would make sure my headphones had amazing sound quality, maybe even some controls to adjust things like bass and treble for people that like to fine tune their listening.  I think it's important to make them comfortable and I'd make them look great with a few different options to allow for different tastes.  Above all I would want to be selling a brilliantly made product that functions really well.",Sonic,INFP
295472,David,Quartey,Dquartey01@gmail.com,"Quite possibly the first 35mm film camera I bought myself. After some time getting into film photography, I began doing research into cameras and exploring the options available through ebay. 
I settled on a Chinon CG-5, from a smaller Japanese company that with a great viewfinder and reader has given opportunities to capture some memorable moments over the years in various cities. It has since allowed me to cycle around Birmingham inquisitively and meet people, sharing stories, purely by the chance of being out collecting visuals.

An interesting purchase as photography suddenly became a very important process for me and channeling a contemplative spirit heav a. unfortunately not my favourite pair but the current pair - Bought from sainsbury's as a model i've used before
b. an urgent replacement pair of headphones were needed after leaving mine behind at a friend's knowing I wouldn't see her for some time inbetween. Commutes need a soundtrack
c. Frequency range, ideally 0.4Hz-40kHz for the deepest of rumbling bass and twinkling high notes. Having a mic, play/pause and volume control 
d. Particular as these were going to be a backup pair of earphones, the price had to be suitable for that role. When paying more it would be the added control features and noise cancellation benefits of other earphones. A dream pair of headphones i'm looking at are AiAiAi TMA-1s which have customisable cups and are specificially designed for DJ use but are not oversized
e. read the back of the packaging
f. Sainsburys, for £16.99
g. they were needed at the time and would provide an even sound compared to the hollowness that can be found in cheaper airphones. Good tonality is pretty key a.
i. on-ear, previously over-ear may have been preferred but the quality of noise-cancelling technology alongside allowing ears to get some air rather than being encased within the earphone makes on-ear goood.
ii. Wireless headphones for sure. If moving to the added bulk of headphones, having them wireless and not worring about the (usually) thicker cable is great.
iii. wireless earphones maintain the feeling of wearing earphones in the traditional sense. Having them hung around your neck is helpful if in spaces where you would be in and out of listening and what them close to hand (or ear... lol...sorry...not sorry)

b
i. Bose QuietComfort QC35 II
ii. AiAiAi TMA-2 
iii. Sony WH-1000XM3
iv. Bowers & Wilkins P5 Series 2
v. OnePlus Bullets Wireless
vi. B&O Beoplay E8 a. regarding product, thinking material selection for comfort and durability. Or simply for clout, premium brands step forward to offer exclusive features at a pricepoint for those who have the available funds to appreciate and be interested in the 'deserved' price hike.

b. Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS
i. Huawei's top-tier phone, the Mate, rivals Samsung's Note series. It received technology updates such as in-screen fingerprint scanner allowing for a larger screen-to-body ratio (a keenly desired feature in phone design currently). Huawei invested in it's top-line QHD AMOLED curved displays for this model and sleek design incorporating a 3-camera setup. The phone packs a huge battery and wireless charging capabilities making it a reliable day-to-day machine as well as a large RAM makes this a futureproofed device that is distinguishable in exterior styling from the main flagships to be considered.

c. Balenciaga Triple S (fat trainers)
i. They're chunky and in fruity colour blocks, yeah they do look cool to those interested. Representing the chunky dad trainer trend it's appreciated for the avant-garde styling in the fashion world.
ii. At the obscene pricepoint, they do not offer any comfort rivalling trainers at a 10th of the cost from Nike/Adidas/New Balance among other brands. The added weight makes them heavy and ungainly with a triple midsole construction that offers very little benefit other than behemoth design... not for me at all... and can easily be brushed aside as unimportant I hope I honestly think I own anything premium myself... I tend to buy good trainers I trust as a rule, which I guess is my choice of premium. These Adidas City Cup Miles Silvas editions are simply beautiful. I tried not buying black trainers for some time and compromised with the red and white stripes (barely an effort made). There was a beautiful one-take street skating video featuring the sponsored athlete prior to the release of these also that completed the marketing it seems. Sold on the activity, sold on the product.

I think of it as a way of setting the essentials correctly, if the feet are looked after well then I can walk 'for days' in comfort as somebody who enjoys exploring and strolling where time permits. Having an interest in different sports bleeds across the styling choices that are made, from the clean aesthetics of tennis-inspired trainers to the functional poise and comfort of skateboarding and running trainers there's always something to appreciate from designs with their individual history providing context.

I feel sturdy, with a good amount of bounce made possible, they allow me to change modes swiftly meaning that trees can be climbed in the summer, running for a bus isn't an excessive feat, skateboarding is simple - sturdy alrounder creps. a. Bose is the immediate premium brand that comes to mind. Often seen as overpriced but rarely miss a beat when it comes to audio clarity across speakers (particularly surround sound) as well as headphones so for the extra few coins meh...
Sennheiser have always tailored to all price brackets with their top-end products being very well regarded for audio drivers and audio clarity. Often the headphone setups seen in studio/dj environments with good reason.

Beats by Dr.Dre lost me quite early in their release, the marketing was great with athlete sponsorship but the heavy lean towards bass muffles the sound quality and so I wouldn't choose these myself.

b. the Shure KSE1500 could be described as a perfect earphone, using electrostatic drivers, for a more detailed and accurate sound. Similar levels of audio engineering from other brands raise these above Skullcandys or House of Marley's that serve other customers very effectively for daily use.

c. as for headphone features, high fidelity audio is the most important thing. Whether this is achieved through larger impedence headphones and amplifiers, the user can expect to pick out more detail in their music comparable to vinyl or FLAC lossless files and .mp3. A. An article about the social hierarchy or naked mole rats
B. It was sent to me by a friend
C. It was fascinating! They are very similar to bees being eusocial with a queen rat that is huge in comparison to others. After each pregnancy their spine elongates allowing them to hold more babies in the litter. Kim Possible did a lot for naked mole rats but they're still massively underappreciated. 

D. https://dcist.com/story/18/12/17/after-bloodbath-the-national-zoos-naked-mole-rats-finally-choose-their-queen/ a. Living costs in cities and options for life outside of London.
b. I think it's the most tangible concern for the coming years. When considering job options and possibilities to spend time in other cities, the cost-benefit of home location being great for London in particular but also appreciating rent elsewhere, eyes start to wander.
c. Accumulated experience and opinions. It spreads into interests among the group relating to social issues and land use changes. Brownfield developments and architectural land-use is something I personally find interesting to will always take note of new developments and plans through magazines like Dezeen.
d. News sources range from trusted opinions, news and podcast sources, some long reads covering various current and historical topics. I start some mornings with BBC Radio 4 which offers an insightful discussion at most times.
e.
I'd change the working structure we have found ourselves in. I'm slowly realising that the hustle and bustle of the working week, if not fully motivating and in a toxic environment can be soul-crushing. Being able to have time in particular, to persue crafts and enjoy landscapes and nature as a general life rather than just a phase would be something special. It's a completely unattainable dream, but a simpler life. 1. Brands such as Adidas (particularly Skateboard and Football) that have a wide reach in their divisions across the sport itself and design options required for function. But they also really target the way people partake in the sport and the social dynamics of it. From football panna cages and music events to skate videos and soundtracks. They cover the nature of things and relate back to the consumer. 
Bowers & Wilkins as a headphone brand that exudes quality through the logo, choice of materials and general design of their product. This sets up for somebody who cares about their audio and wants the comfort of their headphones as they live life.

2. Skullcandy, personally I was never attracted to this brand with their louder designs appealing to a younger demographic. Even at that age it seemed that they were creating 'out there' products but would not have the same level of sound balance compared to others.

3. For me it would be Aiaiai and their artist series. As I don't pay too much attention to advertising for headphones but would rather look up brands and reviewed lists of products. There is a reputable quality to the artist series where the sound profile of each model in the line is tailored by the artist and the soundscape that they create/work in. They have a recent line with Brain Dead, a Los Angeles based creative collective

4. Beats by Dr Dre. Whilst the artist support is there and advertising is firm, spending time with these headphones early in their release as they were so widespread the bulky design and frequency they would break tarnished my opinion of them and I see no reason to change. It would be very simple in intent. Clearly outlining specs and intentions without excess. 
Featuring memory foam or TPU headphones, and balanced sound profile that's flexible across many genres. By delivering the quality through material selection and sound tuning they would be spoken about by people of a trusted opinion. 

- Cult classic, not bestseller. (Thank you Mike Skinner.",Sonic,
295473,Nathaniel,Cole,natty.cole@gmail.com,"It would be my Swim Dem Crew sliders. It was a huge financial risk to even begin the research process on development for them and then finally sending the email and money to get them made was a scary moment. It was the first major investment in my business and a bit of a leap of faith, to be honest. Since making them we have made half of our money back without actually releasing them to the general public yet which is huge. I think the sales have given me a confidence boost for the power of my brand. a)
I follow quite a few tech Youtubers online and UrAvgConsumer and MKBHD had all done videos on these headphones and put it in their suggested Christmas gift lists.

b)
Funny story - I nearly had to take a company to court over using my image on an advert and I bought new headphones with the money I got from the advert. I had wanted some for a couple of years but I wanted my headphones to be an investment rather than simply being ok.

c)
Sound quality above all else. Noise cancellation is a bonus but I NEED headphones that can reproduce the sounds that were present in the recording studio. The small stares and claps that are left behind in headphones with lesser range.

d) 
I'm willing to pay more for comfort and slimness now that I think about it. My headphones sound great but I can't relax fully on an aeroplane with them. The headphones have their own battery-powered drivers which makes them slightly more chunky.

e) Where did you look for/get information to help you make the decision?
YouTube, Richer Sounds website, Amazon is my main points of call when I'm looking to invest in new headphones or speakers.

f) Where and when did you buy these? How much did you pay?
I bought them on Amazon when it was Black Friday.

g) What ultimately sold you on these headphones?
The good reviews from the YouTubers and website reviews on Amazon. a)
i) Over-ear vs. on-ear headphones

It has to be on-ear. The isolation that they offer is better than on-ear for me.

ii) Wireless vs. wired headphones
I USED to think that wired are the best way and deep down I believe that they will always offer a better sound with a good DAC adapter, however, having used wireless headphones for a year, I think that the freedom they offer is too much to give up.

iii) Wireless earphones vs. true wireless buds 
True wireless - I haven't got any wireless buds but have seen friends use AirPods and their ease of use is RIDICULOUS. I have wireless earphones and the cable is quite annoying, to be honest. Earbuds seem SO much easier!

Apple AirPods a) If you buy something ‘premium’, what is your expectation of that product/service?
To be a cut above the rest. It should really have the right feel. It should feel like it costs the money that I'm spending on it. I expect it to be well made as well, although I never want to drop it, it shouldn't break easily.

b) Think of a product/service/brand or experience that you consider to be premium.
i) Tell us about it.
Annoyingly, it's probably Apple. It seems quite basic to me but for the products that I own, my MacBook Pro definitely is premium to me. 

ii) Why do you think this is premium?
It's premium because of the build quality, the purchasing experience and the price, unfortunately.

c) What about a product / service / brand or experience that is not premium, in your opinion?
i) Tell us about it.
Keeping it in the tech realm, I would say Xiaomi, they make very good looking products that sometimes perform well but the customer support isn't there and that's a real shame.

ii) They
Why is this not premium?

Their customer support and different materials that are used often don't feel the same way. Another brand is Marley, they're good and cheap but fall apart. a)
This is my MacBook Pro. I bought it this summer, it was a huge upgrade from my old Lenovo laptop. It was so nice to have a thin, light and powerful laptop now. I use it for photo and video editing as well as my writing.

b)
That I'm a sheep! Haha. I wouldn't actually have got a MacBook Pro if Apple didn't drive up the market price for all ultrabooks. With that being said, I really enjoy the ease of use of OS X. I think it says that I'm a creative, although I disagree with that very statement.

c)
It makes me feel good because I bought this with my own money (and family discount thanks to a friend). It makes me feel like I'm moving the right way in my career and stuff. a) What headphone brands do you think are premium? Why are they premium?
Bose and Sony come to mind. Bose has always had the premium price tags but uses cheap materials, a bit like Apple, customers are paying for the design more than anything. Their QC headphones are brilliant though.

Sony has worked really hard in the last couple of years to marry premium audio and premium design and nailed it with their recent headphones.

b) Are there some models that are more premium than others? What ones? Why?
I think with Beats and brands like that, people are paying for the name more than anything and the unboxing experience. The nice things that come WITH the headphones more than anything, the carrying cases, braided cables and things like that. I mentioned Marley previously and their cheap products. There's also JBL as well. Brands that exist to service low to mid-level consumers.

c) Are there some headphone features that are more premium than others? What ones? Why?
Yes, there are some features that are more premium. Voice assistants definitely come to my mind. It seems pretty awesome to have Google AI or Amazon Echo built into a device for the extra features that it gives you. a) What was it?
Have you seen the play called Misty? It's a fantastic piece of theatre. It blew me away and has been given an extended run and changed the writer's life.

b) Where did you see it?
Bush Theatre, one of my favourite theatres that have more Black-leaning programming (like the Young Vic too),

c) Why did it excite you so much?
Because it told a story that we all knew in an eloquent way in a medium that was new for so many of us (Theatre).

d) Please share it with us if you can.
https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/misty-west-end/ GO BUY TICKETS AND SEE IT. a) I talk to a lot of my friends about the Black diaspora and how we move forward as a people. There's also politics too. In Swim Dem I often moderate conversations on politics between our members.

b) They provoke debate because they're important to us and we're directly affected by the actions of politicians, so it doesn't make sense to ignore it. 

c) I get my opinion on politics from people that I follow on Twitter and articles as well. I'm wary of the media and how they portray their own narrative, so I seek to find my own news that I can digest. There's a great quarterly magazine called Delayed Gratification that I recommend. 

d) Again, Twitter and news sites. Twitter always knows things first, whether it's national disasters or scandals with celebrities. One that broke this morning involved Louis C.K and Ricky Gervais saying the N-Word during a show with them, Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld was sadly the only one that had a problem with it, which is ridiculous.

e) The government. I would want everything to be disbanded and rebuilt with people, real people at the core. I'm left wing in most senses but I want people to govern themselves rather than one government. People like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxine Waters shouldn't be the anomaly in politics, they should be the norm. 1) ASOS are doing brilliantly and it's quite sad to see that they're reporting losses for this year. Their brand collusion, while named stupidly, still had a brilliant message behind it. Their use of influencers for their styles and the way that they have embraced body positivity is commendable. I understand that those things are very 'in' right now but it still takes people in suits, that are so far removed from their consumers to believe and sign off on things like that, things that are 'risks' and without them agreeing, we sadly don't get to see those collaborations and campaigns, so I'm happy that they have people that believe in the creative that is presented to them.

Beats should also get an honourable mention. Three and two years ago they were absolutely killing the relationships with celebrity endorsement. They birthed a whole new industry segment of 'premium, nice-to-look-at, headphones'. Sony and Sennheiser wouldn't have colourful headphones if not for Beats.

2) Quite a few brands have had racist campaigns in the past. I don't even get angry at it anymore because I believe the companies do it on purpose to profit on Black outrage. PRADA did one recently and came under fire from Black people and in Asia as well I think? I can't even remember.

3) Swim Dem Crew and Speedo :) - we took a traditional brand, flipped it and showed them that swimmers are human beings too, not just professional athletes. 

4) Google  - They have the absolute best phone in a smartphone in the world right now and have done for the last two years but people that are using Apple devices don't know it. They need to start walking the walk and talking the talk. My BILLION dollar idea yeah? Ha.

For me, it would be activations based around the idea of sound. A festival of sounds. So, think to yourself, what is sound? Where does it exist and how does it relate to us all? I would put on a series of events that explore the different type of sounds that are afforded to us in the world, what they mean to us and then think about how our headphones support that. 

Some would be based around music, some on poetry, some on speaking, some on wellness, it's so varied but it would allow you to reach a multitude of consumers and give them each something that they care about individually.

Obviously, you need celebrity endorsements for the larger campaigns and influencers and community engagement for it all to work but if it did...it could be BIG.",Sonic,
295474,Stuart ,Baird,sbeef1@gmail.com,"The item i'm most proud of is the B&O Play H9 headphones that I own. They have active noise reduction (not noise cancelling) and a good audio quality. When selecting this pair of headphones i actually had another model (and brand) in mind. I wanted to go to a store and try out a few models for myself to test out fit, quality of sound and comfort. Bearing in mind i need my headphones to be able to withstand an active lifestyle and an energetic workout. If a pair of headphones can't live up to my workouts I will not use them. My initial feelers would reach out to reviews on google, but i would test models in store once i've researched enough. The H9's are quite funky in that they have a touch control pad which makes them stand out on top of the fact that they have such good sound quality. I had been searching for a pair of standard wireless headphones that I could use in the gym because normal earphones and headphones were useless in this function. At my gym they play music from various radio stations which i don't want to listen to, so i needed a pair that would cancel out that music as well as provide good quality audio. Another key consideration was that they needed to be breathable, durable and be able to stay on my head during workouts. My price range was originally going to be up to £120. I had looked on google which had sent me to comparison articles and sites like Argos and Currys' PC World, this brought up a couple of good recommendations and I was leaning towards a pair of skullcandy headphones which were on sale at £99.99. 

I had however decided to go into Currys and test them out before i bought them. Whilst I was in the store trying out a couple of pairs, I asked a technician for his opinion of which would be better, a Sony pair or the Skullcandy pair that i was considering. He recommended the Sony pair but asked if i was prepared to go a little higher price wise and get the Beoplay H9 pair as he said they had superior sound and build quality especially for the price. As they were on sale for £140 down from £360 I jumped at the chance and got them. They have lived up to the sound and build quality as well as battery life and functionality. However I would like them to go a little higher volume wise and have a better capability for bass. I would definitely recommend them for someone who is quite active and likes to really listen to tracks in all their intricacies. Price was a big factor but the difference of £40 compared to the difference in quality was inconsequential. a.i) + ii) I much prefer over ear headphones to on ear as they are much less irritating to my ears, especially when I take into consideration how long I wear them at one time. It also provides better noise cancellation. Wireless definitely wins out but it definitely has to have a long battery life (10 hours minimum) for it to be worth it. The wire on wired headphones just gets in the way when I'm in motion and doing workouts so it's definitely a big factor.
iii). I've never used true wireless buds but I would go for these in this comparison. The less attached parts the better, the only other factor for the decision in this is price as they are usually more expensive.

B.i) Bose quietcomfort 35
ii) beats solo3
iii) Bose quietcomfort 35
iv) Bose quietcomfort 35 wired
V) Bose soundsport
Vi) Bose soundsport free wireless If I pay the premium price I expect the product to be good quality, perform its main function to a high level and last a long time. 

I consider Bose to be premium because they ask for a premium price and sell a high volume at that asking price. The reviews people post of their premium headphones are always high on average. They also have a good build quality and performance. They know what their customers want and innovate accordingly.

I would say JBL is not a premium brand, they sell products at the low to medium price range on the market. They have good reviews at that level, when paying a lower price you expect the standard to drop. I've tested a few models of this brand and they are ok, they have average sound quality which increases as you go higher in price for this brand. They are comfortable in their area but they can't compete with brands like Bose when it comes to audio quality. It is not premium because it doesn't produce models that compete with the staple top brands. These headphones are wireless, noise reducing and very durable. They have a touch pad on the right side that controls volume, skips forward and backward and pauses a track. 
I think this says that I care about the way I listen to music and music is a big part of my day to day life. I think it says that I'm willing to invest in a product that I believe will live up to the investment.
It makes me feel like I'm in my own little bubble and it gives me another level of focus and energy when I need it most. It delivers my music to me in a beautiful way and manages to make me feel relaxed when I need to be and feel hyped up when I need to be. It's a good companion to my lifestyle. Bose, sennheiser, B&O and Beats all come to mind. They all have their strengths when it comes to sound quality. Moreso than other standard brands. As brands research and innovate, new models have better sound quality and features incorporated in the design. Beats studio wireless are a good example of premium quality because they are indorsed by so many people in the industry and have premium features such as good bass capabilities. 

Good noise cancellation is always a feature that sets brands apart, along with the level of adaptability depending on what kind of track your listening to. A. Jennah bell - candied daylight 
B. I first came across her music on soundcloud
C. it was so exciting because she's up and coming and has a really fresh and different sound. I've not heard anyone like her yet on the UK mainstream r&b scene and so 'candied daylight' was a breath of fresh air. Education is a source of heat amongst my friend group. We all have different opinions on the matter but I don't like the uniformity and factory-like qualities of many educational establishments. The fact that teachers have a script that they're allowed to draw from to teach students is worrying. 
This is always a source of provocation in this day and age because younger generations seem to be looking for a change and a sense of individuality whereas older generations seem to want things to remain the same or go back to how they were (speaking very broadly of course).

I formed my opinion from going through the education system all the way to university and out the other side (I survived). I just disagreed with a majority of the teaching methods from start to finish.
My mother is still a teacher, currently a vice principal in a secondary school and I use her as a source of up to date information. 
I would change the distribution of wealth if there was one thing I could change. Bose and Reebok are getting it right as their endorsements with athletes and others seem to have widened their reach in the industry. 

For me, apple will always be doing it wrong because they are overpriced and don't have the features or performance of other brands at the same price. I would say that new balance are falling off endorsement wise and are not thinking outside of the box.

Adidas and dragon ball z have collaborated to produce some of the most amazing trainers known to man!! Under armour have been collaborating with Dwayne Johnson to great success! They've brought out a new pair of active headphones which I've had my eye on.

Pepsi and Kendall Jenner definitely made a bad move with their nod to the BLM movement. Jamie Oliver and his caribbean rice were a bad move, it's hard to go as wrong as he did. It just wasn't authentic flavours or ingredients and it was badly introduced. B&O already appeals to people who appreciate music and it's sounds and melodies. I would market more to the every day listener and try to approach a wider audience. I had never heard of the brand until I was introduced to it in a store. So I would endorse a celebrity that average people would relate to (Tom Hardy).",Sonic,

I always  do a bit of internet research then go into a couple of specialist shops and talk to experts regarding the different brands and models. What caught my attention was the noise cancelling and sound quality.
B. My old headphones broke and I required a replacement for work, travel, gym, everyday life
C. Price, Brand, Quality 
D. The items with the best quality often are more expensive. It's a tradeoff between what I use them for and the quality of the headphone. I'll consider it and won't spend ridiculous money, however, I do want a decent pair. Comfort/ergonomics, noise cancelling, bass control, design and material/ how long they will last.
E. Experts, Youtube videos, electronic blogs. I often google what i'm looking for and just do some research.
F. Currys in Manchester, 4 months ago. £85.
G. It was the noise cancelling. Ai. Over ear. Quite an odd one but my ears are reasonably small so on-ear headphones don't fit. Plus I find them less invasive, it's not like my ear drums are going to rupture when I want to turn it up a little.
ii. Preferable both. If i had to choose on it would by wireless. More moveability/ flexibility, easily portable and don't have to worry about the cable breaking or detaching.
iii. Wireless buds. Look better than the wireless earphones, although have more potential of getting lost. Also don't need to worry about wires tangling or breaking.

iv. Unsure
v. Unsure
vi. Airpods a. To be a cut above the rest, to be innovative (the best brands set trends) , to be simplistic and complex but have enough varying features that makes it ultimately better than the average brand. The aesthetic design and the level of attention to detail has to account for as many little variables as possible. The presentation of the product or the service has to make it desirable to the masses and general consensus is that it is better.
b. Apple Macbook Pro
i.&ii. Apple have created in my opinion a laptop which can do it all. Many of the components are top of the line, the design of the mac is sleek and sophisticated, it feels comfortable to use. However, most importantly their attention to detail is phenomenal, the varying shortcuts and the ease of use (you can link all your devices through the cloud) makes it difficult to go back to PC after you've had a Mac. Which coincidentally is the same with most Apple products. The marketing for the product is also outstanding, some people even see it as a status symbol to on a Mac pro.
c.  Hisense TV's, TalkTalk 23mb 'ultra fast broadband', JBL headphones.
i. & ii. What all the products i've listed above have in common is they are imitations of what premium brands produce, however, in no way do they reach the same level as their premium counterparts. They do a job and are an option if you have a restricted budget, however if you compare the the definition of Hisense 4k tv with a Sony or LG tv you can tell the sparkle isn't quite there. The speed average of the talktalk broadband is still 3/4 x slower than Virgins Fibre Optic alternative, the JBL headphones are thin and wiry in comparison to some Bose. The brands do not execute premium to the same quality level set by the leaders in their field. a. This is my Apple Macbook, which some may believe to be a contentious decision. However, I believe in comparison to alternative high street laptops they are better in many ways. I believe the design and feeling of the mac is smoother and sleeker than many PCs. I spend a huge amount of time on it and probably take it most places with me: to work, to coffee shops etc... Whether it's browsing youtube, Netflix'ing, music blogs, or brushing up on my photoshop techniques it's massively multi functional.

b. When I brought it at University it was a statement, as you can get alternative laptops at a much lower price. At the time it was a little bit of a stunt, in terms of going to the library or to a lecture and using a Macbook and I'd definitely attach some status from having them but, I'd also say i've grown out of that. In all honesty, I wanted to purvey that I had more money than I actually did at the time. Which is possible why many people want to have premium things, they give the world a perception that may not necessarily be true.

c. As I've had it for some many years, it's normal now. But when I first got it, I'd defo say it does give you a little boost, you do feel like you're slightly more important you're hoping that by having it people think a little bit differently about you. Now, I'm just happy that since Day 1 it has worked at a consistent level, so I'm pleased that I invested my money in a product which has stood the test of time (even if my stickers haven't!!). a. Premium has to be taken as a mixture of quality, how they sound how they feel, and how they make you feel.
Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Skullcandy - Commercial beasts, they merge quality with a higher than average pricing point, they have become the most recognisable names for headphones, which allows the average consumer to be attracted to them. They are brands which in general provide very good beginner, intermediate and advanced headphones. Whilst, I believe Bose re the best of the bunch. I think the branding and marketing of beats is possible the best of all the brands. 
Grado and Shure - Not as well known to the average consumer however, they are of debatable higher quality than the other brands. I only came across Shure through a friend who DJ'd and was surprised at how good his brand of headphones were. 

b. Bose and Shure - I believe these headphones have the best design, fit and quality out of the more mainstream brands. The noise cancelling prevents more external noise, the bass rattles harder and the sound is of more quality than many others. Also when you hold them in your hands, they feel like they are high quality, they're more sturdy and weighty.

c. I like an opportunity to have bass control on my headphones, if they are going to be my portable speakers, it's good to be able to have a little more control than just volume.
However, most headphones have the same features, whether it's bluetooth, noise cancelling etc... I believe it's about the how they execute the features. Anderson Paak European tour announcement.

It popped up on twitter first and then followed this up my numerous music blogs and websites. 

Me and my friends are massive fans of him as an artist, we've been following him for years and managed to get tickets when first performed in Manchester. He's gone on to become a massive artists and his music keeps getting better. So super excited to see him as he's grown as an artist.

https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/anderson-paak-2019-tour-dates/ a. I think we all have that one massive group chat which is an amalgamation of couple different friendship groups. We literally discuss everything current affairs but th emost controversial are: Sports (Football being the main one), Politics (It's impossible to avoid Brexit conversations these days), Music (ranging from the industry to new releases, to top 5's etc...), Racism, How we live our lives...

b. I think the world seems more confusing, ambiguous and non-linear than in the past. People and society is changing and I think the human mind likes routine. Sport is changing, money has more influence in the game and the revenue generated by the industry has diverged the definition of success from simply winning fixtures to increasing your brand abroad.
Politics will always be the most contentious topic you can talk about, however, recent developments in the political landscape in the UK and in Europe has caused people to become more entrenched in their own ideologies or move further out towards more extreme ideas.
Music evokes passion as it's so tied into our emotions, similarly to sport the nature of music is changing it feels like there are more artists churning out more music and it's hard to cut above some of the noise. 
How we live our lives... Being in our mid 20's we're all trying to just figure life out, we don't know if what we're doing is wrong our right but we have good intentions. We debate everything from girls/marriage to new trends and style.

c. One example is Brexit - I'm pro remain where as I have a couple of friends that are leave. I studied the EU when I was at uni, do ascertained more of knowledge of politics and the complexities than you can learn from the platitudes produced by politicians. I'm happy to change my opinion based on the facts which are presented to me. It's very difficult as everything is written from a perspective it's hard to discern what is factual and what isn't. I try to engage critically with all things I read and take it with a pinch of salt.

Beats by Dre - Their marketing has been top notch, the image they have and the cosign by Dr. Dre which led it to being bought by apple, despite in my opinion not having the best headphones, the Beats Studio's were iconic and a huge status symbol throughout my youth. Further endorsement from sports brands enhanced their cool.
Colors Berlin - Simple, Clean cut and well executed. The idea is simply to get upcoming artists from across the world to perform one of their tracks. They then match the background colour to what the artist is wearing. Visually impeccable and their selection of artists has been amazing. https://colors-studios.com/

Facebook - A lot of uncertainty and questions around privacy, fake news and it's purpose has become unclear and the answers to the questions not been satisfactory from Mark Zuckerberg. I stopped using it as it just became a forum of people sharing videos and 'friends' who weren't really friends.

Air Jordans x PSG - Having a brand as iconic as Air Jordan known for basketball, create a kit for a team which has as much romanticism as Paris St Germain, and the kit was suave as you'd expect. It was just a big yes in my book. https://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/pw/jordan-paris-saint-germain/ofqZ8a9

225795,Cheryl,Wallace,cheryllynn2u@yahoo.com,"YOGURT: probiotics, ‘healthy” food or snack, “nutritional”, ”beneficial” to your health/gut, dairy product thus “calcium boost”, unflavored Greek yogurt is a healthier alternative to sour cream. Greek yogurt may have more health benefits than regular yogurt. I am lactose intolerant these days, so eat very small amounts of yogurt these days. New news to me: yogurt is highly sweetened and artificially flavored and processed THUS NOT a healthy food at all. My husband and I used to love frozen yogurt thinking it was healthier than ice cream ~ not so much evidently! Now I can’t eat that either due to dairy intolerance. I would be VERY interested in trying non-dairy yogurt. 
 Dannon and Yoplait are very well known brands. For a short while we tried to eat Activa (but hated artificial sweetener taste). Many years ago I would buy generic store brand yogurt but quit with my understanding of nutritional quality. I also purchase unsweetened yogurt as sour cream replacement and recently purchased the Trader Joe brand (natural, organic) Greek Yogurt. Obviously I’m aware of other brands such as Chobani and Page. I haven’t purchased them any time in recent memory. Lately I’ve found two new brands that we like. The newest, “farm-fresh whole milk, sweet honey, and real fruit puree” yogurt is called Noosa. We love the taste, texture and natural flavors! It is most often available at stores that sell more organic and healthy foods, but also at Costco . Epoca Cool + Plain is a drinkable yogurt with probiotics we were introduced to by a friend and we love it as well. It is available at Costco. They are small 2 oz servings, taste great and are, hopefully, giving us some healthy probiotics. We pay a premium price for organic, real food flavors in our yogurt because our health matters. But due to my lactose intolerance, I have to eat very small portions. A friend introduced this liquid yogurt beverage to us and we LOVE it! It’s full or probiotics and has a good taste. We were glad to find it. Noosa is actually our favored yogurt brand right now. I mentioned it previously. It is delicious and a healthier product than other alternatives
 I have tried 4 of brands of Greek Yogurt, but usually get Trader Joe’s. I like their store and trust their brand. It contains good probiotics and works for the “sour cream alternative” for which I purchase it.
 I no longer purchase Dannon, Yoplait, Lucerne yogurts. They are very high in sugars and can be worse for one’s health than more maligned “treats.” I love the sweet tang of (sweetened) yogurt and the versatility of Greek, but I have serious “dairy digestion” issues. I’d be very interested in trying a non-dairy, non-soy alternative. I have found delightful flavors for “creamers” that combine almond and coconut milk. Adding stevia, honey or maple as sweetener would grab my attention, as would anything that says DARK CHOCOLATE. Because there are many of us who can no longer tolerate milk, I believe NON-DAIRY, healthy, probiotic- rich (if possible) would grab our attention. It might be good to target women past child-bearing age who have osteoporosis concerns and require non-dairy. I think it would be fascinating to have someone like Demi Moore, who isn’t heard from much these days, or Barbra Streisand because just their names/faces would speak to many of us and get our attention. For younger audience, someone like Adele (with lactose intolerance OR serious animal rights concerns Names: choc-co-mond yogurt alternative (chocolate, coconut, almond) with Stevia; pumpkin spice non-dairy yogurt alternative (w real pumpkin, honey, seasonings)  Packaging: Simple, clean, eye-catching colors (one of my paintings, for example LOL) The point being, colors that catch the eye and speak to the heart Uncompromised Goodness This says more about nutritional benefits than others; still doesn't mention quality of vanilla, sugar content, artificial ingredients, etc. Consumers are reading labels!! We want to know what additives and preservatives are in our food and are making every effort to avoid them. Also, maybe using coconut sugar as opposed to processed sugars. Or even to use maple sugar, a healthier alternative, as one flavor. I still oppose statements that assume you are The Best! Possibly a challenge: Give us a try! We feel we have the best tasting non-dairy yogurt that will satisfy your hunger and energy needs. Our plant-based Blue Diamond almond yogurt has the familiar light and smooth texture of other yogurts and is a great source of calcium. That this might be a healthier alternative than a dairy product - there are concerns about milk products and their digestibility even when people are not lactose intolerant. The statement omits mention of vanilla, which might be a good addition to the description. My preference would be to say: This delicious non-dairy yogurt is created for you with uncompromised attention to quality. We use BD almonds etc and real, highest quality vanilla creating a healthy and deliciously creamy alternative for those desiring plant-based almondmilk yogurt. Doesn't mention vanilla or clear reference to almonds (yes, it's in almondmilk~)  I don't like this statement for reasons previously stated - too overstated, ""Luxuriously creamy"" sounds ""grandiose"".  I don't think this is a real statement. We are not looking for experience. As consumers, we are looking for quality, flavor, health and nutritional value. This statement really says nothing about comparison to dairy yogurt: do they taste the same, similar, made with artificial ingredients, preservatives? Suggestion: A delicious and healthy non-dairy alternative made with all natural BD almond milk and vanilla, our almondmilk yogurt will satisfy your cravings for a healthy snack any time of your day. Yogurt - can it be spelled YOGHURT and be a different product? What about using the term: 
 Cultured non-dairy ALMOND MILK product* Maybe saying “active and live cultures” - assuming that’s true. Probiotics are important to us, you know! 
 I think yogurt is misleading. 1. I believe it would best be located away from Yoplait and other dairy yogurts to stand apart - probably along with Silk. The fact it is non-dairy is a big selling factor. In terms of the definitions, I believe it falls best under Contemporary as the dairy diet issues effecting so many of us are becoming more well known. It should definitely be made VERY clear that it is non-dairy, the probiotics present, the sugars used, emphasize the positives.

225793,Brian,Henry,Brianh8525@yahoo.com,"1. When I of yogurt i think of the brand,size, price, flavors, and the nutritional facts on the back. Yoplait, Dannon, Activia, Chobani, and Voskos.  2. I love the many options in yogurt that are out now. I can choose a yogurt for health purposes like Activia or a Greek yogurt. I can just go with a Yoplait  or Dannon for fun and the pleasure of the yogurt I remember as a kid. Whats not so great about yogurt is that its a dairy and it give me sinus congestion. I love it regardless but I cant stop eating it. 3. I just recently heard about nondairy yogurt. I have no opinion until i try it. 4. I consider the Brand, flavors, and taste? 5. The more exclusive it is the more it should cost. CHOBANI 
 1. I LOVE THE VARIETY OF FLAVORS THIS PARTICULAR BRAND HAS. 
 2. YES I BUY THIS BRAND OFTEN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ON SALE. I LOVE THE TASTE ESPECIALLY THE STRAWBERRY FLAVOR. ITS RICH AND CREAMY. 
 3. IT'S TRYING TO SAY THAT ITS A QUALITY BRAND WITH STRONG FLAVORS AND INGREDIENTS. I ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE MESSAGES FROM THE BIBLE ABOUT FAITH AND TRUST. YOU CAN TRULY TRUST THIS BRAND AND HAVE FAITH IN THE QUALITY. 4. BLUE DIAMOND SHOULD THINK ABOUT  PRESENTING A GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT AND AVOID CUTTING CORNERS. IT SHOULD BE WORTH THE MONEY WE PAY FOR IT. 5. I LOVE THE CONTAINER IT COMES IN. IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET EVERY LAST DROP OF YOGURT OUT WITH THE SPOON. YOPLAIT GREEK 100 PROTEIN 1. I DON'T LIKE THIS. IT TASTE LIKE THEY PUT EQUAL SUGAR IN IT. 2. I ONLY PURCHASED IT ONCE AND NEVER PURCHASED IT AGAIN. I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE TASTE 3. THE BRAND IS TRYING TO SAY WE COULDN'T FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN GREAT TASTE AND HEALTHY. I CAN ASSOCIATE IT WITH A STORE BRAND ITEM. 4. BLUE DIAMOND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PRODUCT AND DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE. PUT WORK INTO MAKING SURE THE TASTE IS WORTHWHILE. 5. THE DESIGN IS OF THE PACKAGING IS GOOD. YOU WANT TO BE SURE THE SPOON IS ABLE TO GET ALL THE YOGURT OUT WITHOUT OBSTACLE. DANNON LIGHT & FIT 1. I DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF THIS YOGURT. IT TASTES LIKE MEDICATION. 2. I PURCHASED IT WHEN I WAS ON A DIET AND I HATED IT. IT  WAS NASTY AND HAD A BITTER TASTE TO IT. 3. THE BRAND WAS TRYING TO PUT OUT PRODUCT THAT WOULD APPEAL TO PEOPLE WHO EAT HEALTHY BUT THEY FAILED MISERABLY. THEY SHOULD CONSIDER STICKING TO THEIR STRENGTHS 4. BLUE DIAMOND SHOULD MAKE SURE THEIR ATTEMPT AT MAKING A HEALTHIER CHOICE YOGURT IS DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND NOT A CHEAP ATTEMPT AT MAKING MONEY. 5. THE PACKAGING WAS GOOD. I WOULD SAY IT COULD BE BIGGER  BUT IT WOULDN'T MATTER FOR ME. THAT WOULD BE A WASTE EITHER WAY. 1. MAKE SURE IT TASTES GOOD. IT NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY AND EDIBLE. 2. MAKE SURE THE PACKAGING STICKS OUT. AND THE PRODUCT TASTES GOOD. 3. IT SHOULD BE BOLD AND BRAVE. CHOBANI IS A BOLD AND BRAVE BRAND TO ME. ESPCIALLY WITH THE FLAVOR CHOICES, LIKE COFFEE BLEND AND S'MORES, 4. BLUE DIAMOND ALGURT ( ALMOND +YOGURT) 5. IT NEEDS TO BE OPEN AND HAVE NO OBSTACLES THAT STOPS THE SPOON FROM GETTING ALL THE YOGURT OUT Deliciously Healthy 1. I'm wondering what they're talking about  in regard to the product. it doesn't simply explain the benefits of the yogurt. 2. Mentioning that it's a plant based yogurt. That's eye catching for vegans and people who desire more plant based options. 3.  The tasty source of calcium. sadly that's the last thing people think of we need to know the other benefits that come from eating this yogurt. 4.Why is this positioning saying so much but not getting to the point. Its using words like vitality. I shouldn't have to go to the dictionary to find out what you're trying to say. I would like to know the benefits of this product simple and direct. 5. I would tell more about how this product will help the consumer. use more commons words to describe it. I feel like it stop the consumer from getting lost in reading about the product. 1. I think its telling me that the yogurt is really good for a non-dairy, plant based yogurt. You must always mention the word healthy or healthier. They left that out. 2. The mention of deliciously creamy non-dairy, plant based almondmilk yogurt. It points out all the major points of the product. 3. Blue Diamond almonds from our California growers is pointless. It doesn't matter where it comes from as long as its non-dairy and plant based. 4. I would like to know more about its fiber and sugar contents. 5. Eliminate the part about where the almonds are grown. It means nothing. This will allow the product to be describe before the reader gets bored. Simple and direct is always good. 1. The yogurt is good and its better for you especially if you're lactose intolerant. Nothing is left unsaid in my opinion. 2. The mention of almond milk. Most people know that almond milk is healthier than Regular milk and soy milk. 3. The use of the word luxuriously is weak. We all know eating healthy isn't anything luxurious. We just have to do it to live long and healthy. You don't have to do all that to convince me. Telling me that its good and creamy is good enough for me. 4. I want to know if it will add any fiber to my diet and how much sugar is in it. 5. just eliminated the catchy words like luxuriously and I'm good. it would make me believe more that this is better for me. Big words don't impress me. 1. Non-Yogurt 2. I like it but I would totally miss the fact that it's a yogurt alternative. 3.Yogurt-Free Cultered Almondmilk. I feel like the word yogurt has to appear so people will know what to buy. Most people wont recognize it under cultured milk. 1. Contemporary. Because its a new and modern twist on yogurt for health purposes. 2. Make The packaging simple and bold. Stick with the Almond breeze logo  3. By showing off the health benefits of this plant based food. 
 4. I think a few will work just fine. The Chobani design is the best in my opinion.",Smoothie,
225799,Isabelle,Hierholtz,isabellehierholtz@hotmail.com,"What are are all the things that come to mind when you think about the yogurt category?   - Healthy, wholesome, European, organic, Greek, sour, versatile, breakfast, cooking ingredient, staple, lactose, non-fat, dairy, flavored, petits suisses, quark, dietary, for kids, for families, for people who watch what they eat Who are the different players and what do their brands represent to you? 
 Yoplait/Danone: my (French) childhood: I think of the two brands as being sister brands. Are they made by the same people? Probably not but totally interchangeable. Danone might have edge on health and Yoplait edge on fun and kids. Yogurts in individual serving pots, flavored/cartoon yogurts for kids, they do drinkable versions in plastic bottles for kids, used to have full fat artisan recipe in glass jars when I was little in France, low fat sweet options  with fruit/jam/cereal for dieting indulgence for adults - something for every one! Wallaby Organic Greek 0%: premium yogurt, so smooth, delicious flavor even for non-fat variety, doesn't require sweetener, used to buy (for husband) but SO expensive! Comes in big multi-serve pot. Open Nature Greek 0%, plain: local brand (CA), big pots, non fat version is slightly thick and dry, needs a bit of sweetener to go down and texture improves if you add a tiny bit of water and whisk it. Not too expensive, our go-to yoghurt staple (2 to 3 pots a week) - lowest sugar content to highest protein content. FAGE total 0%: individual or large pots, authentic Greek yogurt, very dry - perfect for extreme low fat dieting, otherwise really hard to swallow. Expensive. My go-to yogurt brand when I travel to China or in airports/travelling when I want a plain non fat yogurt. CHONABI: colorful, individual pots, fruit flavors, for women (but not me!) NOOSA: 'fancy pantsy' expensive yogurt, in flat packaging which is really different (like for hummus - wider than tall) not necessarily super healthy (high in sugar) it's more about 'healthy indulgence' but probably better off with piece of toast with peanut butter! OIKOS: black packaging, yogurt for guys who work out and watch their weight ACTIVIA: pro-biotic, gut health, immune system OUI: new brand (or at least I just noticed it), little glass individual pots ""French Style"" it does look a lot like the yogurt pots of my French childhood but suspect it's a marketing ploy and they're manufactured in NJ. The Haagen Daaz of yogurt probably! :) CLOVER: big local CA dairy, I always picture cows eating grass giving yummy creamy fresh milk! Don't buy it as sugar content is higher than Open Nature, and there's less protein content. YAKULT: doesn't sit in yogurt aisle but think of it as non dairy yogurt! probiotic etc.., have one every day on every other week.  2. What do you love about yogurt? A good healthy versatile staple. Fills you up. Great as base for breakfast or as a healthy 'dessert'. Great as heathy ingredient as alternative to sour cream  What’s not so great about it? 
 - Can be high in sugar so really have to read and compare labels carefully - Upsets my stomach/bowels if I have too much of it.  3. How do you think differently about dairy and non-dairy yogurt? - Dairy is for every day, tastes more neutral - and made from cow's milk (have tried goat and ewe's milk yoghurts and they taste really 'odd', more for special occasion or particular recipe.  - Non-dairy is healthier - I will drink almond or soya milk or have it my coffee - but non-dairy yoghurt I""ve never had so I can't really visualize so I guess I just have a lot of questions: is it going to be thick or thin? Smooth or dry? Is it going to be yellow or white or beige? What is it's sugar content? Protein content? 4. What attributes do you consider when choosing a yogurt - taste, flavor, texture, brand? 
 In this order:  sugar (low) and protein (high) content  - texture - price - flavor Once I've identified the best one against these attributes, I stick with it. When they stock out, I'll drive to another local supermarket to get it, and if they're out too,  I have my 'go to second choice' which is the Safeway Organic's brand. Try to always have several pots in the fridge to ride out any stock outs!! 5. What would justify paying a premium for a brand of yogurt? 
 I did pay a premium for ages for the Wallaby Organic brand. Double the price of our regular one. I would get it for my husband and I would use the cheaper Open Nature for me. I justified it by knowing he enjoyed it very much and I thought he hated the other kind and wouldn't eat it. And then one time he tried Open Nature and said 'not bad' so now we both eat that one! A healthier alternative would be a good justification to pay a premium. Brands I love: 
 DANACTIVE VANILLA FLAVOR (the strawberry one is AWFUL!) 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 It's tasty and good for me. Actually look forward to it as a little treat every morning. I alternate it with Yakult to vary the strains. 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 Yes. Because it makes me feel a lot less bloated and more 'regular' when I take it. Plus it taste AMAZING! :slight_smile:  
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 It's saying immune health - keeps your gut healthy.  
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 Not sure the shot size bottles are right. But the feel of the plastic (smooth but light) may not be a bad idea. 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 The shot bottles are great because this is a drinkable yogurt and it's perfectly designed to be swallowed in a few swigs without dribbling down your front. Easy to rinse and throw into the recycling. The lid is also great: stays in place as a seal but easy to peel off (as opposed to yakult where you have to 'faff' around with the strange little foil seal. 
 ----- 
 STRAUS GREEK YOGURT lo fat vanilla  (they were stocked out so picture is one of the plain variety)
 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 OMG!!! Have you tried it? This is the best yogurt EVER!! It's super smooth and quite runny and honestly I could just drink it out of the pot in one sitting. It really is that tasty. 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 Yes!!!! Because it's yogurt heaven. Unfortunately, it's not stocked everywhere so can be hard to find. Also, I wouldn't have it as my go to because it's higher in sugar than other brands and I eat such large volumes of yogurt a week. 
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Family owned creamery. They make the best ice-cream too. It's just delicious. Its yummy grass processed by a cow, the cow gets squeezed and out comes this delicious dairy product! 
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 ""Family owned"" , avoid 'creamery' and cow design obviously!! 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 I love the artisanal feel of the graphic: the cow with the organic swirl. And the traditional feel in the banner for 'straus'. 
 They color code they products so they're easier to find on the shelf - but I'm not sure about the brown/orange. 
 ------- 
 OPEN NATURE GREEK  0% YOGURT PLAIN  
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 Reliable brand that I purchase across several categories at Safeway and never lets me down. Not too pricey. Good value/quality ratio. Their coconut gelato is amazing! :slight_smile:  
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 Yes!!!! low sugar/hi protein content so ideal for my large volume consumption. It's our go-to yogurt. Used to buy the vanilla variant but then discovered it had cane sugar in it!! Not ideal when you're trying to reduce your carb load!! 
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Clean taste. Made locally with good values re sourcing ingredients and respecting the environment and the customer. (plus it says so on the packaging). 
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 Emulate: Made locally with good values re sourcing ingredients and respecting the environment and the customer.  
 Avoid: pretty crappy packaging design/color/logo. 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 - None of the design works for me other than the lid stays on properly even after several closing/opening. 
 - The foil seal is DIABOLICAL! You need a degree in packaging to get it off in one piece. I've got used to it but it still requires a deft hand. 
 ----------- 
 ORGANICS  NON FAT YOGURT PLAIN (Stocked out so took picture of vanilla variant instead) 
 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 Again reliable brand that I purchase across several categories at Safeway and never lets me down. Not too pricey. Good value/quality ratio. Their raw chicken's taste amazing (once you've cooked them obviously!) 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 Yes!!!! low sugar/hi protein content so a good alternative when our regular brand is stocked out. As you can see from the pictures, yogurt stock outs at my local Safeways is an issue. I have to plan around it by stocking up ahead of time (I wonder if we all do that... contributing to the stock outs...) 
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Clean, pure. What it says on the tin and nothing else. Affordable organic choices. 
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 It's actually a pretty cool logo and brand name: clean, easy to spot on the shelf. 
 The descriptor is also pretty legible so easy to tell the different variants apart. 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 - Not sure about the rest of the pack graphic, it's a bit blah.
 
 ------ 
 Brands I don't like: 
 CHOBANI GREEK YOGHURT FLIP individual pots 
 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 That's not yogurt, that's a muesli bar mascarading as yogurt. There are probably less calories in a hot chocolate! 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 No.  It's got too many bits and bobs in it.  
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Not sure. It's a bit chichi. It's all about flavor and indulgence? 
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 The compartimentalized packaging could be cool if you could add sliced almonds 
 Avoid the 'cover all surfaces with print' approach. It's really busy. 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 The clean lines of the logo - and the name too. 
 The compartiments in the packaging. 
 The individual portions. 
 ----- 
 DANNON OIKOS triple zero individual pots 
 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 So manufactured! It's coke zero as a yoghurt... and black packaging? What's that about? 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 No.  It's for boys who are gym bunnies. NFL logo does not fool me. None of the players I know would eat it (unless you paid them for it)!! 
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Have your cake and eat it too. It's got zero everything but trust us, it's going to taste amazing! 
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 The fruit stands out nicely on each pack to separate out the variants. 
 Avoid black  
 avoid triple zero  
 avoid NFL logo 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 Nice font on the logo 
 Nice big mention of protein content 
 None of the rest works well.... 
 ----- 
 SLINGSHOT probiotic 
 
 
 - What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 Who wants to drink their breakfast out of a plastic bottle? If you're that uninterested in food, then take it in pill form. Honestly!! 
 - Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 No.  I'd rather make a yogurt based breakfast from scratch. 
 - What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
 Healthy breakfast on the go. Remember 'shake and bake'? This is the equivalent: pour oats, shake bottle, pour down your throat: breakfast in under 10 seconds so you  don't have to waste any time....  
 - What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
 Avoid all of it, except for:  
 - the idea of 'pro biotic' 
 - the idea of combining the yogurt with other 'particulates' 
 - the idea of a drinkable format 
 - What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 Any packaging that requires an add on (in this case the ring of oats wrapped in plastic) is just POOR DESIGN!!! It makes me mad. It's like they spent all their time on the name for the brand and then used off the shelf packaging and had to improvise. Not cool. 1. Based on all you know and have shared about existing yogurt brands, what advice do you have for how Blue Diamond might develop a brand that you’d love to try? - It's got to taste good or you need to be able to add things to it to make it taste good - it needs to have an appealing consistency (slightly runny if in bottle), nice and smooth. - avoid gimmicky loud colors/flavors - make it sound authentically artisanal and therefore delicious: this is the yogurt made by the almond farmer's wife based on her granny's recipe, as opposed to the industrial/manufactured/processed variety - blue is not a very stand out color ,,,, consider branching out to something more natural. (think of Bertolli in the oil segment). 2. How might Blue Diamond ensure their  non-dairy  brand stands out (in a good way!)? 
 It's a really busy shelf with lots of colors and packaging shapes and variants thrown in, I noticed some almond yogurt in amongst them and it was completely drowned out (can't even remember the brand and it was only a few hours ago). 
 So the packaging needs to be done in such a way that it owns a decent chunk of the shelf. 
 3. What personality or tone of voice should it have? Do you have any examples? 
 I really like the direction of the Straus family owned creamery. It feels fresh and fun but with an artisanal/wholesomenes to it that really makes it stand out from the heavily processed/manufactured/shouty brands. It has a quiet confidence about it, it doesn't need to wear tons of makeup. It's the Subaru of dairy! All the people in the know drive a Subaru because nothing else is going to grip the road in rain/snow/ice/mud... only the city folks who want to look good but don't drive anywhere off track will get a  Range Rover Evoke convertible.... 
 4. What types of name would you like Blue Diamond to consider? CALIFIA: the mythical place after which California is named. AZIMAN: old Provencal for Diamond AMANDINE POLYAMOND BLO (With umlaut on the O) BLAU LAZULI FIVEPOINTS 5. What packaging design ideas do you think could really elevate this brand? 
 The compartmentalized pot, to add crunch/texture/flavor to the yogurt base (could be freeze dried raspberries or blanched sliced almonds etc...) The flatter packaging of NOOSA (wider than tall) so they can be stacked Or recyclable glass pots like OUI yogurt. How about a see-through plastic? Or at least some see-through aspects. Deliciously Healthy What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly?  Sorry, it doesn't make me think of anything. It's just a collection of meaningless words strung together. It could be for any product in any category.  What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why.   No strengths. I don't know what an almond yoghurt is supposed to be. Is almond the flavor? 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? See comments above. It doesn't tell me what it's made of. It doesn't tell me what it's going to look like or taste like. It doesn't tell me how it compares to other yoghurts, in what way it's better/healthier/tastier. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? It doesn't. It makes me switch off. (Sorry.) 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? Not really... What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? It's made in the US and made to a high (organic possibly?) standard. Possibly less industrial than other dairy products. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. - non-dairy yoghurt: point of difference, sounds healthier/better for my body - only from our California growers: notion of sourceability, it's not about cheapest ingredients - delicious creamy: I can visualize it and it makes me drool! This sounds like it could be really nice.  What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? - best tasting: compared to what? combined with non-dairy it sounds like an excuse like 'best tasting cocoa-free  chocolate cake"". Who wants that? - non-dairy plant based almondmilk: I find it very confusing to wrap my head around - isn't that the definition of almond milk? 
 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? - are the almonds the flavor or the yoghurt itself? - uncompromised goodness: in what way? flavor? ingredients? process? health benefits? 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? Tell me more about uncompromised goodness and what that means. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? This thing tastes better than regular yoghurt and is better for you. 
 What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. It's puts itself squarely against regular yoghurt and is confident it'll come out on top. 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? Is says 'delicious' and 'healthy' several times but doesn't elaborate. I want to know why and how it's delicious and healthy. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? - I want someone to describe/show me the taste and texture. - I want to know what makes it healthy. 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? Elaborate on 'healthy'. 1. In Part 1, some of you raised questions about whether or not it is right to use the term ‘yogurt’ when the product is non-dairy. If this product wasn’t a known as a yogurt, what else might it be called? cream, soft whip, custard, mousse, dessert, kefir Further Questions: 
 2. An idea that was shared is to call it “Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk”. What do you think of this? It sounds like it's full of bacteria!! :slight_smile: Not very appetizing.  3. What are the alternatives to “Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk”. How would you improve on it? How about pro-biotic (is it?) 1.  Where would you most like to see Blue Diamond's new product positioned on this quadrant and why?  On the upper half of contemporary axis, smack in the middle between serious and playful and well above SILK.  2. What advice do you have that could help Blue Diamond position their new brand where you  would most like to see it? Instagram feed - but not as a 'sponsored post'  - but as a recommendation from one of the physical trainers I follow who always give good nutrition/training tips. Safeway free give-aways: my supermarket's loyalty programme makes certain items free for a few days (let's say, 1 free yogurt with your grocery purchase) - I sometimes sample things I wouldn't otherwise even look at on the shelf. Food network recipes: if someone came up with highly rated recipes using this product instead of regular yoghurt (cucumber in yogurt sauce, yogurt muffins etc) Huffpost: it often comes up in my news feed so I'd pick up on a story/testimony on having tried this stuff and liking it. Pop-Up shop in SF: all about almonds and almond products - with a tie up with YELP. 3. How could they use colour, typeface, imagery and symbols to achieve this? Please upload images that would help us to understand the look and feel you’d like Blue Diamond to adopt. Noosa has a really nice balance of 'clean feel' with all the negative space and then a playful logo. Sigis also uses negative space and then features the pail as its icon: that's a nice direction: negative space + icon Below is a packaging idea for washing powder... but there's something really clean and transparent about it: 
 The one below: quite like the two versions but the one on left is a nice balance of negative space + icon + tasty cues. The one on the right is probably too extreme unless they did a special edition for a pop-up shop. The one below, colors wrong but there's a nice 'natural' 'local ingredients' feel to the packaging: it looks like it is filled up by hand one pot at a time. Simple pot, with a little label on the front. 'gourmet' is a nice touch too.  What I really like about this next one is the sleeve around the packaging - wouldn't it be cool to have it be the outside of an almond shell? Or a bag full of almonds (whatever Blue Diamond Growers transport them in)? 4. Would these design ideas work equally well for each of the three positioning descriptions? Are there any watch-outs for Blue Diamond to keep in mind? Could work for all three positionings. The main thing to keep in mind is how much of Blue Diamond and Almond Breeze is there in the design? Is it supposed to be in the same family? (or is it supposed to be 'from the lovely people at Almond Breeze'",Smoothie,
225797,Duncan,Lawrence,duncanalawrence@gmail.com,"1. When I think about yogurt, the first thing that I think about is breakfast - as it is when we usually eat yogurt. We used to eat it with granola, but have since shifted to eating it as-is from the container. It's not that granola isn't appealing anymore, but more that we are more and more rushed in the morning. I think that yogurt is a healthy food, and one that isn't considered a treat but instead a meal (especially when packaged as an individual serving). I think that yogurt has changed a lot over time, with more focus on health and less on packing it with sugar to make it palatable for children. From regular yogurt to greek yogurt, yogurt just feels better for me today than it did 20 years ago. Drinkable Yogurt - While living in Peru for one year, I basically lived off pineapple drinkable yogurt. It was the only thing that helped to keep my stomach in check with the food in Peru. As long as I had one container of drinkable yogurt every couple days, I would feel fine. I had never had drinkable yogurt before living in Peru, and it was strange to me at first. But after some time it became normal and comfortable. Drinkable Yogurt (squeezable) - Honestly, this isn't a thing for me. Drinkable yogurt, at best, is a children's treat, and one that is overly sugared and not healthy. There's a texture feeling that makes me uncomfortable about - not to mention this fear of cutting my lips on the plastic (like a cheap plastic spoon). It gives me a bad feeling about drinkable yogurt. 2. One thing I like about yogurt is just how simple it is to eat it. I open the fridge, peel back the top, and eat. I don't have to prepare anything - the only thing I need to consider is to make sure that I grab the right flavor (a flavor that I like and a flavor that hasn't been claimed by someone else in the house) and that it has not expired. Plus, you can get flavors of yogurt that feel local to the area, giving it the impression of shopping local. One thing that I don't like about yogurt is that it is probably not as healthy for me as I would like to think. I, for one, have always enjoyed the stir-in-the-bottom flavors, thinking that its more fresh and healthy because of it. However, my wife hates ones that you need to stir in, so I need to stir them for her before she eats them. 3. Non-diary Yogurt - My main question about non-dairy yogurt is why. Besides lactose intolerance, I wonder what the benefit is. Does it taste better? Is it healthier? Is it better for the environment? Can I do more with it? Those are questions that I don't know the answers to at this point.
 4. When considering yogurt, the first thing that I look for is brand: is it a brand that I've heard of, one that I trust, one that I think has my best interests in mind? Once I find a brand that fits, I look for texture: is there a greek option? My preference has shifted to greek-style yogurt, so if I find a brand that I like that doesn't have greek, I'm most likely not going to purchase it. After I find a brand with greek yogurt, I look at the flavors. I'm pretty open to most flavors, so this is a very low requirement for me. But in general I will try to look for flavors that feel as though they could be sourced locally. Vanilla is an easy one - even though it's likely not sourced locally, it feels blank enough to think that it is. Then the berries: blueberry, marionberry, raspberry. 5. Premium Yogurt - Absolutely. I pay a premium for yogurt each week - our choices are always more expensive than other options available. I am happy when my brand is on sale, but it doesn't stop me from making the purchase. Yogurt at my local super market - New Seasons 
 When my wife and I go grocery shopping, we usually go to New Seasons. It's a local chain that is more on the upscale side than not. Our local shop is great - kinda small, but a great selection of healthy foods. They even have a bar upstairs with a handful of drinks on tap, all along an outdoor patio. What could be better than that? The above photo is of the three double-door sections that have yogurt. There is only one aisle of refrigeration, so this is a lot of yogurt for the limited real estate. Yogurt I don't like - Fage This yogurt has never been in my fridge.
 I have never considered purchasing Fage, and never want to. It feels very, very corporate to me, without any connection to my own interest. Compared to everything else available, this looks impersonal, basic, and without personality. I have no reason to pick it out of the other options. Blue Diamond should take note of making sure to not be so bland as to be looked over and not considered. Yogurt I don't like - Liberté Liberté has all the signs of being a yogurt I would like - but the shine on the yogurt honestly makes me not want to pick it out. There's a feeling of waste associated with that. I already try to avoid waste with yogurt, though I do purchase single servings so I am well aware of the waste that I am creating and contributing to with my yogurt. But adding this shine feels more wasteful to me, feels showy for the sake of being showy. I have never tasted it, but unless it was absolutely amazing - above and beyond any other flavor - I do not believe I would enjoy this brand. Blue Diamond should avoid being shiny for shiny's sake - or, if the demographic support just wants shiny, then be very shiny! But it's noticeable, so make a choice with it. Also, I would avoid using flowers and flavors like french lavender - that sounds like a bathroom scent to me, not a yogurt flavor. Yogurt I don't like - Drinkable 
 Siggi's and Chobani are brands that I believe are for adults - but these just look like yogurts for kids. I really don't like how they are merchandised, and unless my kid really wanted some, I would avoid these at all costs. If Blue Diamond is going to create a drinkable version, work on how it is packaged so it doesn't just get shoved in the middle of all the other yogurts. Make it stand out and stand on its own. Yogurt I like - Tillamook Tillamook Farm Style Greek Yogurt is what finds its way into our refrigerator each and every week - probably 12-15 individual servings. It is a local brand that is showcasing local ingredients to the Pacific Northwest, at a price that is higher than most but can still be competitive. Blue Diamond should consider how they find their way into people's lives. Don't just be any yogurt, but be a yogurt that customers understand how can fit into their lives. Yogurt I like - Ellenos I'm on the fence about Ellenos. On the one hand, having a completely clear container shows that they are willing to bare it all to the world, believing in their ingredients. But it also looks like jam, which is kinda strange. I have never tried it, but this stands out so much more than the other yogurts that I am intrigued - if I were trying to decide between Tillamook and another yogurt, I would seriously consider trying this one. Blue Diamond should consider how to differentiate themselves to make people stop and consider - they may avoid it the first couple times, but be apparent enough to keep the interest alive. Other Yogurt - Kite Hill This was the first time that I saw non-dairy alternatives. The one that grabbed my eye was Kite Hill - compared to the Silk versions, it felt like something that I would purchase. They did a great job of referencing the almond while still focusing on the ingredients incorporated within the yogurt. 1. I think that Blue Diamond should focus on health and offering an alternative to the other yogurts out there. People understand yogurt and what it is, so you don't need to explain that. Celebrate the difference - the almond focus. 2. Most of the non-dairy yogurt that I saw in the grocery store didn't show off much that it was a non-dairy brand. I think that Blue Diamond, being an almond company, can really own that in a completely different, authentic way than anyone else in the market. I think that the almond focus needs to be loud and there - showcasing what makes their yogurt special. 3. Personality should be confident yet helpful. Blue Diamond has the almond side down, so own that, but then acknowledge that the yogurt side of things is a new adventure. Some exploration and adventure, but with the confidence to move into the area. A little Indiana Jones - educated, well-based, but heading into a new adventure. 4. Don't avoid that the company behind the yogurt is Blue Diamond - celebrate it.   - Always Almond  - More  - Blue  - Yum  - Delicious 5. Unless people are looking for a non-dairy alternative, they need to be convinced that the yogurt is still yogurt. Maybe consider showcasing that it is still, at its base, a yogurt - it could be a clear container that showcases what's inside (don't hide anything, be confident), or even a clear top with an opaque container. Maybe an almond-shape (teardrop) shape container that is merchandised to look like normal yogurt from the front, but when you pick it up you can see the shape - especially if the top is clear. Uncompromised Goodness This makes me think that if I eat this, I can check some health-focused boxes of my daily food intake. The emphasis on calcium makes me think that I don't need milk or a calcium supplement if I am eating this, which makes it health-focused. Ready to go throughout the day tells me that I should be eating this in the morning. That's a good way to influence when I eat this - and helps me plan out how to eat the yogurt. This does mean that I probably won't eat it as much throughout the day - but in general I wouldn't, anyways (expect for recently where we have been eating yogurt as afternoon snacks). Vitality is an interesting word. If I eat this, I guess I can go out and hike! Or go on some other adventure! Ready to take on the day! This is not a word that I would usually use. ""The best tasting non-dairy yogurt which will leave you feeling full of vitality."" Does that mean other better tasting yogurts won't leave me feeling full of vitality? That sentence seems to suggest other, better-tasting options are out there - though I might not feel so good after eating them. Who decided this is the perfect light and smooth texture? Did I? Did my friends? Did someone in a lab? I like the word uncompromised. That suggests that this yogurt was created from only choice almonds from Blue Diamond, and that Blue Diamond is the producer of the best almonds. It is a word to suggest struggle and triumph, as opposed to luxuriously, which does not necessarily represent anything to be proud of (not that you shouldn't be proud, but uncompromised suggests value). Using the word growers brings the people back to the product, which is a nice touch. The reminder that there are people who grow Almonds, which are then used for this product, helps make me feel good about the purchase. Not as good as a one-for-one like Toms, but definitely better than thinking that it's a completely automated process without any impact on the community. Depending on the branding, saying ""We only use Blue Diamond almonds"" seems like an obvious answer. If you don't emphasize the Blue Diamond side of the branding, then this connection will be less obvious and be perceived as having more meaning. This first sentence is my favorite so far. Ooh - anytime of day makes this sound like a treat! I'm in. Though that might mean that I won't eat this often, but instead only get it if I'm treating myself to something nice. This is because there isn't much that I eat all during the day. But if you were to put this together with some marketing collateral that showed how people were enjoying this, I think that I could better imagine this within my day-to-day. This makes me think of freezing the yogurt to be frozen yogurt - could be a nice treat! Luxuriously makes this sound expensive. It probably is, since it is premium-ish, but there is something to having to say luxurious instead of just being luxurious. That's another hint that it's a treat rather than a daily staple. A luxury is something that I should only indulge in occasionally - and if it's more often, then I must be modest about it. I do prefer that this doesn't say plant-based, since the vegetarian angle supposed by it is not for everyone. This description is less of a position than the other. 1. I understand the concern, but it's similar in that I eat Just Mayo ""mayonnaise."" It may not be actual mayo, but it's the substitute for what I want and therefore it fits. It's more of a category than a product, in my mind.
 If I had to think of a different name for the product, then I suppose it could be called an almond byproduct (ew), an almond breakfast (too limiting), almond treat. But really - yogurt is perfect. 2. No. The word cultured does not make me think ""delicious,"" and I brew beer and bake. It's fine to have something be cultured, but I don't think that it should be used to describe the product at that level. It would be fine for people who love it, but it's going to be a limited group who gravitate towards it in the beginning. 3. Other options: Dairy-free almondmilk yogurt-substitute Almondmlik yogurt substitute Almondmilk treat Almondmilk delight Almondmilk meal 1. I would gravitate more towards the playful and contemporary side for Blue Almond. It shows that this is a new thing, giving off the California feel and architecture, with friendly feelings of the west coast. I think that it's the place that still has some room to grow, the ability to tell a story and have it resonate with customers.
 2. Areas like serious and traditional are full and without a lot of opportunity for change - if you are looking at those products, you have an idea what you want already and will likely go for the same brand over and over again. However, on the contemporary and playful side you will find customers who are intrigued by something new - they may not purchase the first time, but they'll keep an eye out to learn about the product. 3.  Almond trees, highlighting the plant, the green, the health, the vitality. 
 California architecture, browns, light, honesty, openness, embracing of the space - with a bit of money to do it. Ocean, water, and breathing in the fresh air. By being more on the contemporary side of things, the container and branding should embrace California lifestyle and all the feel good that it brings. Focus on the idea of getting out and getting the most of the day, embracing the atmosphere and environment, all the while enjoying a treat that helps you get through the day.
 4. Depending on the product positioning, the yogurt itself can be positioned in different places. If you go with the California theme, then playful and contemporary make sense. If you are focusing on the healthy side, then more towards serious and traditional (a la Activia). I don't think that straight traditional is a good fit unless you are very concerned about people being able to understand what the product is for.",Smoothie,
234987,Danielle,Guercio,danielleguercio@gmail.com,"1. Yogurt is more than a snack, its an ingredient that provides a very specific flavor and texture to what you eat it with. I dont purchase too many big brands unless making a recipe, yogurt isnt so much daily for me, though sometimes in hot summer months i will have it as a snack. Big brands (to me) are Fage and stony brook farms? (Organic brand). Fage represents the rise of Greek yogurt to me which changed my perception of yogurt altogether. 
 
 
 2. I love thick yogurts and almost always get 2% and higher, preferring full fat. I LOATHE diet and low fat yogurt which tastes horrible. Sometimes I can stand the 0% Fage if its with something sweet or for cooking. Also, flavored yogurts are equally gross, especially with non-sugar sweeteners. Yogurt is amazing because of its tangy dairy flavor, which doesn’t always have to come from dairy but is best illustrated by dairy yogurt. It’s not so great when its treated like fruit snacks or cookies, its better when its fresh and custom- accessorized. 
 
 
 3. Non dairy yogurt can be downright fantastic. The texture isnt always there, but the flavor can often be even more fermented and complex than dairy yogurt which has a pretty standard taste. Non dairy yogurt has a chance to take over if done right and priced right. 
 
 
 4. Im all taste and have brand loyalty with yogurt because so many brands are just OK and not very tasty. 
 
 
 5. Premium yogurt is either super fancy non dairy stuff like coconut cult or extremely fresh like Ronnybrook, NYC’s ‘local’ yogurt company. Ill pay if the mood strikes me. Brand 1: Fage Greek Yogurt 
 2. Love that its thick and creamy, less boring than other yogurts. Cons: too tempting to get the full fat 
 3. 100% and many times. Because its always good and always works for snacks or recipes 
 4. Simple, direct messaging, no over the top colors or messaging 
 5.if emulating, try to emulate their efforts tho develop a product thats selling because its perfect not because its marketed well 
 6.i like the simplicity and light colors, they were ahead of the millennial design curve. I hate the actual brand name logo it kind of squashes the lightness of the other elements 
 Brand 2: Chobani 
 2. Chobani is the sub for Fage. Not crazy about it and think they generally go overboard. But they fight off Alex Jones and thats admirable. The shops dont interest me at all. 
 
 3. Just because there was no Fage or Trader Joe’s brand. 
 4. I think they do their own thing but still follow major branding protocol, kind of bland.  
 5.dont. Too recognizeable branding, would look like a copycat. Avoid going ape with flavors. 
 6. Its just OK. It’s not overly interesting but does look miles better than most yogurt companies. 
 Brand 3: silk almond 
 2. i like that its non dairy and semi attractive packaging 
 3. Havent bought this yet or tasted 4. Silk is a non dairy icon. They really got it going for the mainstream. 5. Obviously compare flavors and textures and make sure you’re better 6. Don’t know about taste but i like the packaging which throws back to the other products by the brand but is still different.  Brand 4: la yogurt PLAIN 2. Ive bough this when super broke. It’s not my fav but its suitable. I used to buy the flavored ones for snacks when they were on sale and I couldn’t afford Greek yogurt.  
 3. Just because there was no Fage or i was broke.  4.their packaging is heinous. Flavor is ok. They def appease my inner child but it’s been years since i bought those kinds of yogurts 5. Not a good example of the future 6. Its decent. It fills a need, its smartly priced.  
 
 Brand 5: coconut cult 2. Way too expensive for daily life. So delicious though, and it grows. 3. Only bought for special occasions 4. Marketing to fitness and health nuts. that in of itself does not appeal to me. 5. Flavor but not texture is great. It’s not thick but incredible tasting. Heavy on the fermented flavors. Too expensive to use for recipes, best for a week of luxury yogurt consumption. 6. I’d buy again if I was better off.  
 
 DON’T LIKE 
 Brand1: dannon light and fit 2. Would never ever buy. Artificial sweetener is my nightmare taste. Mixed with dairy is like actually making me sick to think about hahahah 3. Never  4. So gross and doesn’t do anything for real health 5. Just hell no.  6. It’s ugly and borderline fat shamey.  
 
 Brand 2: silk soy 2. The idea of soy yogurt is gross 3. Nope 4. Branding is boring on this one, the almonds looks way more enticing. 5. Meh. I would avoid. Looks too much like chobani 6. not interesting at all. Soy yogurt sounds gross 1. Focus on TASTE and quality above all other things. Try to be sustainable. ‘Health’ is relative and yogurt is a fat which can be good for you so avoid being about ‘health’ if possible 
 2. Clean and modern packaging, as little waste as possible, earth friendly, delicious 3. Fun and not only focused on diets and bummer stuff. Serious but also cute 4. Something snappy but tied to original brand. If the nuts are good the yogurt should be good too. 5. Glass. Too much plastic in the world. Would make it premium. Glasses could get a second life in peoples homes which = free impressions. Uncompromised Goodness 1. Taste is mentioned but not described. Non dairy driven 4 times, health statement too broad 
 Related Questions: 
 2. Touches on taste slightly, clear about non dairy (but is it vegan? Make that clear 
 3.no description just descriptors, too focused on health, calcium is just one part of calcium diet requirements and if no vitamin d it means nothing, statement is too vague 
 4.what does it taste like, is it filling because of texture, why does it make you feel great because its healthy tasty or both 
 5. Too wellness mumbo jumbo not specific 1. Taste taste taste. No mention of taste.
 Related Questions: 
 2. Refers to premium source, origin is clear. 
 3. again too much vague descriptors like uncompromised and smooth. Non dairy and plant based mean the same thing so its repeating the idea five times throughout: non dairy yogurt, we only use almonds, non dairy, plant based, almond milk yogurt. BUT WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKEEEEE!!!  
 4. Taste, texture, what the trees look like, the sun conditions of california that make their nuts superior, why do we care that blue diamond is making almond yogurt 
 5. More craft, more distinction 1. its too much about texture. No mention of flavor other than delicious, nonspecific. It feels too simplistic and vague.  
 Related Questions: 
 2. Minimal. I guess thats what appeals to some people when choosing yogurt, and I’d likely fall under that umbrella. Plain is a good thing when it comes to yogurt 
 3. add more colorful descriptions, like about the vanilla, the nuts. Don’t repeat phrases 
 4.what does it actually taste like. Is it thick or runny, how does it look on a spoon. Is there a plain version without vanilla for cooking 
 5. less linear to the quip about healthy daytime and more abstract and on-brand for the idea that it comes from nuts. Is it nutty? Is it tangy? Etc. 1. Almond cream, yogurt alternative, tree cream, 2. Why even mention dairy? It’s just too repetitive and almost adversarial 3. Cultured almond milk, das it. 1. Right in the middle. An established brand should maintain some of its aesthetic even when modernizing. A photo of the actual source makes a great signal. 2. Just dont lie or inflate health claims. Don’t even call it healthy if it isnt. It’s frustrating to think natural means heal;thy but nuts and yogurt are full of fat and sugar. Fat and sugar are necessary and healthy by definition, but diabetes and heart disease are also real and prevalent, so don’t make it a slip up for people who are vulnerable to simplified marketing.  3. Play off original logo and design. Use the color palette. That exists with tweaks for current trends or an inverse theme just to make a distinction 4. Those descriptions are vague and therefor don’t tie themselves to any design principle. It could be literally anything as long as you dont put a cow on it",Smoothie,
198761,Flávia,Oliveira,flaoliveiraberenguel@gmail.com,"I've always enjoyed yogurt, and I drink it since I was a kid! My mother always bought for me and my sister to take before lunch and sometimes as a snack. So, besides being a tasty drink, practical and healthy, it brings me good memories and good feelings. There are several companies that sell yoghurt in the market under different brands such as: Chobani, Stonyfield, Yoplait and Dannon. Each brand has its own characteristics, but the brands I choose to consume, to me, represent an extension of my identity and my personality. What I love most about yogurt is taste, texture and practicality. It is a product that I can consume anywhere, at any time. I do not like yoghurts with a very thin consistency (unless, of course, the drinkable type) and those with a very high preservative content. Particularly, I think non-dairy yogurts are much healthier and more nutritious than dairy yogurts, since they are made from a vegetable source rather than an animal source. The attributes that I most consider when choosing a yogurt are taste, texture and ingredients. The more natural ingredients the product has, the better, and if it is, at the same time tasty, even better! Under these conditions, I would certainly agree to pay a premium price for a yogurt brand. SILK:  I like that brand, mainly because yogurts are made from non-GMO soy, not genetically modified soy. They are also gluten-free and have low fat and sugar content. When I eat yogurt, I can feel the real flavor of the fruit, not an artificially sweetened product. They have a very creamy texture and a real consistency of yogurt. I particularly like the flavors of Blueberry, Peach Mango, Black Cherry and Tropical Pineapple. I buy at least once a week here at home and usually use them as a snack / sweet treat with granola. I think the main message the brand wants to pass on is that its products are silky, creamy, smooth, tasty and versatile. Like Silky, Blue Diamond could also focus on making, mainly, a yogurt with non-GMO ingredients. I think the label on the yoghurt packaging of the brand (including the logo) communicate very well the image that the brand wants to pass about their products. 
 SO DELICIOUS:  It is a brand that has yogurts of various flavors and with a superior nutritional value, compared to other brands of non-dairy yogurts (higher protein content and lower sugar content). Still, there is a version of almond based yogurts that have live probiotic cultures, which further increases the nutritional value of the product. I eat yogurts of this brand often, especially that version with probiotics. I think the brand wants to convey an image of a really delicious product (living up to the name), versatile and healthy. Blue Diamond could also develop a version of yogurt rich in probiotics, with various flavors and low sugar content. I find the yoghurt packaging design quite attractive and in addition, the brand always uses materials from renewable sources in the manufacture of packaging. DAIYA:  I really love this brand and I buy products from different categories regularly, including, of course, the yogurts that are delicious and creamy. It is a brand that specializes in plant-based and dairy free foods! The yogurts are made with coconut cream and pea protein, are loaded with real fruits, probiotics and plant-based protein. The brand encourages a dairy free feeding, and therefore healthier, but without giving up the taste of food, and I think that's what Blue Diamond should look for when developing and manufacturing their yogurt. The yogurt packs of the brand have an attractive label and design, making it easy to identify the yoghurt flavor. In addition, they are sustainable and eco-friendly. I did not find the product available for purchase in the supermarket, but I took a picture of some that was here in my refrigerator. Almond Dream:  I bought a yogurt of this brand only once to try it and I did not like it, especially texture and flavor, which resembles a poorly made pudding. Yogurts also have a very high amount of sugar. I think the brand tries to convey an image that its products are versatile, healthy, soft and creamy. For me, after the nutritional value, texture and flavor are the most important in a yogurt, and when these are not good it is easily noticed, and I think that's what Blue Diamond should pay attention to. As for the packaging design, I find the design of the coconut-based version more attractive (more premium) than the almond-based version. Activia (Dairy Yogurt):  I put an image of the brand ""Activia"", but I mean all yogurts based on animal milk (dairy yogurts). Despite having attractive packaging and brands selling as if it were a healthy product, this type of yogurt is much less healthy than non-dairy and has a very strange taste. I think Blue Diamond should never think about making dairy yogurt, for the good of people's health and the planet. Blue Diamond should develop a brand of yogurt as healthy and natural as possible, that is, without GMO ingredients, low amounts of sugar, fat and artificial ingredients and use natural thickeners and sweeteners. 
 
 
 It would also be interesting to add live probiotic cultures, which would further increase the nutritional value of the product. All this without losing the taste! The texture should be creamy, silky and smooth. The brand could also launch different flavors, including those that have not yet been released, and add some benefit that differentiates and highlights the other brands that are in the market, either with regard to the design of the product or the composition of the product itself. The brand should position itself as authentic, responsible, concerned with the health and well-being of the people, in offering a tasty but healthy product. Among the possible names for this brand could be: Blue Diamond Almond Dairy-Free Yogurt, Blue Diamond Healthy Yogurt, Blue Diamond Dairy-Free Cultured Almond Milk, Blue Diamond Healthy & Delicious Dairy-Free Yogurt and Blue Diamond Non-Dairy Yogurt Creamy, Tasty and Healthy. The packaging of the brand's yogurt should have an attractive and inviting label and design that really looks like a tasty and healthy product. Also, it could be sustainable and eco-friendly. The brand could also launch drinkable versions of yogurt, since today most of what is on the market (among types of non-dairy yogurts) are versions to eat with spoon (spoonable). Deliciously Healthy I liked this description of positioning, but I still think it can be improved. It is good and quite interesting for Blue Diamond to mention the sources of vitamins and minerals (and the proportion of each one) provided by yogurt, and how they can be beneficial to health! Including, one thing I missed was the fact that I did not find in the descriptions any mention of yogurt being made with live-active cultures, which benefits digestive health, among other things.
 
 
 
 
 As in the other descriptions, I would also like to know if the yogurt is GMO and gluten-free, what kind of sweetener was used, the proportion of vitamins and minerals it provides, and whether any artificial ingredients or preservatives have been used. Also, for me it is not clear in the description of why yogurt provides vitality, Blue Diamond could explain this better. Again, the brand needs to focus on showing the consumer the differentials of this product and why they should buy it. I think, for example, if the brand mentions in the description that your yogurt provides ""X"" percent more calcium than a dairy yogurt or that ""X"" percent of the recommended daily amount would be a different and more attractive way to position yourself. I do not find this positioning description appealing or that arouses curiosity and interest in knowing more about the product. The fact that Blue Diamond uses almonds from its California growers, in my view may add value to the product, but it is not a type of key information that consumers are looking for in a yogurt, much less is what will differentiate you from others who are in the market. What I as a consumer of this type of product would like to know is the differential of this product, in what ways it can benefit me (especially my health), why should I choose it instead of the others. Also, what kind of sweetener has been used, is GMO-free and gluten-free? Were artificial ingredients or preservatives used? Is it a source of some essential vitamin or mineral? I think this description of positioning has to focus more on the product itself and on the benefits and differentials that this product can offer the consumer. What would lead the consumer to choose this yogurt instead of similar ones? This positioning description highlights a healthy, non-dairy, almond-based yoghurt that is delicious, creamy and can be eaten at any time of the day. In short, a yogurt that is healthy but at the same time delicious and practical.
 
 
 This description does not say much about the yogurt, just the basics (delicious, creamy, practical). It is a description widely used by other brands that sell the same type of product. Blue Diamond should position itself differently than other brands, and highlight something that differentiates your yogurt from the similar ones that are on the market. 
 
 
 I would like to know the main vitamins and minerals that this yogurt offers, if it's GMO-free, gluten-free and which sweetener used. Blue Diamond could mention why a non-dairy yogurt like this is healthier than a milk yogurt or why your yogurt is healthier and how it can help improve people's health by giving them more vitality and energy throughout the day. First, I do not see any problem in calling the product ""yogurt"", because the origin of the word itself refers to a dense, creamy product. But if this product were not known as yogurt, it could be called: 
 
 
 - Dairy-free probiotic drink 
 - Cultured Almond Milk 
 - Blue Diamond creamy & tasty drink 
 - Creamy & Tasty cultured almond milk I think the name ""Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk"" is redundant, because the word ""almond milk"" already implies that it is a non-dairy beverage. I would add some word before ""cultured almond milk"" that resembled the characteristics of a yogurt, such as creamy, dense. For example, ""Creamy & Tasty Cultured Almond Milk"". I do not see much of the brands innovating in this market for non-dairy yogurts, either in the positioning of the brand itself or in relation to the products themselves (especially in the case of packaging). So I'd like to see the new Blue Diamond product positioned in the first quadrant (between contemporary and fun). I would like to see different packages (different designs and formats, without giving up the practicality), with fun and cheerful colors, letters in a more holistic format, images that refer to a creamy and tasty product and an easy way to identify the flavor of the product. I wish there was a drinkable version of the product (no need to spoon to eat), easy to carry and consume, anytime, anywhere. The three positioning descriptions have in common a healthy, delicious, creamy, and practical product, so these design ideas would work well for all three descriptions. Easy identification of the flavor. 
 Drinkable and practical version of non-dairy yogurt. The image on the packaging refers to a creamy product.

225801,Jeanie,Demoss,jsheyngis3@yahoo.com,"1. When I think of the yogurt category I think of dairy yogurts, kid yogurts, drinkable yogurts, and alternative yogurts.  2. I love the flavors of yogurt, that it is good for you, that it has protein, that it is light, everyone likes it in the family so it is a healthy treat. I don't always love the texture, the thickness, the fruit on the bottom, sugar.  3. I think of dairy products not being good for me because they are sugary and my body doesn't like the way it feels on dairy that is filled with antibiotics. I think of non dairy products as being much better for me, healthier, and a good for me snack. I think of dairy alternatives as being good protein.  4. What it is made of is the number one!Taste, flavor, consistency, brand only because of familiarity, when there is a new brand that is dairy free..I always give it a try in my favorite 1 or 2 flavors!  5. What is is made out, good taste, organic, sugar comes from honey or fruit not added sugar. a glass jar (use a mason jar and have different sizes!)  From the previous question....I could not get the images and the text together so I will just answer both on here. 
 1. For the brands I like I chose Kite Hill and Forager. 
 2.  What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? Kite Hill is very smooth and has a lot of fruit flavor without being too sweet. I really like the texture of it and the flavors. And I love that it is non dairy.  
 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? Yes, it has! This is one of the brands I buy most often because I like the flavors and everyone in my family enjoys it and that it does not taste any different, even better and less sour than regular milk based yogurt.  
 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? I associate healthy with this brand, as well as just alternative yogurt but not compromising on flavor, consistency or flavor.  
 5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? They should emulate the sweetness level, not being too sweet but definitely not being too sour which I fi 
 
 
 1. The next brand I chose was Foreger.  
  2. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? I love that this brand is made out of cashews, their flavors, texture and that they are a good balance of sweetness.  
 
 
 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? No, but they are out of the flavors I like all the time so I have not bought it yet, but have tried it.  
 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? This brand is trying to say that they are a high end yogurt with an alternative base.  
 5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? Some of the flavors. I like the cashew but I know it is fattier and not as good for us as almond or coconut based so I would maybe avoid the higher mold count nuts and fattier nuts to avoid the yogurt being too fatty.  
 6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? I think its simple, a little busy but not too bad and gives all the important information. It does not necessarily stand out as a nut based yogurt like Kite Hill does.  
 6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? It should have something on it to stand out as a nut based yugurt.  
 As far as the two yogurt brands that I do not like is Dannon and Yoplait. I do not like that they are dairy based, they have a high sugar content and they both taste too sour. They are trying to become healthier by writing Activia on it but I think it tastes bad and it does not make me want to be active or heal my gut like it claims. It is also hard to get over both of these brands because they are so main stream and have always been so high in sugar content. I think they are too bright and somewhat annoying looking so I would not emulate anything from their packaging or their flavors.  
 1. Based on all you know and have shared about existing yogurt brands, what advice do you have for how Blue Diamond might develop a brand that you’d love to try? I would advise Blue Diamond to stick to being an almond brand and not veer into other nuts because they are not as healthy for us anyways because there is a higher mold count in peanuts and cashews. I would stick with almond and maybe coconut but coconut based yogurts tend to be a little more runny and I don't love the texture as much. I would also make sure that they sugar is coming from the fruit or just honey. 
 2. How might Blue Diamond ensure their  non-dairy  brand stands out (in a good way!)? Use organic, raw nuts to make their yogurt, less sugar, smooth consistency and texture. Interesting flavors, like longenberry, instead of just the standards.  3. What personality or tone of voice should it have? Do you have any examples? It should be an active personality, an enthusiastic tone, a personality of a person who has a goal in mind, and that is motivated to get that goal achieved.  4. What types of name would you like Blue Diamond to consider? I do not think they need to change their name because they are known for having good almonds. Maybe blue diamond smooth, but it doesn't need a name change.  5. What packaging design ideas do you think could really elevate this brand? I think just sticking with a white background, and just their color in their title, and having a simple image of an almond with the flavor written in. Simple is good ! It would be nice to have a lid on it so it can be covered up if not done with. I like it being in a glass jar too because it looks high end and way better in glass then plastic. It would also be fun to have almonds be poured in as an extra crunch, that can be optional or with the yogurt. Healthy Vitality 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? 
 Does it have protein, if so, it should be mentioned and how much per serving. The description makes me think about it being a lot healthier source of calcium and gut health. 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. 
 The strengths are that it is non dairy, light, plant based, good source of calcium, smooth texture. 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? 
 I don't like the word VITALITY to describe your feelings or anything that has to do with food. I would much rather hear feeling light on your feet and energetic. Helps get me through any cravings or hunger between meals. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? How many grams of protein in a cup, how many almonds in a cup? How much of our daily calcium is it providing? 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? The changes of adding protein will provide a great snack or part of a meal for those who are looking to be healthy, full, and dairy free or even just reduce dairy in their lives and still get great taste, protein and calcium. 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid?  Protein, calcium and I love the word uncompromising but not goodness. I would say uncompromising taste or nutrition.  2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. Plant based, non dairy, creamy, smooth, Blue Diamond almonds, uncompromised. 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? Unless it is local, I do not need to hear that it is from California because it doesn't mean anything to me, unless there is some reason like the sun is better for the almonds being sweeter or whatever, and that I would need to have explained. It does not say anything about the healthy aspect of it or the protein, calcium benefits which we look for in non dairy yogurt. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? Just digging into the health benefits so that they are not overlooked. 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? Adding the health benefits that this yogurt provides for us. 1. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid?  It makes me think about protein, what are the benefits. It is plain and general but it's not bad. 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. The strengths are almond milk, smooth, creamy, non dairy.  3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? Does not give a lot of detail. Luxurious also is not the best description for food...it is more of a car or hair/skin hair. It could over come it by using words like high quality, on another level of all other yogurts.  4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? How much protein, how much calcium, why else it is good for me.  5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? Protein amount, calcium amount, benefits. Changes can make it more of a healthy treat, providing you with more energy and plant based protein. 1. I think that as long as it is labeled dairy free or almond based, it is good to use yogurt as part of the name because then people have an understanding of what the consistency and texture will be like.  2. I don't like this name because cultured does not make me think of it being smooth or creamy for some reason. I also don't want to think of it as an almondmilk because it makes me think it will be runny and not enough creaminess.  3. I would improve it by saying Dairy Free almond yogurt or snack. 1. Where would you most like to see Blue Diamond's new product positioned on this quadrant and why? 
 I would like to see Blue Diamond more on the serious contemporary side with some changes. The reason is because they have been around for a while and they take their almonds seriously so it makes sense to see them a little more contemporary since it is a newer trend...the idea of almond based or non dairy. 
 2. What advice do you have that could help Blue Diamond position their new brand where you would most like to see it? I would maybe have reusable glass jars so the quality of the container was better, see through as well. This way they are also showing they are environmentally friendly and responsible. I would like to just see a pretty plain container with an image of the almond like it is is Kite Hill, but see through and glass packaging with a lid. It would be cool to have them in two sizes so that is where the lid would come in handy. 
 3. How could they use colour, typeface, imagery and symbols to achieve this? Please upload images that would help us to understand the look and feel you’d like Blue Diamond to adopt. The use of color should be minimum because that represents minimum ingredients and minimum advertising overload. I like when it is a clean simple look with the details needed and an image of the flavor or almonds. Keeping the background white and maybe just having a strip across the bottom that is different color based on the flavor. 
 4. Would these design ideas work equally well for each of the three positioning descriptions? Are there any watch-outs for Blue Diamond to keep in mind? They would work well with any of the 3 designs.",Smoothie,
198803,Enza,Scialfa ,smmiley73@hotmail.com,"I :heart::heart::heart: Yogurt!!! I find that yogurt as a category is wide and extensive.  From countless varieties, textures, flavours, drinkables, fat contents, lactose free, etc.  Yogurt is sure to please just about everyone from toddlers, kids, teens, adults and seniors.   
 I love yogurt because of the varieties.  I can eat yogurt everyday without eating the same texture, or flavour twice.  The options are endless...I love that yogurt also meets my dairy intake while supplying me with the calcium and protein my body needs.  The only thing that isn’t great is the fact that it requires refrigeration and can not sustain shelf life..   i have only ever eaten dairy yogurts.  However, I would love to try non dairy yogurt.  I already drink almond milk daily and love the versatility of it.  The nutritional aspect is great because it provides me with the protein I need throughout the day, and the fact that it has a long shelf life is the bonus.  No need to worry about refrigeration.   
 When choosing a yogurt taste is key.  I will only eat it if it tastes great.  Flavour is number two,  flavour has to be rich and delicious.  I don’t care soo much about brand, if it tastes great, I don’t care who makes it.  I don’t mind paying a little extra for great taste.  But taste is key for me.  If flavour and taste are exceptional than paying more is no issue.  I live to enjoy great food! So Liberte is my favourite yogurt at the moment.  It has a variety of exotic flavours with varing consistencies.  The Lemon curd bottom filled is my first choice followed by the Vanilla bean Greek yogurt.  Always creamy and never disappoints 
 
 
 A private label Such as President Choice Skylar Icelandic style is another favourite with triple the consistency of greek yogurt and double the protein and calcium. This is my after work out yogurt of choice. :heart: It. 
 
 
 
   My third choice for variety, flavour and convience is Oikos.  A rich greek yogurt that blends exotic flavours and super grains to provide ones diet with the calcium, protein and fibre that you need.  I usually but this as a on the go snack to eat in the car or at work. 
 These brands are all special in their own way.  I love that each brand makes a variety of flavours and sizes to meet various serving needs.   
 I am NOT a fan of these yogurt tubes and they have never made it to my refrigerator.  I believe they are filled with sugar and only gear to the likes of young children.  I love natural, wholesome flavours with the highest nutritional value available.  I find that this brand is trying to trick parents into thinking that these sugar filled yogurts are a healthy option.  I disagree! 
 Blue Diamond has to think of emulating the consistency of a rich yogurt.  Provide options of flavours and texture all while providing nutritional goodness.  I think being true to the ingredients will help Blue Diamond, stay away from additives and preservatives.  Keep ingredients simple 
 I love compact packaging, easy to grab and go.  Lids that fasten well and stay shut.  Smoothie shaped bottles that have drinkable yogurts are great and convenient.  Stay away from tubes Blue Diamond is famous for their almonds, therefore Blue Diamond needs to emphasize the goodness and nutritional value of their almond based yogurt.  The fact that its lactose dairy free is a strong selling point as well.  It needs to have a fun, relaxed tone, not too UPTIGHT, approachable.  The friend everyone wants to have!   I like Pure Protein, Blue D, YogurtD’s I love packaging that is compact and easy to carry,  do something different like add a plastic spoon or stick.  This definitely elevates the brand. Healthy Vitality this description is also intriguing but I have trouble around the word “vitality”.  Food provides us with a source of ENERGY, in my opinion energy should replace vitality.  There is no mention of the source of protein almonds provide, that too, should be included.   I like how the description emphasizes the taste, textures and calcium this yogurt provides, The weakness lies in the specifics of the nutrition this yogurt provides.  Also, flavour and variations is not mentioned either.  Adding these elements to the description could strengthen the description.  I would want to know the nutritional goodness this yogurt provides. this description mentions goodness but lacks the definition of what “goodness” signifies.  Protein and  calcium, is not mentioned.  These factors should be highlighted as nutritional goodness. 
 2.  California is known for almonds, therefore keeping that in the description is important.  Taste, texture, non dairy, plant based almond milk is also essential in the description.  
 3.  The entire description is very intriguing but adding elements of flavour variations is important making this non-dairy yogurt more appealing.  
 4. I want to know how much protein and calcium is in this non dairy yogurt.  It should somehow be highlighted. 
 If including goodness benefits and nutritional information along with flavouring variations, this description certainly stands a chance i like this description, it actually makes my tastebuds salivate.  I am intrigued and would definitely try this luxuriously creamy non-dairy almondmilk yogurt.  However, mention of its natural goodness  ingredients are missing.  To me, thats a large selling feature. This description hits the mark on texture and creaminess and really intrigues me as a consumer to try this product. The lack of benefits of this nondairy almondmilk yogurt is missing.  Almonds are a great source of calcium and protein, therefore that should be highlighted to overcome this weakness in the description. I would love to know the flavours and variations of this enticing nondairy yogurt.   If flavour variations and nutritional goodness was added to this description.  It would be perfect in my opinion. I think that non dairy substitutes could still be called the product they are trying to emulate.  Yes they don’t contain the dairy but they are being substituted for that product.  The textures, taste and look of the product is similar to their dairy counterparts.  If this product was not known as Yogurt than Dairy Free Cultured AlmondMilk could be acceptable.  This can be acceptable if the ingredients are pure and not heavily processed.   The Alternatives to Dairy Free Cultured AlmondMilk are Dairy Free Cultured Coconut.  I would improve it by using a variety of natural flavourings I believe that more and more people are turning to non dairy substitutes for either choice or intolerance.  Whatever the reason I feel that there is more awareness and interest in these products.  In my opinion I would place Blue Diamond in between Contemporary and traditional quadrant.  I would use impactful images of the amonds and creamy thick consistency of the yogurt.  Highlighting and the  use of Blue colour should be used in the packaging  The label is extremely important and should be emphasized on the packaging.  I also feel that regardless of what description is used this label would work well on them all rd",Smoothie,
225811,Renee,Townsend,rtown50@sbcglobal.net,"1.  When I think about yogurt I think of how this product has developed and how it has expanded.  There are so many more brands, types, and flavors.  There are so many brands but the ones that mainly come to mind are Dannon, Yoplait, Chobani, Oikos, Fage, and Activia.  I know some have a lot of added sugar but I feel most brands represent a healthy product. 2.  I love the taste and the healthy aspect.  Too much added sugar is not so great. 3.  I don't think there is a big difference between and non-dairy except possible intolerance to dairy.   4.  I consider all of these attributes - taste, flavor, texture and brand.  I like to know something about the brand such as if it is a well-known, trusted brand.  The taste and flavor are more important than texture.   5.  I would pay more for a yogurt that is more healthy.  If the ingredients are all natural without added sugar and still tastes good, I would pay a premium.  If it had added vitamins or health benefits, I would also pay more. 2.  I really like the Dannon Greek yogurt fit and light because it is low in calories but still has the health benefits.  It's smooth and tasty.   I like Oikos triple zero because it has 0 added sugar, 0 artificial sweeteners and 0 % fat and it doesn't sacrifice flavor.  I like Chobani  blended yogurt because it has no artificial flavors or sweeteners and again tastes good.  I really don't like Activia because it usually makes me feel bloated and uncomfortable. I don't really like the taste of Fage but it's been a while since I last tried it.  I didn't find that it had much flavor. 3.  I purchased Dannon fit and light because I want the health benefits without a lot of extra calories.  I also purchased  Oikos triple zero because I like the fact that it has 0 added sugar, 0 artificial flavors and 0% fat.   These are usually my go to brands.    4.  I believe Dannon brand is trying to say ""trust me"", I've been around for a while but that doesn't mean that my brand does not keep evolving and improving.  Messages I associate with Dannon are loyalty, health and environment conscious and variety. 5.  I think Blue Diamond should emulate what a quality product it is and its longevity.  It wouldn't be around for so long if it wasn't a good product.  I think they should avoid anything showing it's limitations.   6.  I like the way the design pops.  The color contrast looks good with the ""Blue Diamond"" in blue and the ""almonds"" in a tan color similar to almonds themselves.  There really is not much that I don't like about it. 1.  I would have to say that Blue Diamond will have to stand out because there are so many brands, types and flavors on the market today that it is hard to choose or even recognize them all.  I would say that first it has to be natural - no artificial sweeteners, added sugar or fat.  I think Blue Diamond is a well-known, trusted brand and that should be emphasized.  The health benefits of the almonds themselves also needs recognition. 2.  I think all the benefits that almond milk have over cow's milk need to stand out.  How those with lactose intolerance or vegans can enjoy a great tasting yogurt.  Blue Diamond starts out SMART - by using almonds rich in  fiber, protein, magnesium and vitamin E. 3.  The personality should be friendly and non-judgmental.  It should show no preferences as to gender, race, or religion.  The tone of voice would be calm and inviting.  An example would be the old Coca-Cola commercial where the song ""I'd like to teach the world to sing"" is sung by a diverse group of people who  are hand in hand. 4.  Blue Diamond - the SMART Choice.  Blue Diamond  - back to nature.  Blue Diamond - Tried and true.  Blue Diamond - a great beginning.  Blue Diamond - Almond Indulgence 5.  The well-known Blue Diamond symbol with the blue and tan coloring would be visible.  Then I would showcase a scene of nature. Possibly a bright, sunny scene with pink and white almond trees along with a few almonds and the fruit that represents the flavor of that particular yogurt. Uncompromised Goodness 1.  It will provide me with calcium that I need in my daily diet and it will give me energy.  It doesn't say if it is natural just plant based. 2.  I think the strength is the idea of providing energy, feeling great and ready to go. 3.  A weakness may be the phrase ""gives you all you need"" which is misleading.  It is not all that you need.  Maybe if it said gives you what you need to feel great.  ""All"" should be omitted. 4.  How is it non-dairy?  It's plant based almond yogurt but what kind of milk is used?  soy, almond, coconut?  Does it satisfy any other vitamin or mineral needs? 5.  I would like it to say plant based yogurt made with almond milk.  I like that it mentions it contains calcium and adding other nutritional benefits would make it more appealing. 1.  The mention of Blue Diamond almonds mean quality almonds are used.   California growers gives me a natural feel and tells me they are locally grown.  The healthy factor is missing. 2.  Strength is the quality of the brand and locally grown. 3.  Weakness is that other benefits are not clear.  Needs to mention healthy factors. 4.  Is it natural?  Are there vitamins?  Is it healthy? 5.  I would add more of the health benefits because it already comes across as a quality product. 1.  It mentions healthy twice which definitely makes a point.  It does not say what makes it healthy. 2.  Healthy and delicious are attractive selling points.  We want to be healthy but we want it to taste good. 3.  Weakness would be that it is too vague.  Nothing concrete but nice adjectives like luxuriously creamy and delicious. 4.  I still want to know what makes it healthy.  Does it contain any vitamins? 5.  Adding the calcium benefit would help along with benefits of being non-dairy. 1.  I believe calling it a non-dairy yogurt is fine.  It is wasn't known as a yogurt, it could be called almondmilk snack, or almondmilk parfait but parfait sounds less healthy and more like a dessert. 2.  Dairy-Free culltured almondmilk would not get my attention or entice me to try it.   3.  Dairy-free Probiotic Almondmilk snack. 1.  I would like to see it represented as contemporary.  I think it should be current.  I would want to try something that is new and up-to-date. 2.  They should position their product like no other product on the market using modern, fresh ideas or descriptions. 3.  Colour should be bright with a modern font and maybe the Blue Diamond symbol or at least a picture of almonds. 4.  I think they would work with all descriptions.  Watch out for anything that appears to be copying or too similar to what is already on the market.",Smoothie,
234995,Emily,Bache,emily@thewanderlustgirls.com,"1. I think of Yoplait, Activia and Chobani instantly when someone brings up yogurt. Yoplait to me is the classic go to yogurt, Activia I think of the actress lady from the commercials (haha to be honest) and Chobani I think of as the top Greek yogurt brand. Dannon is another prominent player, but it is more childish and geared towards children. When I think of yogurt I think probiotics. I think yogurt is a good go to snack. It's good for you, so you don't feel guilty for snacking on it. 
 2. I love that it is delicious and that it is a good quick snack. However, you can't really eat it on the go, unless it comes with a disposable spoon. (Although if it's not biodegradable it's such a waste for such a small snack.) I think drinkable yogurt is gross. 
 
 3. I love that they offer dairy free. I think they need more dairy free options. 
 4. I usually first think of flavor (I usually go for strawberry, blueberry or vanilla.) I don't like when they get too crazy. Next I go for brand and then texture. I like the ones that have granola on top as well. 
 5. If I was paying for a premium brand of yogurt it better offer some extra nutritional value than all the other yogurts. I love the taste. Yoplait is the go to for yogurt. That is the brand that always comes to mind and is super reliable. I know a lot of stores will carry it. I do not love the packaging it is a little too simple. When I would eat yogurt before I became lactose intolorent there would always be yoplait in the fridge. Simple is what it says to me. It's nothing fancy. Blue Diamond should emulate the taste. I would try and make it a bit more chic if yogurt could be chic. I really dislike the flower in the logo. It looks like a REALLY old computer designed this label. It needs to be updated.  
 I am not too familiar with the brand, but my roommate loves it. She has it everyday. They have memorable commercials. I always remember the girl from Freaky Friday in the commercials. It is clear that it is healthy ""probiotic yogurt."" However, it is a bit too healthy especially when they talk about it on the commercials. Blue Diamond should emulate the fact that it is healthy, but don't make it the main focus. I would not do an all over green color for packaging. I actually prefer the yogurts that are not all attached. 
 
 
 
 I think Go Gurt is disgusting. I know it is technically apart of Yoplait, but it feels like it's own category. The fact that you squeeze yogurt out of a tube just feels weird. They do a good job at gearing it towards their audience (young children on the go snacks or lunches.) I would not buy Go Gurt and it has not be in my fridge. Their message is that it is a better snack alternative for kids than a bag of chips. Blue Diamond could have an adult style yogurt and a kids yogurt one that is a bit more playful. Thaws by lunch... ew. I hate the design. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I love the packaging for this brand. It looks like an adult chic yogurt that you would find in Italy or Iceland haha. I've never had it in my fridge, but I've seen it in quite a few friends fridges. This is a nicer yogurt not just something you eat as you're running around, but as you're curled up watching tv. Blue Diamond should emulate the packaging. It is a simple container, but up to date.  
 Chobani is the more well known Greek yogurt on the market. I see a lot of people eating this especially business men/women during lunch hours. It's adult. I have never had it, but a lot of my friends have. They have great packaging simple and up to date. This seems nicer than regular yogurt because it's Greek yogurt and it's a little more expensive than the others. Blue Diamond should emulate having a Greek yogurt option as well. That seems to be trendier. I like that you can see what fruit is in it without the image looking too fake or computerized. 
 I I have never had this Silk yogurt. I love the fact that it's dairy free. I usually have So Delicious dairy free yogurt, but the grocery store I go to does not sell them. It does have terrible packaging and I have never had it in my fridge. I would like Blue Diamond to offer a dairy free option. The packaging is awful. It looks like you would get it at a hospital. It needs more life to it and to be up to date.  
 I do not like this brand. I have never tasted the yogurt, but the packaging is awful. I hate that you can see inside of the package and it's all separated. I think the brand is trying to show you that they're products are fresh and you can see it. However, it just looks like it should be mixed and it isn't mixing. I have never had this in my fridge and I've never seen anyone else have it either. It is a good idea for the packaging, but executed poorly. It also does not really look like yogurt. Maybe it's just me. 1. Based on all you know and have shared about existing yogurt brands, what advice do you have for how Blue Diamond might develop a brand that you’d love to try? Blue Diamond needs to think about being chic and up to date. I feel like a lot of these brands that were not so good or the things about the decent brands that were not good was the fact that they cheaped out on the packaging and just did super simple and colorful. If I were Blue Diamond I would use muted tones. They should also think about offering not just other flavor options, greek yogurt etc. as well as their dairy free. 2. How might Blue Diamond ensure their  non-dairy  brand stands out (in a good way!)? Make it simple and stated on the packaging. Non-dairy should be in bigger letters, so it's noticeable when you are walking by the yogurt aisle. I don't even go down there anymore because I know I can't have it, but if I noticed it as I walked by I would more likely buy it. Keep it adult as well. 
 3. What personality or tone of voice should it have? Do you have any examples? I can't really think a tone of voice or any examples. Just make it adult centric. A lot of adults offer their yogurt to their children, but an adult rarely eats a childrens yogurt. 
 4. What types of name would you like Blue Diamond to consider? I can't think of something specific it really depends on what type of yogurt they are going for, but a word in another language is always best. I suggest one of the romance languages. Like liscio, which means smooth in Italian. 

 
 5. What packaging design ideas do you think could really elevate this brand? Keep it muted tones. Emulate Siggi's or other European brands. I love the packages they use as well. Sell it in individual packages and not in a tear away pack. Uncompromised Goodness I like that it tells you that it gives you calcium and that it is plant based almond yogurt. Again this has a ton of fluff. ""gives you all you need to feel great and ready to go throughout the day."" Not necessary. The strength is the same as the last one that it is non-dairy and plant based. However, that is overlooked by the length of this description. I'd like to know a short list of ingredients and the information about the almonds. Shorten and be more factual. I like this one the best as I said before it is simple and to the point. You get what you need out of it. I think it's powerful to know where the almonds come from. It doesn't have much of a weakness. I think it sounds great. I know everything I want to know when purchasing. I do not like that healthy has been mentioned twice. Tell us what is healthy about it don't just say it. The most important part is the non-dairy aspect that it is made with almond milk. Not that fact that it could be eaten at any time of the day. Just give facts rather than telling us fluff and letting people guess. It's like those granola bars that just say 2 eggs, 1 date, etc. You know exactly what you are eating no fluff that's what people want these days. I would like to know simple ingredient list and the fact that there are actual almonds from California to sprinkle in. 1. I honestly don't think I would eat it if it wasn't called some version of non-dairy yogurt. I know you are asking for alternative names and my opinion as someone who cannot eat dairy that it is a bad idea to change it all together. I want to know what I'm eating and what it will taste like and the vibe of it and just calling yogurt I already know what it is. If you called it like smooth creamy fruit and almond milk I'd think it was gross.  2. I hate this. The word cultured is such a turn off, especially from food.  3. Take out cultured for sure. But then it is just almond milk. I honestly think it's a terrible idea. This just makes me think of bad bacteria not good bacteria. 1. I would love to see it in contemporary and serious top right quadrant. Those are the best trendiest yogurt brands and they have the best more up to date containers. The more colorful ones are too cheesy.  2. Keep the packaging muted colors and simple fonts. Not a ton going on and nothing too childish.  3.  I think if you use one of these tones the package will look better and Ailerons font. Here is a link to a lot of modern fonts that I like. Almost of all of them would work for this. https://www.canva.com/learn/mo... 4. I think this would work for all the positionings.",Smoothie,
225809,Pavithra,Sivamani,psivamani@gmail.com,"1) Yogurt category associations: White, creamy, cows, yummy, yogurt rice 
 Players I am aware of: 
 Home made yogurt - Best of the lot, wholesome, nutritive, preservative free, sugar free 
 Chobani: Employee oriented. Products stretch across the category ranging from plain yogurt to flavored and drinkable 
 Stonyfield: Huge association of organic maybe because the brand reads as Stonyfield organic 
 Noosa: Never tried this brand but heard a lot of good things - creamy yet light and fresh. Would like to try this brand. 
 Yoplait: Not vegetarian. Ever since I found that some of its products contain gelatin, I don't go anywhere near it 
 2) There has never been a time where I have been without yogurt. It is very difficult to express your love for something that you have grown up with - like family. Right from my younger days till today, at least one half of our refrigerator shelf stocks yogurt. One of those things you never want to run out of. Taken after a meal, or as a snack, in a cup or in a glass (as lassi), it is great for digestion. In India, yogurt rice is considered the most harmless meal if you are ill. Yogurt is comfort food, satisfying and filling. Yogurt is that friend who is always around to take care of me.  While I am inclined to say that I dislike nothing about yogurt, of late, I have been worried about the fat and cholesterol in it. Some may argue that these are healthy fats but it is fat and I am looking to eat more healthy. 
 
 3) Yogurt for me has always been a dairy staple. I learnt about non dairy products, veganism and lactose intolerance only when I moved to the US a few years ago. Initially, I experimented with non dairy yogurt just to explore the taste but I was so used to dairy yogurt that the taste didn't find favor with me. I am thinking of shifting more towards it purely for health reasons. However, I still have my doubts for two reasons (i) As vegetarians, dairy is a major source of protein for us. 1/3 cup of greek yogurt gives around 8gm of protein. Now this is completely missing in non dairy yogurt. (ii) There is a lot of good, probiotic bacteria in dairy yogurt that aids digestive health and metabolism - which is missing in non dairy yogurt. Specific to almond yogurt, I tend to doubt the extent to which the nutrition of raw almonds passes down to milk and therefore to yogurt. 
 4) Choosing yogurt boils down to these factors in order of importance: (a) Ingredients - Kind of milk used/vegetarian (b) Nutritive values - proteins/fats/sugars, etc (c) Price - We use a lot if it so the small cups never suffice (d) Texture - Thick/Creamy and lastly (e) Taste - Slightly sour/tart. If I was to choose a non dairy yogurt, I would look for the source. For example, I would be more inclined to choose an almond yogurt over a coconut milk yogurt. 
 5) I would be willing to pay a premium for organic yogurt and even for yogurt made from A2 milk. Also, knowing that the yogurt is a niche batch product and is made with an exclusive process that uses superior ingredients and technology. Most of these pictures have been taken at Costco where we buy most of our stuff. Like I mentioned earlier, yogurt is needed in large quantities at home and for this reason, Costco prices are better. 
 
 
 (1) This is Indian style yogurt that we buy most (2) We like this brand because this works best for Indian cooking. (3) This is a staple in our refrigerator. We buy this because the taste is very close to home style yogurt and because of the Indian connection (4) The key messages that come out are natural and dairy yogurt. The cows indicate grass fed. The colour scheme - green, white and orange - connote the colors of the Indian flag (5) Blue Diamond should not take anything from this as they need a more evocative design (6) I don't like the design - it is too patchy, the image is not sharp and there is a sense of imbalance. 
 
 (1) This is Costco's own brand of Greek Yogurt (2) We like that it is loaded with protein and the price is also good - $5.89 for 2*32 oz (3) We buy this brand often because it is filling and wholesome and it lends itself to baking, making salad dressing, white sauce, etc (4) There is not much that the brand is saying - it is pretty functional packaging, does the job. It is plain yogurt so I guess that is okay (5) Again, Blue Diamond should avoid taking anything from here and go for more attractive packaging (6) The only thing that comes across is the Greek style columns. Otherwise, the choice of colors and fonts seem to be on a whim with no reasoning. 
 
 
 
 (1) This is not technically yogurt but I am considering it so because of the live cultures added to the milk (2) I liked the fact that there were not too many ingredients and the strawberry taste. On the flip side, it is way too sugary (3) I had a load of this when I was pregnant. The serving size was perfect and the bottles fit well in the fridge and my bag (4) The brand is riding big on organic. Pictorially depicts flavor. Since this is a closed carton, they also show how the bottle looks. Indicating grass fed seems to be common (5)  Blue Diamond can think about depicting its key ingredient in an artistic fashion (6) Nothing to really like about the design. Strawberries making a splash in yogurt or the pink color of the smoothie would have been a good visual cue 
 
 
 
 (1) This is something that I have not tried but would like to (2) I like the fact that it comes with toppings - I always like toppings on all my desserts. However, this can only be an occasional snack due to its high sugar content (3) I have not yet purchased this brand. I am waiting for some space in my refrigerator to get cleared our before I can buy and stock this (4) The branding of Chobani flip along with the pictorial representation point to how you can sprinkle the toppings on the yogurt (5) Blue Diamond can include some toppings or fudge or sauce (chocolate/hazelnut/peanut butter, etc) that can complement the yogurt (6) This packaging is better than the earlier ones that I had discussed. The dolor schemes are ingredient based and the visuals support the flip branding. Instead of using just a label, Chobani could have used all the extra space to create more powerful imagery 
 (1) This is a brand that I was very excited to try initially but skipped (2) I do not like that it has gelatin (3) I have not and will not purchase this brand because it is not vegetarian (4) I am not quite sure what this brand is trying to say - unclear on what the brand symbol stands for (5) If anything at all, Blue Diamond should avoid being ambiguous like Yoplait (6) I like that there is no green in the packaging for a change. 1) The dairy yogurt category is a crowded one with well established brands. Talking about Non-GMO and grass fed cows is the norm. The packaging theme is largely dominated by white and green and colors of the flavors. The non dairy yogurt category, on the other hand, is just beginning to unfold. The brands are relatively unknown and very niche. There is also relatively low information on this category. 
 Being a reputed brand, Blue Diamond should establish itself as the pioneer in a fledgling category. It should build the non dairy category and position itself as the forerunner in its category. 
 In India, Amul - a milk co-operative union - used the same strategy successfully. It built the milk category by talking about the benefits of drinking milk and in the process, built its own brand. Here is a link to the commercial: 
 
 2) Product wise, Blue Diamond can consider adding protein to the yogurt to make it more equatable to dairy yogurt (health wise). Brand wise, Blue Diamond should act as the forerunner of veganism and center its activities around it. For example, have a separate vegan shelf in leading supermarkets, maybe promoting a vegan episode of Master Chef and running a non dairy yogurt channel on social media. 
 3) Today's busy generation wants to take care of their health but do not have the time to do so. Blue Diamond Almond Yogurt is the ideal snack for these people. The tone of communication should be young and zesty and bursting with health. 
 4) Blue Diamond should consider names that cue almonds. It should also not tie it down to yogurt so the same name can be used when expanding to other categories such as smoothies, frozen yogurt, etc. 
 5) Here is a brand of almond yogurt that can be a reference for packaging: 
 
 
 
 I found the design to be very appealing and elegant. I liked the idea of depicting the flavor within the almond. Our design should also be heavy on non dairy and almonds. The design should also have a lot of energy in it. Packaging wise, we can look at a different shape, maybe even in the shape of an almond. Also, when you buy yogurt as a snack when you are out, you end up hunting for a spoon. Our package can also include a small spoon. Also, none of the brands uses its tag line on the pack. We should use our tag line of 'From our hearts to your hands' on the pack. Healthy Vitality 1) This does not mentioned that the yogurt is made with cultured almond milk (because non dairy yogurt can also be made from starch). There is a chance that almond yogurt might be interpreted as almond flavored yogurt rather than being made from almond milk. It also makes me wonder what flavors will be available and how the taste will be different from dairy yogurt 
 2) I think the calcium has a potential to be a strong point of this description.  Most dairy yogurts, especially the greek ones are loaded with protein unlike its non dairy counterparts. Calcium is so essential for bone health, skin , nails, etc - all of which contribute to vitality. Most good sources of calcium today are dairy based like milk and cheese that also come with a large percentage of calories and fats. Almond Yogurt provides the right amounts of calcium without all of that - healthy calcium. 
 3) Well this is not a weakness per se, but descriptors such as best tasting (delicious), smooth, light, etc are just so overdone. Almost every brand talks about these. However, I wonder if it even needs to be overcome because it is par for the course. Maybe we can play that down a bit and up the vitality and calcium bits. 
 4) Maybe the price. Because good quality almonds are expensive, I will wonder of almond yogurt is expensive too. And the points mentioned in Question 1. 
 5) Maybe starting the description with a problem statement that the target consumer faces today and positioning almond yogurt as the solution will make it more relatable and personable. I would also call it almond milk yogurt rather than almond yogurt to avoid any confusions. This is also the first vegan yogurt from a major player - that could be played to our advantage. 1) I would want to know more about how Blue Diamond packs the yogurt with 'goodness'. This includes stuff such as source of the almonds, cultures used in making the yogurt (vegan vs vegetarian cultures), how much of almonds in one pack of yogurt. 2) The strength here is the source of almonds, especially the name Blue Diamond which is very well known. 3) Uncompromised goodness is a bit vague. This can be overcome by describing this better - for example, one cup of yogurt packs X gms of almonds.  4) Since we are talking about the growers here, I would want to know more about the process of making the almond yogurt.  5) Maybe we can talk about how Blue Diamond is a co-operative and how they grow the best almonds. We can also get the positioning to reflect how the goodness of almonds will not get lost while making it into almond milk and then yogurt. 1) Apart from the flavors available, I will wonder where the taste and health come from. In the earlier description, calcium was clearly a support for health but there is none here. 
 2) I am sorry - I do not see any strength in this statement 
 3) This statement rides too much on the taste and health platform and that is too vague. So much that delicious and healthy are repeated twice in two sentences. 
 4) Why is this yogurt healthy? And how is this more delicious than other yogurts in the market, dairy or non dairy? 
 5) Maybe if we take the health angle a bit ahead and make it specific - like heart health, fitness, diabetic health, etc, it may work. Or develop the taste angle better - make it a creamy, indulgent yogurt that's a great pick me up any time of the day 1) I think it is fine to call this yogurt. It would not work if it was being made from some sort of starch but since we are using cultures, yogurt works. Also by that logic, almond milk is more of pressed almonds than milk. If on-dairy milk from almonds is acceptable, so is almond milk yogurt. 
 2) Cultured almond milk makes this sound more of a smoothie and drinkable in consistency while our yogurt is spoonable. I think this may cause some confusion in imagery and perception. 
 3) How about calling it Almond Curd. Or Dairy-Free Cultured, Thick Almondmilk. Dairy-Free cultured, creamy almondmilk. 1) The new yogurt should be in the top left quadrant (Playful, Contemporary). Since the positioning that I liked was the vitality one, that has a certain energy and bounce to it that can be depicted in the playful quadrant. Also, the yogurt market today is crowded with white and green tubs and pictures of zoomed in fruits. Staying in the contemporary quadrant will help set us apart. 
 2) Veganism is a growing trend today. Since 2014 to now, Veganism in the US has grown by 600%. Over 1 million people in the US are vegans. Vegans believe that their choice has made them healthy and energetic. Luckily for us, while there are many vegan milk and yogurt brands, they are all niche and / or artisan. Blue Diamond should take up the cause of veganism and use that to launch yogurt and other related products on the vitality platform. 
 3) Blue Diamond should steer clear of the current white/green predominant color scheme and go for bright colors and bold typefaces that will immediately set it apart from the clutter in the yogurt section. Also, the words 'Dairy-Free' or 'Vegan' should be highlighted well. Currently, there is no demarcation when it coems to placement of dairy and non-dairy yogurt. Using these terms will carve out a place for our yogurt. 
 
 4) This direction will work for the vitality and goodness positioning but not for the indulgent, creamy, tasty one. For the latter, a more elegant, serious approach is needed.",Smoothie,
225815,Shirley,Zhu,shirley.jpg@gmail.com,"1. I think of yogurt as an overall means of nutrition -- it is marketed toward children as something nutritious that they can eat in the morning or as a snack (e.g. Dannon's kids yogurts, Yoplait's Go-Gurt product), and marketed toward adults as something light and healthy that they can eat in the morning. Depending on the target audience, there are certain positions that yogurt takes -- for kids, it can be convenience (e.g. Go-Gurt coming in an on-the-go squeeze tube), and for adults, it can be an alternate breakfast or a dieter's friend, a way to get calcium, protein and other nutrients without consuming milk/other dairy products, etc. For adults, I'd consider Fage, Chobani, and Dannon to be major players. As far as perceptions go, the protein-heavy brands (Fage, Chobani) represent healthy choices marketed to the very health-conscious and likely physically active adults, while Dannon represents an option that adults who might want to try being healthier can try to get started (I mostly say this because I think of the sugar content in most flavored yogurts). 
 2. I love the fact that yogurt can either be eaten plain or as dressed up as I'd like it to be. I also love using it in baking and incorporating vegetables or savory elements into it -- it's very versatile. What I don't like about yogurt has more to do with brand offerings -- I like certain brands more than others, and I think the general consumer that many yogurt brands are marketing toward may tend toward sweeter yogurts. I prefer plain yogurts that I can dress up on my own, and I think this type of offering is generally more limited in the average grocery store. 
 
 3. I don't mind either one. I have eaten coconut yogurt (from So Delicious) a handful of times, and I have found that the only real superficial differentiating factor is in the taste, and it tends to lack a certain amount of tang that I'm used to. Otherwise, the coconut yogurt has been fine and serves its purpose. 
 
 4. I almost always eat my yogurt plain and non-fat, so I am picky, and I prioritize protein content (the higher the better) and taste (not too tangy). Texturewise, I prefer something like a thick Greek yogurt because it feels more filling afterward. A thicker yogurt feels like it has substance to it, where a thin yogurt feels better from a bottle than a cup. I don't care very much about brand, but I have tried many different kinds of yogurt, and I have found that Fage's 0% plain is my favorite -- it strikes the balance between tangy and sweet, and it's thick without the tendency to gather water. 
 
 5. I would pay a premium for yogurt if the nutrients were in the right balance (i.e. protein content is high and the caloric value is low) and the taste was in the right place. If there are two yogurts with similar nutritional offering, and one tasted more tangy and were cheaper, I would opt for the more expensive yogurt that tasted better 9/10 times. z      
 2. I'm putting Fage and Chobani in the same category, but Fage 0% is my tried-and-true favorite of all time. I love that Fage's quality is high and consistent. I buy Chobani as its lesser but closest equivalent when I want to save a little money, but the taste and texture is definitely not the same. Outside of the 0% plain variety that I usually buy, I appreciate that both Fage and Chobani offer a ""flip cup"" version where consumers can add as little or much of the ""fruit""/sugar that they want. The cup is good for the texture and I feel that the serving amount is just right.  
 3. Yes, I buy both Fage and Chobani regularly. I usually buy whichever brand happens to be on sale for the week. I like these two brands as my regular brands because they offer high protein value and are better tasting than most other plain yogurts. 
 4. I associate these two brands with health and fitness. When I see the clean designs, I think of the quality and reliability from having known it for years. 
 5/6. Blue Diamond should avoid making the package too ""cute,"" like the Oui yogurt from Yoplait (picture A below). I think the appeal of Fage and Chobani is in its design, both product and packaging. The packaging is similar in shape, and easy to throw a spoon into. It's practical by design and easy on the eyes. Product-wise, I think Blue Diamond should think about making yogurts with the flavoring already mixed in. The beauty of plain yogurt is in its customization potential.  
 
 
 
 2. Siggi's does a great job of introducing skyr to the market, and it's approachable. I like that the design is friendly, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. The price is also decent, as it goes on sale occasionally. 
 3. Yes, I buy Siggi's yogurt when I want a break from Greek yogurt. I would buy it more often if I liked the taste and consistency of the actual yogurt itself more, but it is a fine alternative to me. 
 4. I associate Siggi's with health, and with a bit of an alternative edge. It has a very natural (that is, no bad additives) feel to it, and the illustrations on their labels give the impression of something organic, home-made, and artificial ingredient-free. 
 5/6. I don't think there's anything about this that Blue Diamond should not adopt. I would say that the appeal of Siggi's is in its actual product offering. I think it's at the forefront of introducing a new yogurt product (Icelandic yogurt) to the market, and they're doing a great job of making it look approachable, relatable, and familiar all at once.    
 
 
       
 2. I have tried Yoplait Light and Noosa on difference occasions, and while they were fine in taste, I felt that they were too sweet, and therefore not a yogurt I would want to consume regularly. These felt more like a treat than what I typically associate with health/nutrients. 
 3. Yes, I grew up eating Yoplait yogurts and I have purchased Noosa from time to time. I had heard good things about Noosa from friends, and it was something I was willing to try, given its premium price and the rave reviews from friends. 
 4. I associate Yoplait with the accessibility of the everyday supermarket, something that I can get at every store. I think of Yoplait Light as the gateway health yogurt that is designed to reach people who want to try something different from the average fruit-mixed yogurt for the first time. It is a familiar family brand so it is approachable. With Noosa, I know that their marketing is around ""something different,"" and that is evident in their package design as well. 
 5/6. I think the takeaway here for Blue Diamond is in package design. I don't like the package design for Noosa, as it seems confusing -- am I supposed to eat the whole tub of yogurt in one sitting? Why is the tub so low? 
 Appendix: 
 A. 1. I think Blue Diamond should make the yogurt look familiar, and the packaging should be thoughtful (deep tubs for spoons for thick yogurt or bottles for thin yogurt, whichever direction they choose to go). The design should be clean and approachable. Blue Diamond should also choose whether or not they want to highlight the health benefits on the cup -- non-fat, sugar-free, organic, etc. 
 2. Blue Diamond should consider the natural/small-batch marketing route by pointing out that their yogurt is made from 100% natural ingredients, hormone-free, made in small batches, etc. While this is something that other brands have done before, I think this type of positioning is attractive, and especially for a product that is a little different from ordinary (like what Siggi's does for skyr). 
 3. The personality should be something that connotes lightness or purity (no additives). I like the clean positioning because when I think of dairy-free, I am conversely thinking about the burden of dairy, or the troubles that dairy products might impose on someone who would consider the dairy-free route.    
 4. I would use words that connote lightness, delicate flavors, airiness, gentleness. I think words and designs that would sell on texture and mouthfeel would work well with a non-dairy product. 
 5. I think light colors (think pastels) and a lot of white space would work well, since the yogurt is likely white in color itself. I personally prefer cups over bottles (bottles seem more wasteful somehow, even though cups and bottles are the same in essence), but perhaps because consuming a yogurt with a spoon seems more like a relaxing ""me time"" food as opposed to an on-the-go food that one rushes through with a bottle. I think clean lines (like the Siggi's cup) are easy on the eyes, and matte textures look more premium than the glossy ones. I know that it is a popular trend, but I am not very fond of glass containers simply for the fact that they look too precious and take up space after a while. Uncompromised Goodness 1. I don't think there is much left unsaid. I think plant-based can sub in for ""natural,"" but I wonder if ""all natural"" carries more weight than ""plant-based."" If the product is in fact nutritious, I would mention that more than just 'calcium.' 2. I think the strength of this positioning lies in the fact that it hits several notes, including health and texture. I think that consumers are looking to yogurt as a healthy and light alternative to a meal, so this description works toward conveying this message. 3. I think the weakness is in some of the word choice. I don't like the mention of ""vitality"" because it seems a bit lofty. It may be fixed by simply adjusting the word choice - perhaps pivoting to satisfaction (e.g. ""feeling satisfied"") would be good. ""Best tasting"" can be changed to one word like ""tastiest"" or simply ""delicious"" (e.g. ""A delicious non-dairy..""). I had mentioned this earlier, but ""dairy-free"" resonates with me over ""non-dairy"".
 4. My first (and perhaps only) question would be around the vitality claim, as it seems a bit strong.  5. I think cutting down on the two-word adjectives would help tighten up the message -- I think it is pretty strong in its purpose as is. 1. The talk of quality and sourcing leads me to think of whether or not this is an organic product, or how natural this product is.  2. The strength of this message is the way it's written -- it is succinct and written with purpose. It isn't drowning in descriptors and can convey the message that the product is from California, natural, and special.  3. No real weaknesses in this one. I think it could certainly be cut down so that one doesn't repeat ""non-dairy"" twice, that it doesn't use long descriptors where it can use shorter ones. 4. I would like to know if this is a vegan product, because if it were, I would use that word instead of ""non-dairy, plant-based."" 5. I would include more details around how natural the product is, but I would also likely combine this write-up with the previous one. 1. It seems to be missing the Blue Diamond branding, or what makes BD special. I would mention something about its ""California-grown"" or ""natural"" properties. It's not 100% necessary, but it certainly would help this description along. 
 2. The strength of this description lies in the fact that you have a lot of good adjectives that are enticing to the average consumer. 
 3. The weakness is in the bulkiness of the text, I think. Rather than stacking all of the adjectives together, it might be good to move it around (e.g. ""Our smooth and luxuriously creamy almondmilk yogurt is a delicious dairy-free choice for any time of day.""). Is there any objection to using ""non-dairy"" instead of ""dairy-free""? I feel as though ""dairy-free"" would resonate more with the audience. 
 4. My question that would follow would be around the ""healthy"" claim -- is this product low-calorie? What kinds of nutrients are present? 
 5. I would cut down on the repetition between the two sentences - I think that the second sentence would be able to stand on its own with some rearranging of words. I would also try to put in something about natural ingredients or something tying in California almonds. Also, it should be ""any time"" of day. 1. I think you can market it as a yogurt alternative, cream of coconut, coconut creme, coconut essence. 2. Too bulky of a name. Is ""almondmilk"" one word?  3. I would call it ""vegan"" if it were, but if we had to use ""dairy-free,"" I would call it dairy-free coconut cream, as ""culture"" would likely complicate the picture to the average consumer. 1. I see BD's new product in the contemporary-serious quadrant -- I'm assuming that this is referring to packaging. I think this quadrant looks the most expensive/high-quality. 2. I think positioning the farm-to-table, natural qualities would elevate the brand's product. A minimal and natural message would likely boost the reputation from everyday grocery to everyday luxury.  3. Serif fonts look better against white backdrops (e.g. Siggi's vs. Activia). I think good use of whitespace would add a design-driven edge to compete with other yogurt products. The below image of a kefir bottle design illustrates this -- the average kefir bottle looks crowded and clinical, where as the below is minimal and expensive-looking.  4. I think the positioning statements would work with a design-y and minimal packaging if colors/symbols can be used to convey ideas around natural ingredients as well. I think that complex symbols might confuse the consumer, so over-designing might not be the best idea. I had mentioned in Part 1 that pictures that convey a sense of almond-farm-to-grocery would work as well.",Smoothie,INFJ
225813,Rene,Diaz,renesandy@gmail.com,"1. Right now the industry and consumers are big on greek yogurt, with Chobani and Danon coming to mind. Those are the two brands that I interact with the most, and both have expanded into drinkable greek yogurt smoothies. Further, Danon also has a range of products under its greek yogurt umbrella (Light and Fit, Oikos, etc.).

2. For me taste is number one. Unfortunately, big taste, to mask the greek yogurt, is coupled with high sugar content. 

3. I don't, I think one of a replacement for the other. 

4. Taste and brand are number one, which is why I seldom deviate from the two aforementioned because I know I can trust it. 

5. Certainly, but with all of them usually going for .99 cent it may be difficult at first to make the initial purchase. 1.  I didn't know the activity involved going to the store and its closing today, so I decided to just attach pics of the brands that I like/consume. I wouldn't say I dislike certain brands, per se, (other than the store brands), but it is imperative that my yogurt be greek/low on sugar/low on calories/high on protein.  

2. These brands all have tasty flavors and a good balance of protein/calories/sugars, etc. Also, they have a vast variation of flavors, and have expanded their lines into other products, such as the flip cups and the drinkable yogurts. Also they are usually 1.00 each.

3. Yes, I have purchased all of the above products. 

4.Flavor variations should be emulated, but high sugar content should be avoided. 

5. I love the design of the packaging, if that's what the question is referencing. They're convenient, portable, and make for great quick snacks. 1. Introductory prices, maybe $1.00 or some promotion with the purchase of other products to introduce to market, but above all its about the flavor and nutritional content/benefits. Maybe even digestive health benefits?

2. Almond yogurt should be an interesting concept, maybe with statements that compare the new product to existing greek yogurt competitors. 

3. Definitely a chobani and danon feel, where its straight to the point, but airy, light, and conscience (the messaging). 

4. This is always hard, but I think just being an almond product will help it stand out: ""NATURAL ALMOND YOGURT.""

5. The current trends would be fine, but if the intention is for the product to stand out on shelves then perhaps some tie-in to other blue almond products that direct the consumer to the yogurts would be beneficial (our almonds, great when paired with our yogurt). Uncompromised Goodness 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid?
 I just wonder how accurate the language is versus how much was coined by a marketing team, ie. ""full of vitality."" Also, is the yogurt ""plant-based"" because its uses almonds which come from plants? Why not almond-based? 

 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why.
 ""The best tasting non-dairy yogurt"" because its enticing and perhaps will lead me to try it, and ""a tasty source of calcium"" because I hadn't even thought about how almond-based versus dairy-based would affect calcium content .

 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome?
 ""Vitality"" is a a loaded word that feels like marketing shtick. Further, ""all you need to feel great and ready to go throughout the day"" feels too familiar and again, like a marketing shtick.  

 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know?
 I just want to taste to make my own judgement. 

 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help?
 Informational without necessarily being overly familiar. I think the focus should be on the almonds. 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid?
 This was my favorite, it enticed me and provided me with some brand information without sounding hyperbolic. No questions, just want to taste to see if expectations match claims. 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why.
 ""Best tasting non-dairy yogurt packed with uncompromised goodness."" Also, the blurb of Blue Diamond's ""almonds from our California growers"" gives more info on the brand, in line with other verbiage from BD. Last, ""smooth and deliciously creamy"" gives insight into the product, while satiating texture concerns. 
 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome?
 This was my favorite, so I see nothing wrong with it. I just wonder why, even though almonds come from plants, the term is ""plant-based"" versus ""almond-based"" 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know?
 This makes me want to taste product.  
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help?
 N/A 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid?
 Nothing was left unsaid, but there's no particular brand/product-specific verbiage.

 Product description.

 N/A 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help?
 More product or brand specific language. 1. ALMONDMILK, even before seeing the lower-half, it seems to be the common theme throughout this part. 

2. Unsure why ""cultured"" is used, but aside from that think its representative of the product. 

3. ALMONDMILK, AlmondMILK, ALMilk, etc. Something with almonds and milk! 1. Below is a visual representation of various yogurt brands that are currently available in stores. The axes range from playful to serious and from traditional to contemporary. Where would you most like to see Blue Diamond's new product positioned on this quadrant and why.
 I think the main product should  definitely be in contemporary and perhaps somewhat towards serious, but not entirely too serious. I would expect for the brand to launch several brands that cater to both serious and playful, such as Chobani and their regular yogurt and ""flip"" branded.   

 2. What advice do you have that could help Blue Diamond position their new brand where you would most like to see it? 
 I think that BD should not limit itself to one product, rather, a new brand of products with sub-variants that allows for it to offer ""serious"" and ""playful"" products. I also think that since BD also sells other products, perhaps special promotions ""buy milk get a free yogurt,"" etc. 
 
 3. How could they use colour, typeface, imagery and symbols to achieve this? Please upload images that would help us to understand the look and feel you’d like Blue Diamond to adopt.
 I'm unsure, but it does have to be in line with the BD brand.  
 4. Would these design ideas work equally well for each of the three positioning descriptions? Are there any watch-outs for Blue Diamond to keep in mind? Same all around.",Smoothie,
225787,Amanda,Johnston,johnston.amandalynn@gmail.com,"That’s quite the question. I have mixed feelings about yogurt because I’m lactose intolerant. I love the taste of fancy yogurts like noosa as well as the store brand plain yogurts that I can dress up with honey and granola. I’d say the best thing about yogurt for me is the possibilities. The worst thing is how easily it spoils (and the fact that I can have very little dairy before getting ill, but that’s not yogurt’s fault). 
  
 
  
 I’ve actually never had non-dairy yogurt. I love the prospect, especially since I like yogurt so much I’ve ignored the doctor’s instructions not to eat it. I guess Doc and I could come to an accord. My first question would be what’s in non-dairy yogurt? Frankly though I’m not sure I know what’s in dairy yogurt.
  
 
  
 When choosing yogurt I look at a few things, price and expiration being the first two. Once I find a brand I like that’s affordable and not expiring tomorrow (sometimes difficult where I live), I go based on flavor. Sometimes I’m in the mood for plain. Sometimes I want peach or strawberry rhubarb. 
  
 
  
 I’m a big fan of the Greek yogurts. As far as texture is concerned, I don’t like yogurt to be too smooth or too chunky. I’d say a smooth yogurt with chunks of fruit would be my first choice, or I’d buy a plain yogurt on the smoother side and add dressings.
  
 
  
 Usually price is a big part of my decision. However, sometimes I spend more to buy noosa. It’s really smooth and creamy. I pay extra for it because it’s different. It also has cool packaging. That sounds silly, but I like the little cow and bee drawings and the puns they have on the lids. Yoplait
  
 Like 
   I like the taste of original Yoplait because of the smooth texture and chunks of fruit. Some of their marketing in the past was good too. It always felt like a healthy snack to me, which I liked.
   I have bought it because of the flavor options. I like the taste of the original ones. They also had some good marketing campaigns in the past that encouraged me to buy it, for example saving lids for breast cancer research.
   I think it’s trying to say “healthy can taste good”
   I like having flavor options but Yoplait almost has too many combinations of flavors and types (whipped, original, custard, etc.).
   I like the logo. I hate the shape of the container. It’s difficult to eat out of and there is actually a huge problem with wildlife getting their faces caught in the empty containers. I stopped buying this product for that reason alone.
   
 
  
 
 Oikos
  
 Dislike
   It may be unfair to say I dislike this having had one bite ever. But I feel like it’s trying too hard. The product has so many nice things written all over it I almost think it’s lying to me. I can feel it trying to convince me to buy it but not in a good way; I feel like it’s pressuring me.
   No, I’ve never bought it.
   The brand tries to say everything at once. It’s Oikos, but it’s Dannon. It’s non-GMO, it’s all natural, it has vitamin D, it’s Greek yogurt. 
   I think the cup design is great. I’d try not to overwhelm the consumer with everything they want to hear all at once. 
   The simple design is lovely and helps you identify the flavor easily.  I just wish it wasn’t overpopulated with so much written information.
   
 
  
 
 Kroger Greek
  
 Like 
   It’s no-nonsense and it gets the job done.
   Yes, this is my go-to yogurt for mix-ins. 
   To me it says, “I’m the smart choice everyone overlooks.” 
   I think Blue Diamond should emulate how straightforward this brand is. It’s telling me the truth, including “with other natural flavors.” That’s why I trust them. They’re just telling it like it is.
   The design is simple. I like that, but it’s probably too simple. It’s the type of design that grabs no one’s eye unless you’re looking at prices first. 
   
 
  
 
 Chobani Flip
  
 Dislike
   The flavors got far too extravagant for me. I’m from the Midwest. We like bland food.
   I have bought it. It’s great if you don’t really like yogurt. It hardly tastes like yogurt at all. I like toppings on my yogurt, so that was the initial draw before the flavors got crazy.
   To me it says “I’m fun and trendy.”
   The option for mix-ins is great. Maybe just make sure there’s some yogurt left in the yogurt. 
   The design is convenient to an extent. The flip is not flawless, but for the most part the mix-ins end up in the yogurt. It’s easier than the original mix-in yogurts that put the extras on top of the lid. That was a mess.
   
 
  
 
 Noosa
  
 Like 
   Creamy and delicious
   Yes, but it’s generally expensive so I only buy it as a special treat.
   I associate it with Australia, which means nothing because I’ve never been to Australia. I also think of it as a kind of high-class, fancy yogurt (if that makes any sense). 
   I like the sophisticated yet playful design. It’s also nice to see the yogurt through the container. 
   The containers are huge! I was very happy when they came out with little ones so I can actually eat one in a sitting. The reusable lid is very convenient for the larger containers. And I love the designs and puns on the disposable cover. Always look forward to opening my yogurt.
   
 
  
 
 Activia
  
 Like
   It tastes fine and is supposed to be very good for your health.
   I’ve never bought it. I’ve only had it at work. I guess I thought it was for old people.
   To me it says, “Be healthy and take care of yourself.”
   Selling connected cups seems kind of outdated. I want to mix and match my flavors. Still, I like the smoothness of this yogurt.
   The design is unique because of the multi-cup packaging. It allows Dannon to incorporate more messaging without it being too overwhelming.
   

 
  
 Simple Truth Organic
  
 On the fence
   Just like Kroger, Simple Truth is a store brand, but it plays the healthy/trendy angle. Even though it’s exactly the same as the Kroger brand, they sell this in a container that says organic and double the price.
   I’ve bought it before, but don’t anymore. I prefer the smaller cups. 
   It says “Eat this healthy thing and save the planet,” and you’re saving money because it’s store brand.
   Like Oikos this goes over the top with the fads. Do I really need someone to tell me that yogurt is gluten free?
   The design looks too busy. Way too much information. It’s like a brochure wrapped around a plastic tub.
   
 
  
 
 Silk
  
 Dislike
   The words Yogurt Alternative freak me out. Too mysterious.
   Never bought it because I’ve never seen it before today.
   It says, “Dairy free, soy free. If you have allergies, pick me.”
   I would avoid the words Yogurt Alternative if at all possible. 
   The container almost looks like a disposable ice cream cup. However, the design isn’t too busy. I’m not used to the double flavor situation when it comes to yogurt: almond and vanilla or coconut and blueberry. I saw an almond on the side and thought, are there almonds in there? Then I realized it referred to the fact almonds were used to make it. To convince me to try a new brand of yogurt, it would need to look visually discernible from the other brands. Most yogurt cups use blue and/or white in their design. In a supermarket’s yogurt section, I think I’d need a pretty striking and unique package to even notice a new brand. Case in point, I’m lactose intolerant and didn’t even know non-dairy yogurt existed.
  
 
  
 I think it’s necessary to have clear, uncluttered messages on your packaging. If I feel like I’m reading an infomercial, I’m not going to buy the product. Keep messaging honest and concise. And try to avoid mysterious terms people aren’t familiar with (like yogurt alternative) because that can scare anyone away. 
  
 
  
 A fun and refined tone works the best for me. At the end of the day, I’m buying yogurt because I like the taste. I want to enjoy it. Buying my yogurt should be an enjoyable experience, too. I want to be excited to get to the yogurt section. If you keep that in mind along with the age/mentality of your demographic, I think it will produce a great tone. As I mentioned earlier, I really like noosa’s brand voice.
  
 
  
 There are several approaches to naming. I would definitely explore descriptive options because it’s a product type everyone isn’t familiar with. “Dairy-free yogurt” or something to that effect, may be helpful in accompanying the name. I think names describing taste and texture are also a great approach, both informative and culinary. I’m unsure to what level I want “almond” involved in the naming… On the one hand, this is being made with almonds. On the other hand, why would I buy yogurt from a company specializing in almonds? There may need to be some convincing there.
  
 
  
 As far as packaging goes, creative approaches to flavor communication always appeal to me. Oikos, Private Selection, Activia, and the small cups of noosa all grab my attention this way. I’d avoid exclusively selling attached cups though until there’s a built interest with consumers. I don’t want to buy four cups of something I’ve never tried and might not like. Deliciously Healthy It suggests that the yogurt is healthy and energizing, that it’s vegetarian, and that it’s a good snack for people watching their weight. 
 Mentioning the health benefits is a good idea. I think a good percentage of people who eat yogurt are health conscious to some degree. The energy angle (vitality/feel great and ready to go) is interesting too, as I usually don’t see that in yogurt marketing. The first sentence just sounds awkward to me. Maybe it’s the superiority claim or perhaps it’s just the phrasing of the second half. “Feeling full of vitality” is not something with which I can easily identify. Maybe full of energy? 
 What makes this the best-tasting non-dairy yogurt? That’s a bold claim for a new product. How does it make me feel energized? How does calcium help me feel great throughout the day? Light and smooth makes it seem like a whipped yogurt (I’m thinking of the light and fluffy Yoplait variety). Is it light or is it creamy? Honestly, I think I’d arrange the sentences differently. I don’t know how something being the best-tasting product gives you energy or how calcium helps you get through your day. I’d try talking about the taste and texture together and then lump the health benefits together. Not sure if that will read well but it would make more sense to me. It says, “This is superior to similar products” and assures people it tastes good even though it’s not ‘normal’ yogurt. It also indicates discerning taste by exclusively using specific almonds. By mentioning Blue Diamond, it inspires a level of comfort with a familiar brand. It says, “American made”. It tells me that even non-dairy yogurt can have the creamy taste that I’m looking for. To me, it also says vegan but I’m not 100% positive on that based on the description. It doesn’t say anything about the health benefits or nutrients. 
 
  
 I like the exclusivity implied by the beginning of the second sentence. It makes this yogurt sound special and elite, as if you considered all the ingredients you could use and chose only the very best. It also sounds honest because you’re telling me exactly where my food is coming from. Also, I love the “smooth and deliciously creamy” part because that’s what I’m looking for in a yogurt.
  
 
  
 “Uncompromised goodness” is kind of ambiguous. Are we referring to the healthiness of the product or its taste? If the former, what health benefits can I expect from this product? If the latter, it’s repetitive because we already mentioned “best tasting” earlier in the sentence.   
 
  
 From a personal standpoint, it makes me curious about the basis for other non-dairy yogurts. What are they normally made of? Is almondmilk yogurt new or different? As previously mentioned, I would like to know more about nutrients and health benefits of non-dairy yogurt, especially for someone who is lactose intolerant or on a restricted diet (i.e., vegetarian, vegan). Is this product vegan? Please note, I don’t think all of these things need to be in a positioning statement, they are just bits of information I’d like access to on the packaging.   
 
  
 Suggestions:
  
 Define “uncompromised goodness”. I don't know if it’s just me, but right now they sound like empty marketing words. They’re pretty words, but they hold no meaning for me.   
 I would also consider deleting the second mention of “non-dairy”. We’ve already stated this, and deleting the second mention would cut down on the wordiness at the end. It implies that taste does not have to be sacrificed to make healthy food. It also indicates that yogurt can still be creamy without dairy. Overall, it seems to combat the arguments against non-dairy yogurt while also referring to the health benefits. I like the juxtaposition of delicious and healthy. What more could you want? Also, the “at any time of day” is a nice way to point out possibilities. It makes the brand seem compatible with any lifestyle. 
 It is repetitive. We say “deliciously healthy” and later state “delicious and healthy”.
 
 Is this non-dairy yogurt healthier than other non-dairy yogurts? What makes it better?
 
 The first sentence seems unnecessary. I would delete it and possibly add something more specific about health benefits or nutrients. During part one, I realized that many companies call their similar products a “Yogurt Alternative”, which sounds terrible to me and awfully mysterious.  I think dairy-free yogurt would be a fine option. Maybe it doesn’t pass a lexicography test, but this is marketing—we’re not writing a dictionary. As a consumer I am perfectly comfortable with this labeling.
 Also, I think Cultured Almondmilk communicates the fact that it’s dairy-free without having to blatantly state it. It’s okay to put dairy-free somewhere on the packaging, but I’m not sure it’s needed in “Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk”. Overall, I think it’s a good workaround. I’d definitely want it to be contemporary and, if anything, more toward the playful side. I don’t see the benefit of the product being serious. There are so many people cutting back on dairy that you don’t need to market to a super serious audience with medical concerns. Include everyone. And I think playful does a better job of building a following than serious does. However, I’m not against the middle ground. Also, traditional just seems like the wrong way to describe this product. It’s new age. It’s improved. It may taste as great as traditional yogurt, but I think it should focus on being better and different. In order to keep the brand fun and modern, I would recommend embracing the dairy-free aspect in a positive light. It shouldn’t feel like someone has to settle for dairy-free; it should be the better option. Whether you play up the health aspect, taste or sustainability, this should come across as an improvement on traditional yogurt. 
 There are very few vibrant yogurt packages. I think the number one way to make your product stand out is to avoid putting it in a white container. The entire yogurt section at my store, with the exception of Activia, is color (mostly light blue) on white. I like noosa’s approach of letting the yogurt be the background but making the lids colorful.
 
 Noosa’s bold, funky font is also cool because it speaks to the quirky brand. I don’t think Blue Diamond should go for noosa quirky. It seems much closer to the middle of the playful–serious spectrum. However, I think a lot of brands waste the font. Your choice is going to depend on the chosen positioning statement. For example, the deliciously healthy statement could take on a scrumptious script or fit font whereas the UG statement may take on earthy tones and trustworthy type like Helvetica. 
 Overall, I’d say keep it simple. Busy packaging is the worst. All I need to know is the name of what I’m buying, the flavor and the nutrition facts. If you have extra selling points (like dairy-free, vegan or organic), throw the symbols on there. But I don’t want to spend five minutes reading a yogurt container.  
 Aside from that, my main concern would be allowing this product to look like everything else. If you set a container of Almond Breeze almond milk next to a cup of Silk almondmilk yogurt alternative, they look like cousins. I don’t even think I’d notice the difference while shopping. Make Blue Diamond stand out. It doesn't need to be obnoxious. It just has to be different.",Smoothie,
225819,Thei,Zervaki,tzervaki@hotmail.com,"Yogurt is for me a versatile, healthy snack that can be eaten on-the-go as well as at the table. This is its competitive edge because you can have it on the plane for example but you can also cook with it. During the last ten years in the USA, yogurt has been associated with Greek yogurt for some reason. There are various big players in the market in terms of brands like Fage, Dannon, Stonyfield, Chobani, Noosa and also private label brands from 365 Everyday Value and Trader  Joe's. Fage is top notch for me because it is the real Greek yogurt, strained made only with milk and cultures. The plain yogurt from some brands is equally good but most brands add stabilizers and additives that have non positive results. I don't like any fruit flavored yogurt as it is full with sugars. Taste and flavor are far more important to me than the brand and yes, I am willing to pay more to get better quality. I don't expect much from a yogurt pot that costs 99 cents like Yoplait: full with colors and sugars so is a NO. There is non-dairy yogurt made from almond milk, cashewsmilk and coconut milk. I don't particularly like any of those because those have lots of sugars. So again NO. When I buy yogurt, I want equal amount in protein and carbs. I read the label and when I see 24g of carbs and 3g protein, I don't get it. This is not yogurt. This is custard cream. Fage: I like it because it is real and authentic. It is more expensive than other brands but it is worth the money because it is a quality yogurt. Always in my fridge. The branding is simple and clear with one simple word Fage which means Eat in Greek. You don't need more than that. The packaging is simple as well, nothing fancy. So, in this case there is somewhat a correlation between authenticity with simplicity; the creamy texture goes well with the slightly tart taste. Made only with milk and cultures. All is good. 
 
 
 
 Dannon Oikos triple zero is another brand I like. It contains  3x protein and no added sugar. It is often in the fridge and it tastes good. This is a yogurt for specific palates targeting athletes, healthy eaters and those who just prefer protein to sugar. I definitely prefer the plain but the fruity ones are not bad. I find that the packaging is rather ""crowded"" but I think that the consumer gets the message.This is a case of a conscious healthy choice rather than physical (pack) beauty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Noosa. I bought it in the past. This is a typical example of great packaging with nice colors and graphics The brand name is appealing even if it does not mean anything really. However, the flavored yogurts are full with sugar and stabilizers and the yogurt is actually high in calories. The texture is creamy which is a positive element but the taste over the top sweet -good yogurt should have a tart taste so even the plain Noosa fails to deliver. It's a NO. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Siggis is a brand that I like and buy often. It is the Icelandic Skyr which is similar to Greek yogurt but slighter sweeter. The taste is great because it is the perfect balance between creaminess and thickness and tartness and sweetness. I like the brand with its amazing packaging -like a paper wrap. It clear and fine and simple and everybody gets what the product is about. 
 I don't like most of the  yogurts in the American market because they are not yogurts, are desserts. That statement says everything. Blue Diamond has some decisions to make: will the new yogurt be like a non-dairy yogurt or a non-dairy dessert? Will it have lots of sugars or not? Also, as often alternative products can be confusing for the average consumer, the new yogurt has to have a clear message on the pack: that it is not dairy. Blue Diamond has to make sure that the  new, not-dairy product has a CLEAR voice/message on the pack. Alternative products are often confusing. For example Macaroni & Cheese made from legumes like beans and chickpeas with  beans and chickpeas on the package. This is very confusing and in my opinion, a bad idea. Consumers do not know if this is beans or macaroni and if it is, how the product is made from? 
 I would even suggest that Blue Diamond should avoid the word yogurt because yogurt is dairy really. Almond yogurt is not the most successful term for such a product. Maybe a new word that will capture almond and something else but I have no creative ideas at present. A name that will reflect its own brand name, that's for sure. Maybe a foreign word for almond like the Greek /amygdalo/? 
 I also think that the packaging should be along the line with the BD brand and its unique packaging. Otherwise, it will be like a product from another brand. A blue and brown pot with the image of almonds is definitely the way to go.      ",Smoothie,ISTP
235035,Sean,Little,sean.patrick.little@gmail.com,"1. When I think of the yogurt category I honestly think first of Yoplait or Danon because growing up we always had them in the fridge. The colorful tops and the fruit in them. They tasted good but over time I realized that they were awful for you with crazy high levels of sugar. Now when I think of yogurt I think less of them and more of brands like Fage, Yakult, Siggi's (even though Siggis I feel has too much sugar, the claim its low but its 11g per serving when 8g per serving is about the max you should have). I still see Yoplait and Dannon etc. but if I ever have them I avoid the fruit ones and go plain or low fat. I also really really like Kefir which is like a yogurt drink. Again, anything flavored has a ridiculous amount of sugar in it which isn't cool so I avoid those and go plain and just drink it as is or maybe cut up some fruit and eat that with it so at least I'm getting the fiber with the sugar and not just pure sugar.  
 2. What I love about yogurt is it's a quick, nutritious breakfast and snack option. No real prep necessary and it's a great base pallet for more. I usually eat Greek yogurt of cereal for breakfast. If it's yogurt I use greek yogurt, a handful of mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, raisins cranberries), cinnamon and some honey on top. What I don't like about it is the sugar content levels or in the case of reduced fat the starch they add to it. My family has a history of diabetes and I want no part of that so I watch that stuff pretty strictly when I can.  
 3. I would be open to it but I would need to know a few things. 1. What's the sugar level? 2. What's the starch level? and for non dairy a big one for me is 3. How much water was used to make this? I grew up in CA and still go there very often so water conversation is a big deal to me. I know that almond milk takes a lot of water to make, so knowing the impact, along with ways the company helps mitigate waste and recycles to make sure the impact is as low as possible would be a big factor for me and many people I know.  
 4. Im willing to try new yogurts but I think the main things are the texture (is it thick? Runny?), taste (even though I usually go with a neutral plain yogurt Ive had ""plain""versions that tasted sweeter than cake icing and hated it), flavor I only use plain, and for brand I usually decide on a brand once Ive found one that meets my requirements from the above. And of course the sugar/starch levels. Those are pretty much number one for me before I choose anything else. If I see a yogurt that has anything over 10g of sugar per serving I'm putting it back to look for one with less.  
 5. Yes, if it met my needs. It depends though. I'm not going to pay $10 for a $5 size of yogurt if the yogurt is more expensive because it uses things I don't want or need. If it's because its full of sugary fruits or starches or because they use a process to make it that wastes tons of water then I'd give it a hard pass. If though it met all the needs and offered an additional benefit others didn't - more protein or even a clearly defined and transparent donation to water conservation efforts to help off set loss, I would. But with the later example They'd really have to be clear about it and not pull a ""we donate"" and then mark it up $5 and give $.25 for every five sold. When companies pull those type of tricks it turns me off from them. Just be transparent with it, people will know and decide. 2.  Like this brand, quick and easy, low sugar. 3. This has been in my fridge many times. 4. They are trying to say they are an easy, healthy quick snack or breakfast option. 5. I don't think Blue Diamond should emulate them, not what they're trying to do too much of a drink before yogurt just avoid it but notice that it's low in sugar. 6. Design wasn't super important to me here. I just got used to knowing that color was the one I wanted and the others were full of sugar.  2.  Im not a giant fan of this one due to how its advertising. I've tried store brands and they are ok, hit or miss. Always go low sugar but this one may not be low sugar, its a little deceptive. 3. This one has never been in my fridge. 4. They are trying to say they are a low sugar option but its deceptive. No sugar added could be they didn't add anymore to the 30g they already have. 5. I don't think Blue Diamond should emulate them, it seems deceptive to me. No sugar added means nothing. 6. Design was bad to me. It's purposely deceptive.  2.  Like this brand, quick and easy, low sugar. 3. This has been in my fridge many times. 4. They are trying to say they are an easy, healthy quick snack or breakfast option. 5. I think Blue Diamond should emulate them to some degree by having a clean package, low sugar otion and if its flavored trying to add as little sugar as possible. There's also people who are lactose intolerant to market to but I would imagine they are even more eagle eyed about their choices and notice things like sugar too. 6. Design is good, clean and stands out.    2.  Really like this brand, it's my favorite. It's a good size for a whole week or more, it's quick and easy, low in sugar and you can use it outside of breakfast for other cooking options too. 3. This is in my fridge now (only the total though or the next closest to whole milk, more sugars in non fat). 4. They are trying to say they are total/complete breakfast option with protein in it. 5. I think Blue Diamond should emulate them by putting the benefits front and center in a clean way. 6. Design is great, it's clean and says what it should. I think they should differentiate their different designs more between 0% to whole though.     2.  Like this brand. Not a meal but it offers something different with the cultures. Healthy gut culture is really important to overall health. 3. This has been in my fridge many times. 4. They are trying to say they are a quick ""shot of better health"". 5. I think Blue Diamond should emulate them by having active cultures in the yogurt 6. Design is good, clean and stands out especially because of size and packaging.  2.  Don't like this brand. Not a giant fan of taste but its ok. Mainly don't like how the whole milk version starts at 10g sugar a serving. 3. This has been in my fridge once. 4. They are trying to say they are healthy and family owned which I like but they don't get into why they have more sugar than other whole milk options or what makes Russian style yogurt different.  5. I think Blue Diamond shouldn't emulate them 6. Design is good, they do a good job making it seem ""old world"" etc but feel they leave out benefits.    2.  Don't like this brand. Too much sugar, gross.  3. This has been in my parents fridge but not mine. 4. They are trying to say they are healthy but the sugar content is crazy high it's misleading.  5. I think Blue Diamond shouldn't emulate them 6. Design is flashy and makes people want to grab it but it's garbage yogurt. 1. I would say make it as healthy and eco conscious as you can, and explain the benefits of this yogurt clearly over the others. People went to Greek yogurt because of protein in it because it was a health benefit and I'm sure they can do the same.  
 2. Again, I'd say appeal to the people who are non dairy and then highlight the benefits of including non dairy into a daily meal, or how they provide the benefits of the dairy without the actual dairy in it.  
 3. I would say friendly and to the point. People don't want to have a 10 min read in the yogurt area. Just be transparent and friendly about the product, why it was created and what it's benefits are and it would be great.  
 4. That's hard I'm not sure. Maybe ""Non Dairy Yogurt"" or ""Yogurt...minus the cows"". Something fun could be interesting to make it stand out. Also appeals to veg vegans as well so theres that audience.  
 5. Something clean with concise wording and labeling on it to highlight how it works and why it works. I think the top lid though, or peel off tin, should have an ""almond""pattern on it to make it looks like you're getting the yogurt out o an almond and drive home that's what you're buying. Uncompromised Goodness 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? That it's healthy for you, its a pleasant and still dairy like texture and has many of the pro's of dairy without the downsides some people experience.  2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. It hits a lot of good points that could attract people 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? I think it tries to do too much and the wording feels a little clumsy. Two shorter, simpler sentences would be better here I feel. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? Hard to say but I (personally) always wonder about eco impact with products like this. 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? It would be hard to change this positioning statement to include my concern but perhaps adding, eco-friendly plant based would do it. 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? 
 
 That's it non dairy but has dairy qualities to it in taste and texture. That the almonds are grown with the best almonds out there in eco friendly ways. 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. 
 That it calls to mind a quality product raised in a quality, eco friendly way. 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? 
 I like that the other one says ""healthy experience anytime of day"" to point out its not just for breakfast. 
 4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? 
 Nothing 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? 
 This one touches on the issue I had with the others. 1. Please read the positioning description below. What are all the things that this description makes you think about that are not mentioned explicitly? What has been left unsaid? 

 Again, that it has dairy like qualities without dairy. This speaks more to it being a healthy, anytime snack though in suggesting how to consume it. 
 2. What do you believe is a strength of this positioning description? Tell us why. I like that it's short and to the point. I like that it uses ""healthy experience anytime of day"" 
 3. What do you believe is a weakness of this positioning description? How might this be overcome? I am not a big fan of ""the most"" statements as its so subjective, unless this is the only product of its kind then I think you should say that.  4. What questions does this description raise for you or what more you would like to know? Again, the eco question with the product. 
 5. What changes would improve this positioning description. How would these changes help? I keep harping on this one point but I know you cant always include it. Maybe something about the growing process elsewhere on the package that includes this info? 1. In Part 1, some of you raised questions about whether or not it is right to use the term ‘yogurt’ when the product is non-dairy. If this product wasn’t a known as a yogurt, what else might it be called? Non Dairy Yogurt. 
 Further Questions: 
 2. An idea that was shared is to call it “Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk”. What do you think of this? Not that big a fan, too wordy. 
 3. What are the alternatives to “Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk”. How would you improve on it? I would just call it almond milk yogurt or yogurt and show how yogurt isn't in the ingredients but the experience or feeling you get. 1. Below is a visual representation of various yogurt brands that are currently available in stores. The axes range from playful to serious and from traditional to contemporary. Where would you most like to see Blue Diamond's new product positioned on this quadrant and why? I think contemporary leaning for sure, more towards playful though. Not traditional as its not and its yogurt, its not serious. 
 Related Questions: 
 2. What advice do you have that could help Blue Diamond position their new brand where you would most like to see it?  I would put it in the dairy section or close by it with the soy and almond milk. 
 3. How could they use colour, typeface, imagery and symbols to achieve this? Please upload images that would help us to understand the look and feel you’d like Blue Diamond to adopt.  I think Fage yogurt does a good job of this and has something that's both serious but not too serious. Clean, bold typeface and simple imagery with a plain background would be my advice.  
 4. Would these design ideas work equally well for each of the three positioning descriptions? Are there any watch-outs for Blue Diamond to keep in mind? I think they would. I wouldn't really tell them to ""watch out"" for anything except making claims about the product or its production that aren't true.",Smoothie,
198777,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"1. First thing, I don’t think about drinkable yogurt too much. Seems a little weird to me. I know it exists, but when I think about yogurt, I think about spoonable yogurt, or frozen yogurt. If I want spoonable yogurt, I’ll go find a mango lassi or something (which may or may not be yogurt.)
 
 I don’t know that I’m terribly familiar with a bunch of brands. I think of Dannon and Yoplait as standards. Fage seems like it’s very popular in the Greek yogurt category. I also enjoy various yogurt brands at Trader Joe’s.
  
 2. I love yogurt because it mixes well with so many things. I also think about it as a good source of protein. It's not great when it's loaded up with sugar. You might as well be eating ice cream at that point. 
 3. Lately, I purchase more dairy-based yogurt than non-dairy because I haven’t really had great experiences with non-dairy yogurts. The texture wasn’t quite there, yet. 
 4. I find that I’m willing to give almost any brand a try, but these days I generally base my purchase on the sugar content – it’s gotta be low. Any yogurt can be tasty if it has 26g of sugar per serving. 
 5. As far as paying a premium, I’m definitely more willing to experiment and buy a new brand if I see an interesting flavor – figs with honey, for example. I’m a sucker for new and interesting flavor combinations. 1.  What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? I like the taste of this brand. They have a lot of good flavors that are all a little bit more on the adventurous side. I believe one of the other flavors right next to it was ""toasted coconut."" 
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? No, but I've had it at various functions or promotional events. I'm certainly not opposed to trying it at home, but just haven't. 
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?  They're ""normalizing"" Greek yogurt. To me, it seems like Greek yogurt has already become a mainstay, but I think that for people who are more used to the runny consistency of traditional yogurt, the difference in consistency might still need to be an educational selling point. With Chobani, they're just like, ""We're here. We're Greek. Get used to it."" 
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?  Adventurous flavors, bold logo design, practical single-serve containers. 
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? This one was one of the first yogurts to jump out at me, so I think the bright colors and bold logo work very well. If I had any complaint, it would be to make whatever that ""2"" is on the side of the container convey a more readable message: Is it two servings? I had to look closely to see that it was ""2% milk fat."" 2.  What do you love (or dislike) about the brand?  Fage was probably the first Greek yogurt I was ever aware of or tasted. I like it and it's still around, so I support it. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? Yes. I like the consistency and taste. It's my standard-bearer as a great but simple Greek yogurt brand.  
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?  I think they're confident in their product and don't try to obscure that message with lots of fancy flavors or taglines. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?  Become the standard in your category by which all others are measured. (Easy, right?) They should avoid choosing a name that most people will continue to say wrong until the end of time, and also sounds offensive when you say it incorrectly. 
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? I don't actually think the logo design or color scheme is all that hot, but I've come to the conclusion (however incorrectly), that if a logo sticks around long enough -- however ugly -- it'll become iconic. I think this is where we are with Fage's logo. 3.  What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
  
 It's a name that I trust. When we were doing research on brands of organic milk to give to our baby, we arrived at Horizon and have found them to be consistently high-quality.
  
 
  
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
  
 
  
 Yes. Because I trust the milk and will go ahead and put my faith in their entire dairy line. J
  
 
  
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
  
 
  
 Horizon is all about selling that cute cow, in all his cartoon-ness, playing around a cartoon Earth. This is fine. Maybe they know they’re popular with parents. Maybe they know if they’re low enough on the shelf (which they were), kids will see the cartoon cow and grab the yogurt for themselves.
  
 
  
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
  
 
  
 If you can come up with an animal that can become aligned with the non-dairy sector as well as cows are aligned with milk and yogurt, do that. BUT, I would avoid trying too hard. I think a milk-alternative yogurt is going to appeal to the eco-conscious first (parents and otherwise), which will then trickle down to the kids.
  
 
  
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
  
 
  
 Hey, I like the cute cartoon cow! So many yogurt containers are white and this one is red, so it’s eye-catching. They’re selling the “organic” label conspicuously, which is obviously a good move and something people will be looking for. Given the choice between an organic and non-organic product, I will almost always pick the organic one, even if it’s a Twinkie. I suspect there are a lot of people out there like me. 
   4. 
  
 What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
  
 
  
 Siggi’s! I love that it’s a different kind of yogurt. Icelandic! What does that even mean? I’ve had this stuff and I don’t know that I could tell you, except that it’s more like Greek yogurt than regular yogurt. I like to try new things, and this is new, so I’ve tried it.
  
 
  
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
  
 
  
 Yes. I thought I’d give it a whirl. I probably like Greek yogurt better.
  
 
  
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? 
  
 
  
 “If you love Greek yogurt but don’t think it’s adventurous enough, try us!” It feels like a cheeky upstart brand.
  
 
  
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? 
  
 
  
 If you’re a challenger brand, I don’t think a little bit of quirk ever hurt to draw attention to yourself, as long as it’s tasteful.
  
 
  
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
  
 
  
 I really like their design. The lowercase letters and the hand-drawn fruits make for an appealing package. They’re also very upfront about not having anything artificial in their yogurt (or Icelandic-style cream skyr, whatever that is.)
   5. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 Annie’s has a good reputation among those who care about such things for making tasty, certified-organic food. 
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 No. I actually didn’t know that Annie’s made yogurt until I went into the yogurt aisle today. 
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?  
 I think for Annie’s, the message is all about the quality associated with the brand and how all of their products are “certified organic.” They’re a good example of a brand that feels like they might be making their product in a farm just down the road from you (but they’re owned by Unilever for all I know). 
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?  
 Again, whether or not it’s true, that label that says “homegrown” is selling me on a vision of the company I have bought into. The closer Blue Diamond can get to that pastoral vision of a neighborhood farm, the better.    
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 I’m kind of ‘eh’ on the purple and green color scheme, but it’s eye catching. BUT, there’s a cuddly cartoon bunny on the container! I can see my three-year-old making a bee-line for this yogurt! What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? AND NOW FOR BRANDS I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH... 
 What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 
 I hate that it’s apparently a yogurt drink masquerading as kid’s toy. 
 
 
 
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
 
 Noooo. I’m offended that the flavor is Cotton Candy, mostly because I assume that it’s packed with sugar, and also that it feels pandering. Obviously, I like cute cartoon characters on the container, but there is apparently a limit.
 
 
 
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?  
 
 “Do you want a hyper kid? Then do we have something for you!” I assume this brand advertises during kids’ animation programming blocks on Cartoon Network. 
 
 
 
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?  
 
 DO: Figure out a fun mascot. DON’T: Make it a cool monkey. 
 
 
 
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
 
 It’s slick and commercial, but too much so. I wouldn’t buy it (for myself or my daughter) because it feels like they’re selling something other than yogurt/smoothie. I’d rather try the Icelandic yogurt for something a little off the beaten path.
 What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? 
 
 I hate that it seems like it’s just a container filled with M&Ms.
  
 
  
 Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? 
  
 No, because I’m not into buying candy instead of yogurt. 
  
 
  
 What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?  
  
 “We have M&M!s If you want to pretend you’re doing something healthy while you’re also eating M&Ms, try us! (Also, we have Oreos in another container.) 
  
 
  
 What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?  
  
 They should avoid everything this brand does, except maybe the part where they say that they’re a good source of calcium. Probably true, but irksome. Shouldn’t they also be forced to say that they’re a good source of sugar, too? 
  
 
  
 What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well? 
  
 I don’t like the design because the brown made me think it was coffee-flavored, which I do like. It’s vanilla! Why would you do that?! Main Question: 
  
 1.     Based on all you know and have shared about existing yogurt brands, what advice do you have for how Blue Diamond might develop a brand that you’d love to try? 
  
 
  
 I would focus on developing a brand that sells me on originality of flavors, concern for the environment, and a nutritional equivalency to dairy brands.
  
 
 
 
  
 More Specifically: 
  
 2.     How might Blue Diamond ensure their  non-dairy  brand stands out (in a good way!)? 
  
 Interesting flavors or a price point that inspires me to give them a shot. I know that non-dairy cheeses tend to be way more expensive than dairy cheeses, so I know an expensive product might be a turn-off to some people who might otherwise be willing to experiment with the non-dairy version. 
  
 
  
 3.     What personality or tone of voice should it have? Do you have any examples? 
  
 
  
 Something light and fun, like, “Hey, you like you’re health-conscious and an adventurous eater! Why not give us a try!” Seems like trying to be hifalutin and serious would be a mistake. 
  
 
  
 4.     What types of name would you like Blue Diamond to consider? 
  
 
  
 “Almond Dairy Alternative,” “Non-Dairy Almond Yogurt,” “Yogurt style almond cream”
  
 
  
 5.     What packaging design ideas do you think could really elevate this brand? 
  
 The blue color in Blue Diamond is a good way in, but I think they might need a picture just to show people that they’re not buying a big tub of almonds. Making the connection to nature and plants and farmland is also a great move. Deliciously Healthy 1. It's a tasty source of calcium, but how *much* calcium? Is it on par with a dairy option? Are the other protein and nutrients on par with dairy versions of yogurt? 2. Bringing up the calcium content is helpful because people may wonder what's missing compared to ""traditional"" dairy yogurt. 3. ""It gives you all you need"" may be a weakness because I wonder what exactly it is that I need, if it's not more explicitly explained.  4. I would like to know more about the nutritional content of this yogurt.  5. Perhaps an attempt to offer some parity, nutritionally, between this non-dairy yogurt and regular dairy yogurt, like, ""As much calcium and protein in most leading dairy yogurts!"" (or something along those lines -- ""Naturally lower in sugar than dairy yogurt!"" 1. ""Uncompromised goodness"" gives me a happy, non-specific feeling but makes me wonder exactly what that goodness is. 2. ""Smooth and deliciously creamy"" is a big plus of this description because I may be more inclined to buy into a new kind of yogurt based on perceived mouthfeel alone. That sounds sarcastic but it's not.  3. Again, I find the phrase ""uncompromised goodness"" squishy enough that it could mean anything, yet doesn't mean anything at all. On the devil's advocate side of the coin, I live in California and therefore I find the idea of ""California growers"" appealing, but some people may not like California, in which case it might be worth considering something like ""personally selected"" or ""artisanal"" growers. 4. Does calling something yogurt mean that it has probiotics? 5. Using the term ""non-dairy"" a second time in the second sentence feels a little redundant, especially since you have ""plant-based"" in there to reinforce the point. 1. What makes this yogurt healthy, exactly? When I think of ""healthy"" yogurt, I think of yogurt without lots of sugar, which is what I would expect of any yogurt labeling itself as healthy.  2. The word ""healthy"" is a plus, but that claim should be backed up by ""low sugar"" or ""protein-packed."" 3. One two many uses of the word ""healthy"" and that second sentence is a little overwhelmed by adjectives and adverbs describing the yogurt.  4. Again, why makes this yogurt so healthy that you have to mention it twice? 5. I'd go simpler, more direct: The most delicious and healthy non-dairy yogurt. Our luxuriously creamy almond milk yogurt is a delicious snack anytime of day! 1. Hmm. I didn't raise this question because I didn't feel like it was really necessary to create a new term for non-dairy foods. I eat nut-based cheese and I think everybody is fine calling it ""cheese."" What else could you call it? A cream, maybe? 2. It's okay. Feels too complicated. I think the reality is that most people don't really think about yogurt being cultured milk, so you might be reminding them of something they don't want to think about. 3. Cultured Almond Cream, Smooth Almond Cream? Doesn't really nail it, but at least you could take the ""Almondmilk"" part of the equation out and streamline the naming convention a bit. The ""Dairy-Free"" identifier should probably just be a starburst on the packaging or something. 1. I think a more playful and contemporary look would best suit Blue Diamond's new packaging, something closer to Noosa or Chobani so that it's more easily identifiable as a new brand/type of yogurt. 2. If the name ends up being kind of generic, then the packaging and logo should be all the more eye-catching. Maybe a cartoon character, like a cow sitting on a beach enjoying a well-earned vacation.  3. With that said, CHICK-FIL-A did the cow thing first, but they still have to contend with the fact that their product uses animals, and an Almond milk yogurt product is totally (hopefully) vegan. Still, this is a great, playful ad campaign, and obviously very eye-catching. 4. A lighter, more playful design would probably work fine for two out of the three positioning descriptions, but a more premium positioning would likely benefit from some more adult fonting and color choices.",Smoothie,
198809,Sandy,Kane,madamekane@yahoo.com,"1. I am a huge fan of yogurt of all types (does that include kefir? I hope so, b/c I try to have kefir daily for the probiotics). I TRY to go for unsweetened/plain and add my own toppings for breakfast, but often indulge in the sweet varieties because deep down I'm a sugar addict. 2. I love that yogurt has great health properties like protein and probiotics; that it's portable and a great on-the-go option when you don't have time for a proper meal; and a sassy dessert when you want something sweet and creamy and comforting at the end of a crazy day. Not so great: lactose (I'm intolerant, boo!) and loads of sugar (I know I just contradicted myself, but that's the world we live in, get used to it.) 3. I am happy to report I tried - for the first time - some non-dairy yogurt yesterday and loved it. I seriously doubt I would have even ventured into that territory on my own, so I have SWW to thank for pushing me beyond my self-imposed limits.Technically speaking, if something is not made with traditional ingredients, is it still 'the thing'? ie if you make a product with almonds or coconut, is it OK to call it yogurt (which by definition is 'a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.' Maybe a dumb questions but I had to ask.  4. Attributes when choosing - definitely brand because by choosing brands I've already tried and know I like, I will be assured great taste, texture and flavor. There are brands that I definitely do NOT like and they are; Dannon, Yoplait, and store-generic. 5. What justifies paying more for premium? Taste, texture (more creamy texture, less gelatinous) and knowing the product is made with high quality ingredients and standards. Added probiotics would be in that category too. NOOSA: love the creamy texture and wild, kind of silly but grown-up flavors like Strawberry & Hibiscus; Pear & Cardamom and Blood Orange. I think they make wonderful desserts, but typically too sweet for me for a breakfast item. OUI by Yoplait - not a fan of traditional Yoplait, but these are super good and I love the European feel of the little glass jars. Grown-up baby food, man. Icelandic and Liberte - both pricey so unless on sale I typically don't buy them, but I do like the flavors and texture of these premium brands. My premium GOLD STANDARD is Fage plain with honey. A great breakfast with added granola and fresh berries. YUM! 
 Tried the vanilla SILK Almondmilk product yesterday and really like it!! The name, however, is a little, how does one say, reminiscent of a personal lubricant, no? 
 M n M's and Oreo yogurt? Why bother, just go to the snack isle and get the REAL junk. Why to people buy this crap? To make themselves feel like they are feeding themselves (or worse, their children) good food? Cringe. 1-2. I trust the name Blue Diamond (consistently great, I've never had a bad experience with any of their items) and feel they would hire the best minds to come up with a really great almond milk yogurt. How to make it stand out?  Here are the yogurts that made it home with me yesterday. The brightly colored packaging really stands out against the sea of white, right? I noticed most premium brands use a white background. I like what Chobani is doing with the mint green and cocoa brown for that mint chocolate flavor, it really caught my eye and as I like those flavors together I'm going to have it for a dessert. So, I'd consider either going for a consistently-colored package like Silk, or mixing it up and creating labels that connote the flavors within. 3. Tone: I think it should be a tad playful (the Silk packaging is straight-up boring, in my opinion) but not as wacked-out as Noosa. Something more akin to Oui or Chobani in style/tone. I have no idea if you are going after the 'kid' market, but for God's sake, if you do, don't add all the candy and crap! Unless that's what really sells... sigh, I don't know. Our love/hate of sugar will be the undoing of our race, I fear. 4-5. Types of names: I suppose that depends on who BD is targeting: rich yuppies/ lactose-intolerant millenials / health-conscious aging Boomers? Thank God 'Silk' is already taken, haha!... 
How about 'Blossom' - I googled Almond Blossom and the top hit was a gorgeous painting by Vincent Van Gogh. How gorgeous is this? White blossoms on a cerulean blue background? BOOM! ...you're welcome. :D Honestly, if I were coming up with a design for this, I would totally use these colors - look at those gorgeous greens Van Gogh used in the branches of the tree, it makes the thing look alive, like it's growing right toward you. I love the idea of GROWTH, because healthy foods help us grow. And for vegans and folks who refuse to eat animal products, I think they would really connect to the growing plant motif. And this style would also appeal to the upper crust/ art snob/ hyper-educated consumer who would relate ART with great design and great taste! Deliciously Healthy This one is my least favorite. Again, I do not really like things that start with 'the best'... I appreciate knowing almondmilk is a good source of calcium (is it, compared to dairy yogurt?), but I don't think a product can claim to 'give you all you need to feel great and ready to go throughout the day', that is stretching it! I'd prefer something like:  Our great tasting non-dairy yogurt alternative has a perfectly light and smooth texture. It is a good source of calcium, and a tasty pick-me-up any time of day! Again, I'd get rid of 'best tasting' and say 'great tasting'. It sounds less contrived. The rest of the info is OK, as far as providing information. I'm not convinced you need 'plant-based' here, since most people understand that non-dairy and almondmilk = a product that is produced from almonds, which are plants. So I'd recommend losing 'plant-based' as it seems redundant. I think there are too many instances of 'delicious' in this text. And you repeat 'non-dairy'. I'd swap 'experience' (which could be a massage or a punch in the face) for 'treat'. How about: The most deliciously healthy non-dairy yogurt around. Our smooth and luxuriously creamy cultured almondmilk is a satisfying and healthy treat any time of day! I already suggested Alt/Yogurt - it's a bit fun... but maybe too funky for traditionalists.  I think Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk is fine and perfectly descriptive, I have no problem with it.  I also like Almond Bliss (but just Googled it and realize it's already taken, too bad!) I think Almond Breeze Dairy-Free Cultured Almondmilk is great. Definitely recognizable and perfectly descriptive. My favorite is the 'contemporary' look - see examples above. I like the simple packaging style, it's classy and easily stands out in the crowded supermarket shelf! The colors are nice too, easy to spot on the shelf. Having said that, I know Blue Diamond is a far more traditional brand, and will likely want to keep their new product range within that branding standard. If they do, I hope they will at least use some interesting/fun colors on the packaging to make the almondmilk product stand out. I would look closely at what competitors are doing in terms of color, illustration style and font choices. It will be interesting to see what the product designers come up with, because to stay within the traditional brand and still come up with something innovative and fresh will be a big challenge.  The biggest watch-out for Blue Diamond is: please, don't just make it your typical run-of-the-mill packaging, I swear it will get lost in the shuffle. Do try to make something contemporary that appeals to all different ages and diets!",Smoothie,
225817,Susan,Moon,smoon1211@gmail.com,"Yogurt makes me think of having a healthy gut. It evokes a 'healthy snack', one that is not very filling but is a hold-over to the next snack. I usually associate it with morning time. I also think of it as a substitute when cooking (for sour cream, for mediterranean food, for baking, etc). The different players that come to mind: there is the old, irrelevant version of yogurt ( i.e. yoplait, danone, La Yogurt?), then there's the ""now"" yogurts (i.e. Fage, Trader joe's greek yogurt, Chobani), then there's the locally loved yogurts (i.e. Noosa), and then I believe there's a next wave yogurt movement ready to happen for yogurts to reinvent their ingredients, or consistency (i.e. whipped), or format / perception (i.e. chia seeds / Le Pain Quotidien gourmet yogurt, dessert-type yogurt).

2. I love that yogurt is creamy, usually light. I don't love how many grams of sugar are in all yogurts, or when yogurts try too hard to be a certain flavor (i.e. strawberry, so it's pink and has strawberry chunks, but almost artificially so. Trying too hard to be strawberry).  3. A dairy yogurt, I think is heavy and creamy, and a good substitute for sour cream. A non-dairy yogurt, I think could be lighter (but not watery), and more nutritious / less crap in it. I wonder if a non-dairy yogurt could get an earthier taste (close to, but not hummus).  4. When choosing yogurt I consider texture - I like whipped, light textures. I consider price point of course (usually buy quality brands that are on sale). I usually think of the yogurt itself as more of a base to add flavors to, rather than the yogurt being the flavor itself (i.e. vanilla or white yogurt, or yogurt that has a separate flavor that you mix together). Brand, I will usually choose a brand that I know or have heard of rather than generic or unknown brand (i.e. Fage, Trader Joe's, Chobanis). 5. When yogurts start piquing my different perceptions (i.e. dessert, or gourmet, or nostalgia), that's when I become a sucker and buy the premium stuff. I.e. I love Starbucks' Lemon Chiffon Yogurt - it tastes delicious, like a dessert, it's light, and the font / word chiffon makes it sound like a dream. I'm also a sucker for trying yogurts like Siggi's where the packaging is beautiful and nostalgic feeling. But it's hard to justify expensive prices on a weekly basis. I go to these when it's more of a treat for myself. What may make the case for premium yogurt is if the ingredients truly are next-wave, healthy, plain good for you stuff. 2. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? Disclaimer - haven't tried it, but i love the claim that it makes ""Icelandic"". Like the risk it took to have a differently shaped package, and different color scheme. Don't love the multiple words that make it not 100% unintelligible (what does Icelandic yogurt mean? What is provisions mean aside from being a hipster word these days? What is skyr?) 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not?
 No. I actually buy bigger yogurt tubs now, not these small ones (unless I'm about to hop on a bus or plane and need something to-go). 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?
 The brand is trying to make some kind of claim and tap into the 'purity / unadulterated' perception by tapping into ""Icelandic"". I associate glacial water, lots of white palette, light tasting.  5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?
 Blue Diamond could think about emulating something unique about package shape, and have a simple yet differentiating claim. They should also think about tapping into some perceptual cues (i.e. is almond yogurt thin or thick? If thin, having a claim that draws ""light and thin "" connotations (i.e. Icelandic), or if it's thick, borrowing from other categories (i.e. see Kiehl's Shea butter, jojoba oil body butter creams, how do they communicate to make thickness appealing?) 6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well
 Like I said, like the differently shaped package, the different color scheme. Would try to ensure Blue Diamond's color scheme is in line with the texture and thickness of the actual yogurt (i.e. if it's thick, maybe that yellow color, if its thin than crisp whites, light blues....etc). 
 
 2. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? Love siggis. Love the beautiful labels. Love the fonts used. Evokes an expensive yet pleasant morning at Pain de Quotidien. It's so elegant, sophisticated, while feeling down-home, cozy, farm-to-tabley.  
 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? No - have only bought the small ones on the go (airport / bus). I actually don't do flavored yogurts much anymore, so i like to stick to plain (not even vanilla). Since i think of yogurt as a base, i feel like what I add to the yogurt i am willing to spend more money on, but not the base itself on a regular basis. 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand?
 As I said above, the brand seems to be trying to go back to its origins, and also tap into positive associations ""Swedish style"" - you know how we are suckers for those types of claims, some European credibility, like Ikea of yogurt - clean, minimal, sophisticated, makes me look good.  5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid?
 Blue Diamond could think about looking cross category at how different brands achieve that ""farm to table"" look, and do it well. What do their labels look like, what kind of fonts do they use, what kind of images do they use. The front of Siggi's is a clean breakdown of what is happening inside the bottle (i.e. probiotics, 0% milkfat, etc). They should avoid trying to look like every other yogurt brand as it relates to the same color schemes, same format. I think Blue Diamond could even do a better job than Siggi's at simplifying the claims and label too (Siggi's has a lot going on in terms of writing on the label).  6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well
 Like the ""matte' look of the Siggis (not shiny / glossy) - gives it a premium look. love the stylized fonts (all lowercase, all uppercase, etc). Love the one simple visual (vanilla flower).  On a separate note, I love that Chobani's has become more than just a yogurt brand. They do so much for the community, and the founder has an incredible story and support other startups.  
 2. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? Noosa - used to love it. I used to live in Colorado, which is Noosa's home. That local bent evoked all the other positive connotations with local - i.e. healhty, etc. Actually I later found just how much sugar is in each tub (a ton), and felt turned off and foolish for assuming ""local"" meant healthy.  
 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? It has in the past. Used to buy it on sale in Colorado 2/$6. Treated it as a good morning snack. But now, I do not buy it anymore because of the sugar content, and it's really not doing much innovative in the way of taste or health or beyond. 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? The brand is trying to be fun, creative, colorful. That's great. It also has an intriguing name (noosa) which evokes curiosity (i.e. where is noosa from?).  5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? Blue Diamond has the leeway to decide what kind of look it wants. Is blue diamond a ""fun"" brand? A creative one? An elegant one? An accessible one? And based on those questions, tap into a color scheme, font, name that is ""Blue Diamond"". What I know of Blue diamond, it feels pretty traditional and clean, reliable. I wonder if the Blue Diamond yogurt could be a space that Blue diamond could branch out since the format of yogurt itself is innovative. Explore another corner of the Blue diamond brand personality.  6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well The color pops work well. The unique flavors (i.e. coconut / lemon) are exemplified by the colors used on packaging. The small tub format is also unique, and not common on the yogurt shelf.  2. What do you love (or dislike) about the brand? Yoplait - outdated. Reminds me of childhood. Reminds me of skin / side lip cuts from liking the foil cover, trying to get all the yogurt out of that teeny opening.  
 3. Has this brand actually made it into your refrigerator? If so, why? If not, why not? Not since I was a child. It hasn't made any effort to get with the times (name, logo, images - all look pretty similar to what it looked like 10 years ago). I just assume they put the same crap in it that they used to 10 years ago. 4. What is the brand trying to say? What messages do you associate with the brand? Brand is trying to say ""we don't need to even try"". Brand is saying ""we don't take pride in our product, we are the cheapest yogurt on the shelf, we are the mcdonalds of yogurts that you can buy 10-15 of to feed your kids when you are in a pinch"" 5. What might Blue Diamond think about emulating? What should they avoid? Blue Diamond should avoid using the same tired yogurt themes / tropes. Get away from the red-white colors, the blue-white-green color schemes. Make sure the yogurt is easily scoopable instead of having a narrow opening. Find some way to add value to the yogurt experience. Also, buying single yogurt cups can be wasteful in terms of packaging.  6. What aspects of its design do you like and why? What doesn’t work so well Does not work for the reasons mentioned above (see above). Would advise Blue Diamond to play up the heritage / reliability brand, but with a fresh twist / angle. There's no reason to put a innovative yogurt on the market using the same old look. This seems like an amazing chance to stand out on the shelf, draw the eyes, make it something that people want to talk about / take pictures of. Do away with that old Jamie-lee curtis yogurt spoof, and make yogurt the coveted thing for health-minded people. Non-dairy brand - i think put the almond right on the front of the package. Make sure it is SUPER clear that this is a NON dairy yogurt. Look at RX bar or OGX shampoo or Vosge's chocolate. They all tout their ingredients front and center, no guessing. The raw material right there.   Almondcréme....i.e. something that evokes ""european"", and the texture of the yogurt (i.e. is it thick? is it light?). Look at different Almond products on the market (including in cosmetics / hair) to see how it is conveyed. Some kind of play on the almond shape? Or at least almond shape barcode? Whatever the shape, it should have some coherency with the purpose of the non-dairy yogurt. Healthy Vitality This conjures up an active lifestyle, energized and positive. I like that forward momentum of the words (i.e. full of vitality, ready to go). It still doesn't describe the flavor to me.  The claims made are pretty strong - full of vitality, perfectly light and smooth texture, tasty source of calcium - these are the best parts of the description. They convey a sense of benefit and sensory description of the actual yogurt. An opportunity for this description i think would be to get even more specific - about taste, about benefit tied to the almond.  This almost sounds like it's an energy booster, and calcium booster, so I'd like to know the logic / composition behind that. Also,would like to know the certifications. More elaboration on taste, certifications, ingredients that cause vitality / calcium boost. The description conjures up images of green fields in California, and creamy / cloudy textures. What is left out: creamy heavy or whipped light? and what is the flavor like? does it have any certification labels i.e. organic? What DOES almond yogurt taste like for someone that has only had dairy yogurt? Does it taste nutty? earthy?  Strength of positioning - Blue Diamond almonds from our California growers. This is the strength because it lends credibility of Blue Diamond brands and quality of almonds, and also attests to a relationship that BD has with California growers. Also like ""non-dairy, plant based almond milk yogurt"". Simple and straightforward way to differentiate the product. Weakness - uncompromised goodness - still hung up on what that means. Break that down for me. Does that mean it's non-GMO, organic, etc etc.... also rather than saying its ""best tasting"" I'd rather the description make my mouth water with specific ingredients mentioned like what kind of almond is it? a specific kind? and how does that type of almond taste compared to others? And does eating almonds have some kind of benefit that may not be had by eating dairy yogurt? like do almonds have healthy fats?  Again - certification labels, taste flavor profile, weight of yogurt Again - all the changes mentioned above I think would help the product description to be sharper, and help me get the idea faster - by using flavor cues, I'd be able to imagine tasting the yogurt quicker than just reading ""best tasting"". And the certification labels would feel more concrete than a marketing speak ""uncompromised goodness"". This conjures up generic milk product images. Like parmalat or soy milk, the front of the cover uses the boring traditional blue, and with a image of splashing milk. A lot missing here for me - it feels like it's not saying anything much, but using a lot of fluffy words. Strength would be that it's a good start to helping visualize the consistency....i.e. luxuriously creamy. But still, it doesn't give me an indicator if its heavy or light.... Feels very general, almost like 90s commercial - with generic statements like 'healthy experience at any time of day'. also ""most deliciously healthy"" feels like bad writing. I'd want to know - what makes it delicious and healthy - again, the flavor? the quality of almond? Less generic, more specific please! Hmm. First thing that comes to mind is Kefir - that's something I recognize as a non-dairy yogurt. I see 'yogurt alternative' being used as a yogurt term, but I actually dont like that because it sounds like 'fake yogurt'. I'd prefer to see 'dairy- free yogurt' instead. Maybe almond creme?  Not a fan....too many multi-syllabic words..... and almondmilk just makes me thing of the almond breeze milk in the milk boxes.  I think keep it simple - Almondmilk - cultured & dairy free. sleek and beautiful. like New barn almond milk, where they make your mouth water with the beautiful packaging and simplicity that mimics the simple, clean taste of their almondmilk. Feel like Blue Diamond is in the bottom right quadrant. Would like them to see in top right quadrant. It's beautiful yet still has that heritage feel that Blue Diamond brings.  Go for premium cues - stay away from those traditional greens, blues, whites. Siggis and Kite Hill have that nice premium white and black sleekness. Have the almond front and center - an almond illustration or picture right up front. Something that when i see the packaging, I already taste almond in my mouth before reading anything.  Mentioned color above. Typeface, i think it should be serif-ed type face, something not too far of a departure away from current blue diamond, and also not too playful (like noosa or the 'smooth and creamy' font under stonyfield). Imagery and symbols-  again keep it super simple. an almond. Not cheesy / cartoony illustration like Yoplait or activia. something that evokes the almond. I prefer HG and UG the most - however I feel all 3 product descriptions would need work - slimming down, getting really succinct and clear about what makes Blue diamond's non-dairy yogurt different. That top right quadrant is for the few words, clarity, and confidence of what the offering actually is - like kite hill ""artisan almond milk yogurt"". bam.",Smoothie,
198815,Sophie ,Lee,buddhaness@yahoo.com,"1. Yogurt- I think healthy, probiotic benefits, lactose. Brands like Chobani (fun flavor combos), Noosa, St. Benoit (their milk quality), Coco Rico (healthy ingredients) come to mind.  2. I love yogurt as a healthy light snack, for its probiotic benefits, a “healthy” dessert. Not so great- how much sugar and quality of ingredients in most yogurts. Concerned about hormones in the dairy used and whether it’s grass-fed milk... etc.  3. I try to generally stay away from dairy products because it’s harder for me to digest. But a huge concern I have if it’s non-dairy is the texture... whether it’s still creamy and the consistency is key.  4. First think I look for is a non-dairy alternative, then amount of sugar and what kind of sugar, quality of ingredients, then texture, flavor combo, price.  5. Quality of ingredients and amazing taste I love the beautiful packaging and the aesthetics of the brand. The organic & interesting ingredients like sea buckthorn, elderberry speak to me. Haven’t purchased yet because it’s made with milk and I try to be dairy-free. The design appeals to design conscious, female consumers. I also like how the design makes all the key points easy to read/at a glance: Organic, calories. I would love to see a yogurt with collagen in it for beautifying effects!! :clap_tone1: Where Blue Diamond can incorporate innovative ingredients that have healthy benefits beyond probiotics. 
  I love Coco Rico for the quality of ingredients and that it’s sweetened with not sugar but honey. I’ve been intentionally cutting down sugar consumption so anytime I see something is sweetened with fruit juice or honey, monkfruit or any low glycemic sugar, I’ll buy it. I’ve bought this but not as often as I’d like because it’s expensive $22. I like the simple clean branding but wish the label had emphasized “sweetened with” honey and overall more cohesive refined look.  
 Haven’t tried Redwood Hill farm but don’t love the look/aesthetics with too many colors. Cheapens the overall feel of the brand. First if I love the idea of an almond based yogurt that is dairy free. I think it would be awesome to incorporate interesting superfoods in the ingredients, such as matcha, sea buckthorn, CoQ10, collagen... etc. I think yogurt + beauty is an understandable link. If it’s a beautifying yogurt I would be very intrigued. Also very important is to be sweetened with healthy sugars and not cane sugar or high fructose syrup.  2. Functional beauty yogurt line :) 3. I’ve been really into Kalumi Beauty Food collagen bars. They are tasty, well designed and I appreciate their authentic voice. Also I love the look/feel/voice of Moon Juice.  4. Feminine beautiful names 5. Minimalistic design, with beautiful aesthetic and clean graphics Deliciously Healthy 1. Full of vitality... that’s a big promise.  2. Strong because I get a sense of what I’m going to get in a relatable way. I hear the benefits, and it’s value. I can picture myself consuming it in my life.  3. Best tasting. Best by who’s standards? I don’t care about the word best... I like words that describe the experience.  4. How does it give me vitality? How does it make me feel great throughout the day? Thru energy, easily digestible fuel for the body? 1. Best by what parameters? Says who? Hearing blue diamond almonds and CA growers may not be significant to most consumers. What does that mean or what’s so special? I’m not sure if “plant-based” is a resonant term for a lot of people. 
 2. Describing the yogurt itself... smooth, creamy, dairy-free. 
 3. “A smooth tasting non-dairy yogurt packed with nutritional goodness.” More descriptive and less subjective terms. And why does it have to be the best/smoothest... such competitive or boastful language. If the product is that good, let the quality speak for itself. Consumers will be the judge.  4. See above 5. Feels very traditionally sales pitch-y. I’d love to see more authentic, honest communication. Simply why is it special or a smart choice?... etc. 1. Annoying. Mostest, greatest... turn-off language.  2. Describing the texture. Helps me imagine what it would taste like.  3. In 2 sentences, non-dairy, delicious, healthy are all redundant terms. You’re telling me the same descriptors. Makes me feel like you think I’m dumb.  4. How and why is it healthy?  5. Tell me how this is special/different/valuable? 1. Pudding, custard  2. I understand it but it reads very long. Feels cumbersome.  3. Vegan fermented almond milk. 1. contemporary playful because those are positions I respond to and I feel it’s a more relatable fun tone to engage w consumers. 
 2. Communicate in a relatable honest tone like a fun healthy friend. Minimal aesthetic/ packaging 
 3.  3. Yes I think so. I think thoughtful minimalism is very appealing and widely applicable",Smoothie,INFJ
225791,Bill,Sharfman,sharfman@umich.edu,"This is the yogurt I spoke of in the ""starter"" question, ""what's your favorite etc.,"" the one I have been using the most of.  That's  a quart size of LaYogurt lowfat plain, unsweetened yogurt.  I'm putting the three pictures up front because it organizes discussion of yogurts and what is and isn't choosable or possible or considerable.  Front, top, and back views tell you the answers to pretty much all the questions you have when you confront an array of yogurts or choose one, in this varied category.  You see my choice graphically above.  It's a large container of lowfat plain yogurt, contains active (and identified) live cultures that turn (someone's) milk into yogurt and give it probiotic value, it sells for $2.99 a quart, which is a good deal, and the sugars you are getting are all of the lactose variety, so no C12H22O11 or high fructose corn syrup or any of that stuff (which is anathema to me).  The other things are things I want, and at a reasonable (not unnecessarily high) cost or price.  This is exactly what I would look at in connection with any  (or every) yogurt product I picked up to consider.  Example:  If I wanted the smaller sizes to have single portion cups of yogurt to have for single uses, and sometimes I do.  What I said above would apply in such a case, equally.  I'm not going to buy any individual sizes that give you that fruit splodge at the bottom, if it means high simple sugar/carb content.  I don't really care about how much fat there is, but I don't want the simple sugars, just to get the desserty or fruit flavors that are so prevalent with those characteristics (and one can add real fruit to plain yogurt).  In other words, a cup of Dannon or Yoplait that's low fat but a lot of sugar I wouldn't buy.  So in a way, you can tell the entire story off of these three pictures (or views) of any yogurt product -- and conclude yes or no.  (At least if you're me).  I settled on this brand not because I tried all that many others, but by reading the labels, wanting a plain yogurt to use the way I use it, finding it perfectly good tasting and textured, and with a good price for a quart of it.  No need to go afield for more expensive brands just because it keeps Jamie Lee Curtis regular or has a catchy musical signature.  All of this applies equally to kefir (which I think is OK, but have really only used when I needed a lot of good nutrition and at least some gustatory interest in terms of a liquid diet, e.g. before or after a medical procedure.  Same criteria relate to Greek or ""Greek style"" yogurt, which is interesting stuff, but for me, not worth the price premium, I'm aware of it, multiple well known and lesser known brands, have eaten it, might occasionally use it, but mostly not.  Doesn't add to what I'm looking for enough in relation to added cost.  Related but unrelated:  I use a lot of sour cream, and I sometimes use buttermilk for cold soups in the summer (both cultured products).  Call all of this (above) the basics, background to really any question on yogurt there might be. Regarding one of your questions, above, and referencing what I answered in response to Neil's question ""what is your favorite?"" I respond in such a positive way to my favorite yogurt-based breakfast owing to taste, texture, and mouth feel, in a satisfied, satisfying, unitary way.  And it's scandalously healthy, or, as folks say, it's good for you.
 Regarding another question you ask, to summarize, what I like is that it’s a very healthy, convenient, flexible food, probiotic, lots of calcium and protein.  What I don’t like is when the maker puts in fruit goop either mixed through or in a splodge on the bottom, when it's a lot of simple sugar carbs, not what I want to eat.  It's great to add real fruit (and nuts and coconut and so on). 
  Note:  This is all largely ignoring a couple of real considerations in MY mind, because it's not practical to spend a lot of time on them in this  context, and it's uncertain how much value they'd have for those using this commentary for a marketing and branding assignment, nevertheless:  One consideration is it would be hard to find a more significant factor in climate conservation/degradation considerations than heavy uses of beef and dairy products.  Two is that it's getting increasingly harder and harder to interpret or more likely entirely trust labeling and labeling transparency these days, especially among the really big global, industrial scale brands, e.g. GMO information, and the like.  (If anyone wants to get into this discussion with me, just say so).  I'll come back to this, however, especially as relates to consideration one, when it comes to almonds in a bit.  Here is a current story that might be helpful as regards labeling:

 Topic One -- Paradox I come at this assignment (basing my comments on the questions above and the introductory remarks about the overall project in the original summary brief) acutely aware of a paradox, which might have relevance in a literal way or a perceptual way among consumers more broadly.  Here is the paradox:  Yogurt is a dairy product.  Non-dairy yogurt is a contradiction in terms.  That was my ""wait a minute"" moment at the door to this assignment.  Perceptually, I think it's something that has to be dealt with in the branding and differentiating process, somehow, or even a lot of ways.  I've even  made my own yogurt, you need milk, real milk, bulgarian culture, and steady low heat. Because I entertain self-doubt in any such assignment, I went to Wikipedia, not the greatest authority in the world, but a demotic one, which is what I wanted, to find out, OK, is it me, or what IS yogurt (how is it defined).  Here you go (sorry it's so long):
 
 Yogurt , yoghurt , or yoghourt ( /ˈjoʊɡərt/ or /ˈjɒɡət/ ; from Turkish :  yoğurt ; other spellings listed below ) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk . [1]  The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as ""yogurt cultures"". Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid , which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. [1]  Cow 's milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo , goats , ewes , mares , camels , and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. Milk used may be homogenized or not (milk distributed in many parts of the world is homogenized ); both types may be used, with substantially different results.
  
 Yogurt is produced using a culture of  Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  and  Streptococcus thermophilus  bacteria. In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 × 10 6 CFU per milliliter. [2] 
  
 To produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °C (113 °F). [3]  The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a temperature of 45 °C (113 °F) is maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation. [4] 
   Okay, I'm right, yogurt is made from ( some animal's) milk .  So in that sense, it is reasonable to regard it and think of it as a dairy product.  Non-dairy isn't yogurt.  I know, that's being literal.  People are, mostly, and non dairy yogurt does set up a cognitive dissonance (okay, I have a friend who says he knows the soy is an animal, because it gives milk, and burgers, and so on).  I know about those milk pretenders, but I regard them as ""something else,"" milk is a metaphor, they're not the real thing, it's a trick, a gimmick.  I haven't ever tried almond milk, and I bet a lot of other people, even if they've seen the TV commercials, haven't either and haven't been triggered to.  I know in our group some lactose intolerance is represented, and there's a likely interested party.  My curiosity isn't especially aroused to try it, there is nothing wrong with the milk I buy (except what I cited above),  So that's how I think about ""non-dairy yogurt.""  I don't.
 Topic Two -- Here, have some almond yogurt
 After the cognitive dissonance profiled above is swept aside, if it is, trying something out, out of curiosity, may overcome that at least once, I'm back to almonds, which I use and like a lot, e.g. in my ""favorite"" yogurt breakfast, remember? slivered almonds go in there.  I even think of the Blue Diamond smokehouse salted almonds, which are a yummy, high quality snack food (taste, what it actually is).  I think of using almonds for cooking, etc.  So, net net, Is it a whole other thing, just happens to be called ""almond yogurt,"" or is it a substitute for real, milk or dairy based yogurt?  You hand it to me, I'd try it, just to see what it tastes like, if you really taste almonds or if they disappear into something by virtue of some process, a trick of transformation, so on.  Then I'd turn the container around and see what its actual contents really are, is it cultured, or probiotic, how it got this way, is it a treat with some ""caloric cost"" you accept, like chocolate, or is it stuff I'm not sure I want to ingest;  then I'd ask what it costs, if it's something special or ""in the pack"" in terms of price point.  Does it answer some unfulfilled need I have, or is it enough of a treat that I want more of it, or the same it at another or other times?  Remember, a workaround for lactose is not one of my interests or needs.  So what is the reason for it?  Who sent for it?  Or is it a case of ""gee, we got all these almonds here, more almonds than we can sell, let's create even more products that use almonds? So if you're pushing almonds, here is the consideration I hinted at above that I am acutely aware of.  Almonds, like beef and dairy cows, aren't so great for the environment.  Almonds use an extraordinarily high volume of water to grow.  In California, where Blue Diamond's cooperative is, water is really a scarce strategic resource.  There has as a result been fairly widespread use of fracking wastewater for irrigating purposes.  Just knowing this is about as enticing as snakes on a plane.  Are we pushing almonds and stressing water use?  I doubt if I'm the only person who might think of this....
 If it's a whole 'nother thing, you just decided to call it yogurt, then what is it, and how do you position it for someone to let their eyebrows settle down from fully raised.  If it turns out to be a treat that is different from what one already knows or associates about regular or ordinary (dairy) yogurt, then you might both use it and pay a price premium.  If it's yogurt but not yogurt but yogurt all the same, then why would you either want to use it or even necessarily encourage producing it? I don't know enough of the answer to these issues to speculate much less recommend on positioning, but I remain fascinated in a word-play sense by the possible play of ""nut"" and ""not,"" in much the way that ""the unCola"" was a marketing masterstroke years ago.  That's for another day and someone else, but I think you get it. As mentioned before I got the invitation, at this point I'm in no position to go anywhere, I just had surgery on my ankle and my kitchen is a slight expedition already.  I gave you what I think are really critical pictures for understanding in really basic and simple terms the criteria for how I at least think about what I'm looking at and for in a dairy yogurt.  The one I'm using satisfies my needs as described perfectly well, at a nice price, so in fact, I am not sure I could tell you the answer to brands I like and ones I don't, except from the vantage point that why would I pay more to get what I'm already getting in ""my"" current brand,  I have nothing to gain (as I see it) by buying a bunch of other brands I'm perfectly familiar with, as names.  In fact, what's interesting is that the front of the label may or may not be the nicest label design in history, but it very literally says right on the label in simple, direct, and rather literal terms:  We've got what you're looking for (me, that is, I don't know about you). Lowfat (although I'm happy with more fat) Probiotic Unsweetened, plain Plus a nice Holstein that says dairy full quart I've spoken at length in Part One about the considerations that need to be translated graphically or aspects needing to get graphic representation.  If I knew more about the product and how it works out the paradox I elaborated, I might be able to say better what to portray or dramatize, and what not.  But that's what good graphics people do.  You've got whole paragraphs of what would be the contents of MY brief to graphics people:  What to say, what would confuse or cause conflict, how to think about resolving apparent conflict, and how to convey the feelings and semiotics of what the product is for and how it's either the same thing (just like), a different thing, unique, or the answer to a question you hadn't thought of yet. Some of your questions wouldn't occur to me at the yogurt and kefir etc case, until this morning, there were two such containers in my fridge, now there's one because I finished off the other one. When you ask this battery of questions, I just go back to what I wrote in Part One, what are we trying to get across?  Yogurt is dairy.  Almonds is not yogurt.  There's your labeling problem, because there's your positioning problem. I promise I'll try it.  One, to see what the hell i is.  Two to resolve the paradox.  Three to see what the product attributes are.  Four, to see it is just like yogurt (well, sort of), or it's something else that you've turned into ""yogurt"" in a metaphoric way.  That's trial.  I want to know why (satisfy myself, partly through actual trial) that there is a reason to pay a price premium, which you've hinted there is.   I told you earlier that I was fascinated as a word thing with ""nut"" and ""not,"" either those actual words, or that idea, bore straight into the paradox and come out the other side triumphantly special -- differentiated by virtue of benefits not available elsewhere that you've somehow conveyed that you have on offer here.  Make a picture of that, or say it, as in ""unCola.""   You'd better be cheeky, fun, and not at all take yourself too seriously.  This is not the time for earnestly trying too hard to be worthy.  Almonds are fun.  Make this real and the real thing, but fun and not serious.  Be, don't tell.  Let good creatives read this whole thing, this plus the actual info on what the hell it actually is, they should have no trouble creating a brand personality that also says the impossible, yogurt but not.  Maybe you need an un-cow.  You can't be ponderous doing that, and it's got to be gotten across in a blink, in a flash. Deliciously Healthy This is the vitality one.  It's the vim and vigor sounding one, not entirely credible, really.  Otherwise, why would we crave snacks and so on.  But it does say what I believe you have to say about a vegetable based yogurt, it is a good source of the calcium you want sources of.  I suppose this is where the ""probiotic"" benefits of a cultured yogurt style product would go, but you haven't put them in anywhere.  It IS a cultured product, and that's part of the health claims it could and should be making, because it's then giving nothing away to dairy yogurt, where it's a given to most consumers.  ""All you need to feel great and ready to go throughout the day"" is a mildly absurd claim.  It can't hurt, though. Well, as happened the last time, I think I mostly covered that in Q 1, and for all three.  Uncompromised goodness is a claim without characteristics, meaning there is no permission to believe.  I guess you are saying that that claim is paid off by ""only Blue Diamond almonds,"" and ""our California growers,"" but it's still a claim.  ""Smooth and deliciously creamy"" is OK, but what yogurt wouldn't be, A., and B., therefore, you have to have and be this, but it doesn't distinguish.  It's kind of ""filler"" language, words you have to have in the contract, so to say.  ""Plant-based"" I have commented on, it's vital information, and it does distinguish, especially if you can be THE choice if you want ""plant-based.""   But I think the term clangs like a gong.  Are there any other terms that don't leave the food realm but do convey the distinction?  Almond milk is fine, because that's what makes it possible. This is the one where you are on your way to a ""healthy"" positioning.  Tell me, are dairy based yogurts not healthy?  (Well, to a lactose-intolerant person who wishes they could eat yogurt, sure, it's make or break.   But I have no idea if that is a big enough segment to run with and be satisfied with, nor the rest of the segmentation as regards those who join the lactose-intolerant consumers as regarding non-dairy as more healthy). ""Luxuriously creamy"" comes under comments made about word that have to go into the contract so they're OK, but they don't likely distinguish or differentiate. Anytime of day I commented on, go to town with this product, breakfast, snack, pick-me-up, dessert after dinner, whatever.  That's positive. Cultured dairy free almond milk is a good suggestion.  I like it.  But you can see from all my discussion to this point that it is a very logical outcome in the context we confront.  It's also permissible and credible.  It also tacitly says ""the un-yogurt.""  Remember I suggested that in part one of this exercise?  I like the idea of un-yogurt, because it is and it isn't, and it sets it apart.  Pretty nutty yogurt, eh?  Recall how successful 7UP was with ""the uncola.""  However, now that we're here, dairy milk >>>> (dairy) yogurt, so it's reasonable that almond milk >>>> almond yogurt. (Has anyone said anything about the legality of anything called ""yogurt"" being required to be by definition a dairy based product, or is it legal to apply ""yogurt"" to anything yogurt-like or similarly derived some other way or from another source?) I've used this type of positioning graphic tool a lot, since the 1980s.  You can either use it to map where the competitive entries sit, in terms of a map of the market's offerings and significant attributes or character or traits; or posit that you want to have your offering in the upper right hand corner once you get the parameters at the ends of the arrows ""right."" This particular diagram worries me, because I can't see why those brands are where they are (except perhaps for two slightly unconventional packagings being pushed to the upper left).  That means either the brands don't suit the nomenclature, or nomenclature still not quite right, or the nomenclature is OK but misplaced, or, as is demonstrably true, a hybrid of packaging shape and design and label contents are two different things being evaluated as though they were one thing, with the result that we're trying to map two different things at once. 
 Example, Siggi's here is contemporary and serious, which may or may not be two compatible dimensions, but prominent on the Siggi's container is the most old fashioned milk can anyone has ever seen, from a 19th century farm.  Not contemporary.  I'm worried we may not yet have our terms right, hence the grid or map is not yet workable for our purposes. 
 What if we did brand personality. 
 I think Breeze non-dairy almond milk yogurt needs to be TODAY's product, that means contemporary, but it needs to be solidly dignified, the gilt-edged real thing, a sincere blue color scheme that says this product is fun to use for sure, but it performs a valuable service in the community.  Personality-wise, it's like an Obama, a hip guy in a tailored sincere blue suit, who at a glance says all at once, groovy, smart, and the real thing.  You may have to play around with the terms at the ends of the arrows.  ""Smart,"" for a possible example.  Maybe ""different,"" who knows. 
 Now, with that in mind, all the information we need to convey can be gotten across a word at a time, e.g. ""cultured,"" ""non-dairy,"" vegetable product, ""probiotic,"" ""high calcium,"" sort it out.  I suggest harking back to the product picture I displayed in part one, which got it all across right on the label without being a pain in the ass.   (This is not a top tier piece of graphics, but it sure does convey stuff WE need to get across quickly). 
 
 
 
 I am perfectly happy if the container makes good use of our current equity, to endorse cultured almond milk yogurt (or whatever the final nomenclature is that's adopted, for communications clarity and legal reasons.  If it were me, I'd try a compatible darker blue for this and everything else to sit upon (a more sincere blue, let this be the playful part).",Smoothie,
225789,Audrey,Chicago,audrey9899@gmail.com,"When I think of the yogurt category I think of many different options like regular, organic, greet, fat free, low fat, soy, almond, coconut, vegan, gluten free, cows milk, goat milk, sheep milk.  I think of kids varieties as well as adult/regular varieties.  I think the key players are the brand names like Yoplait, Dannon, Chobani, Noosa, So, Stoneyfield, Wallaby, Siggis, Organic Valley, Lifeway, Fage, Brown Cow, to name a few.  The brands represent longevity and alternatives.  While I do think about all these option I also think they are all portable and good for on the go. I just love all of the options yogurt has to offer - with the options I never tire of eating yogurt.  It is great that it is portable, but at the same time sometimes I'd like a larger tub and not all brands off that option - a lot of brands just have single serve.   I think having non diary option is wonderful...dairy isn't always easy on my stomach (and a lot of people I know have the same issue) so I love being able to get the alternatives to dairy - finally!!! I usually consider the flavor/taste (to me they are one in the same), what they are made from..so non diary is always a good option for me.  Those are the two factors I'm all about! Which leads me to the last part of the question - the taste and flavor as well as what it is made from all justify me paying a premium for a good yogurt that I feel will be good for me / my body and taste great.  I have no problem paying a premium for any type of food if I really enjoy it / or if it is a ""good for you"" food. Forager is one I really love because it is a great alternative, and it has made it into my fridge.  I think it is trying to say that it creamy, healthy and tastes great.  Blue Diamond should emulate its alternative style, low sugar, organic qualities. I like the simple clean design so I can quickly read all of the great qualities it has. 
 
 Almond Dream is another one I love because it is made from almonds, non GMO, non dairy, gluten free and comes in good flavors, yes it has made it into fridge!!  I think it is saying try me I'm a dream, healthy and you cant go wrong.  Blue Diamond should emulate the non GMO, non dairy, gluten free and it will be quite easy but they should also offer some more unique flavors.  I like seeing the brand and the great features it offers.  It would be nice if it came in larger sizes too so tell Blue Diamond to make different size options.
 
 
 Liberte is a yogurt I've had and I really like the full flavor and unique flavor they offer.  It has made it into my fridge because of the flavors they offer!  The brand is trying to say its pure goodness. Blue Diamond should emulate the organic, gluten free, unique flavors but again offer larger size containers for those of us that like to keep a larger supply in the fridge.  I like the clean look of the container, but I had to hunt to find the benefits of this product so it is better to put them on the front of the package. 
 
 
 
 Icelandic is another one that has made it into my fridge because of the good flavors, free of gluten, artificial flavors, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and GMO ingredients.  I think they are trying to say that they are clean, healthy and fresh.  Blue Diamond should also have good flavors, free of gluten, artificial flavors, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and GMO ingredients. and even better yet they will be diary free and make it into my fridge regularly.  I like the clean design but I wish the container showed more of the good qualities of the product and came in a larger is tub too.
 
 Maple Hill Creamery is a yogurt I noticed on the shelf during this exercise that has not yet made it into my fridge.  I like the fact that is says grass fed cows, no sugar added, and tastefully tart.  It says that the milk it is made with is organic, but is the entire product ?!?!  It should be more clear. I like the cleanness of the container so I can read quickly the good qualities, and I love that it comes in a large size tub too.  Blue Diamond should also have no sugar added.   
 Now for the two that I do not really care for... The boring Yoplait original...I hate that the container has not changed in 20 years and I find that the flavors in their brands are not really substantial - I can hardly taste the flavor it has.  They are also high in fat and sugar.  It made it into my fridge many years ago, but not for a long time. I think the brand is trying to say that they are a pioneer in the yogurt business and have been around a long time.  I don't think Blue Diamond should emulate anything except to become a pioneer as well . Yo Crunch is a variety that I would never purchase.  It is too sweet and sugary and caloric!  It has not made it into my fridge for that reason.  I think they are trying to say that they are a sweet treat.  Blue Diamond should do the opposite and say that they are a healthy treat.  The container is way too busy and all I see is candy, but I want to see the beneficial aspects of the product. Blue Diamond should offer a container that has their recognizable logo but not be too cluttered so that the great parts of the product stand out...like the fact it is made from almonds and non dairy.  If it also said unsweetened, no sugar added, non GMO and if it came in a greek style that would be ultra unique,   The personality / tone should be that of a newbie in the market, and it should be fun, clean and upbeat similar to some of the 5 products I pictured in the last question.  I think the name can be like others - non dairy yogurt and if they offer great unique flavors their brand will stand out.  I would like to see the packages in different sizes because it is nice to have a family size in the fridge and some portable sizes as well. Healthy Vitality This one is awesome, it actually does not leave me wondering about much at all.  It is kind of a stretch but the only thing missing is the California hand picked almond aspect which is not even a big deal, I think I'd assume that from the brand of the product.  The strength of this one is it mentions all of the positive points for me, so the non dairy, full of vitality, plant based, almond yogurt, calcium!!!  Again similar to the first point of this question there is not much as a weakness at all and it does not leave me with any questions, it covers 99% of what I need to know and it would be a nice perk if it mentions california hand picked almonds but not a deal breaker at all !  It might be wasteful to mention how I will feel twice at the beginning and end and maybe combine that together.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to include information about a variety of unique flavors instead of mentioning how I will feel twice...feel full of vitality and feel great and ready to go throughout the day. It makes me think about the fact that it could be a good source of calcium, and makes me wonder what flavors they will offer.  The strength of this statement is the mentioning of non dairy, the brand name blue diamond, the source being california, and plant based because these are all important things for those of us that do not purchase dairy yogurt.  I think the weakness is that I miss the word luxurious when referring to the product because i want to feel like I'm spoiling myself.  I'd also like to hear the fact that it is a good source of calcium because that will make me want to eat it more often.  It also isn't telling me about the feeling of vitality or fullness that I will experience and knowing it is a substantial snack or even meal replacement from that wording.  I'd like to know the flavor options and the benefits of the product like the calcium content.  So I'd add some things like the word luxurious, that it is a good source of calcium, and one of the facts that i will feel vitality or full to complete the description. 1.  From this statement I think it will taste great and be a real treat like experience, and hopefully energize me to get through the rest of my day.  
 2.  I think the strength in the message is that it is non dairy and made from almond milk because there are so many people like me that try to avoid dairy products.  
 3.  I think the weakness is that it is not telling me that it will come in a variety of flavors, that it is not mentioning the fact that it has calcium, or that the almonds are from California, or full of vitality and most importantly plant based!  It would be nice if some of these words were incorporated too. 4.  The questions it leaves me with are the nutritional info like is it for sure plant based, what flavors does it come in, is it a good source of calcium? 5.  I think if some of the points I mentioned in question 3 above were incorporated I would know more about it and remember it when I'm at the store shelf that I need to give it a go. I've seen this type of product called yogurt, yogurt alternative, non diary yogurt.  I think any of them are acceptable and the consumer will know what it is from the name, brand, description.  If it was called diary free cultured almond milk I would think it was milk not yogurt alternative - unless it said diary free made from cultured almond milk.  The alternatives would be diary free yogurt made from cultured almond milk, or diary free cultured almond milk style yogurt, but I feel like these names are getting too long, and when you see the brand on the label whether or not the word yogurt is on the package I will know what it is from the brand and from the section the product is in, within the store. I would like to see blue diamond get away from the boring traditional and move into the contemporary with a little bit of the playful and a touch of the serious is fine too.  It seems like the hip and trendy brands are in these quadrants and they are visually appealing.  I feel like if i see blue diamond in those quadrants I would definitely notice the blue diamond and gravitate towards it because it is plant based and i know the brand in general.  I think they should somehow model it after the Siggi's or the Noosa, their labels are unique, modern and even the shape of the noosa container is unique and attractive to me.  I believe the images I've chosen work for any of the 3 positions.  I'm thinking of of a different unique, stand out type of packaging that is good for on the go too.",Smoothie,

I am not a vegetarian, so until recently I've never given it much thought (other than non-dairy milk) but now that it's becoming more prominent I think brands and chefs etc. are creating more and more plant-based foods that actually taste delicious. For me flavor is everything, so I don't want anything to taste too ""healthy"" for lack of a better word. I want to be dazzled. I have been truly impressed by some plant-based alternatives lately. I recently ate a chicken alfredo dish and had NO idea the noodles were made of veggies. I was stunned.My food and nutrition mind map follows some sort of morning to night routine. It all begins with my cup of coffee. Lately it's been iced coffee (because it's still 90 degrees in Nashville) and I've been using Oatly oat milk thanks to certain people you may know! 1) The thing I enjoy the most is...
a. I most enjoy prepping and cooking food with my boyfriend. (Check out our homemade pickles attached below.)
b. These moments give me excitement, bonding, and pride in what we make. Even the smallest dish or creation is that much more enjoyable because we made it together.
c. We're actually pretty impulsive when it comes to our cooking. We analyze what's in our kitchen and creatively come up with recipes. 
d. Joyous. Active. Proud.

2) The thing I find the most effective is...
a. The most effective would have to be coffee, which I feel like a lot of people will say.
b. Coffee is my starter kit. It's a morning ritual I can barely live without. As much as I'd like to switch to Green Tea, I prefer the taste and texture of coffee. 
c. Every morning I have coffee with oat or almond milk before breakfast.
d. Excited. Energized. Rejuvenated.

3) Something that is part of a routine/ritual is...
a. So much of it! Morning coffee and nighttime tea are definitely part of my routine. 
b. I drink coffee to perk me up and get me excited for the day's activities. I drink tea to help me digest and relax.
c. Every morning I have coffee with oat or almond milk before breakfast. At night after dinner I have a lemon ginger tea mixed with sleepy-time.
d. Coffee: Excited. Energized. Rejuvenated. Tea: Soothed. Serene. Calm.

4) Something I use for an emergency boost is...
a. My emergency boost is a green juice from my local juicer. 
b. I order the ""Well Being"" which is kale, spinach, apple, cucumber, ginger and lemon. This boost of nutrition instantly brings me back to life.
c. If I'm feeling depleted midday, I'll swing by my local juicer for this green juice.
d. Healthy. Happy. Full.

5) Something that is a recent addition to my life is...
a. Sadly the newest addition is multivitamins. If always been a little weird about taking any form of pills or supplements, but as I age I realize the importance. Photo attached!
b. I take this multivitamins because they're loaded with vitamins A, C, D, E, Bs, Biotin and Folic Acid. I try to take them every day, and on days that I eat less healthy foods I feel good knowing I'm not lacking my vitamins.
c. I try to take 1-2 a day generally midday or evening.
d. Satisfied. Regimented. Nourished.Soon after I finish my coffee I whip up breakfast. My most typical meal is an egg and cheese with avocado and sriracha on toast or a bagel. The coffee and breakfast are crucial to kickstart my body and mind. Through the day I try to snack on something healthy. Maybe I have some grapes or strawberries, or a veggie platter. If I have nothing good at the house I may pick up a green juice at my local juicer. At some point during the day or night I will add either lemon or apple cider vinegar to my water. Not only do I like the flavor, but the health benefits of both appeal to me. A healthy lunch for me is usually a sandwich or salad. I also try to take a multivitamin daily, because there are unfortunately days where I don't eat as healthy and the vitamins make me feel better about myself. Lastly is dinner and tea. A healthy dinner for me is some sort of lean meat and maybe a salad. (An unhealthy dinner for me is pizza or pasta, which admittedly does happen a lot.) I always wrap the night with a lemon ginger and sleepy-time tea to help me digest and relax my body and mind. All these elements make for a pretty energetic day. These are the days I only eat dairy and carbs, which sadly happens every now and again because I love bread and cheese haha! If I've slept over 8 hours and had a balanced diet the day before I am far more likely to feel energized the next day. Feeling energized can also heavily rely on what I'm doing that day. If I'm excited for a work project, meeting, photoshoot, event etc. I am much more likely to feel energized. I can muster up energy based on excitement.

My biggest challenges achieving this energy is due to all my vices. My love for a couple wines or whiskey after dinner and my love for bread and cheese. The other challenge is if I don't have anything exciting going on with work or my social life that day.",Shine 2.0,

Why you use it / what does it give you? I use it because I like the taste and the energy boost it gives. It’s the perfect healthy snack.
Why do you love it so much? It tastes really good, it is simple and pure, and it’s a lifesaver when you are feeling peckish and low on energy.
Ever thought: if only could I change this one thing and it would be perfect?  The oil that separates from the almond butter is a bit annoying. It’s also like the consistency at the bottom of the jar is always dryer and not as creamy/oily as the top. 
What form/format it is in? Would a different format be better for your lifestyle? It comes in small jars which I think work well but maybe cause the separation of the oil more.
What new protein products have caught your interest recently and why you’re interested in them? I have been excited by cashew yogurts and would be so into trying almond yogurts. How and when do you use it? As an on the go snack or something to eat while you are busy and doing other things.
What is compelling about this product? It is an easy and very portable snack - something to keep on your bag “just in case” that will help out in a variety of situations.
I expected the bars I bought to taste better but they were really nasty. They tasted too artificial and the texture was off. They also had awful after tastes so it just left me with a bad impression.
I liked the size of the bars and that they were actually very natural and didn’t have that many ingredients. They did the job but the taste was really not worth it. The taste is a major issue that would need to be improved. My first idea is almond yogurt - I have tried cashew yogurts before and really liked those but have never seen an almond yogurt. A vegan yogurt option made of almonds sounds really tasty to me! My second idea is like a Panko bread crumb packet situation but with almonds. They would be toasted and then ground up in very even and easy to use tiny sizes. These would make the perfect crust on fish or tofu and could even be added to baked goods for extra protein. 1. Almond water! It is light and refreshing but full of protein and very hydrating. And it tastes great!
2. It makes me feel refreshed and invigorated. It is fresh and tasty! It also has a light cinnamon flavor which goes well with almond so it tastes really nice.",Shine 2.0,ESFP

Soups come a dime a dozen in the canned food aisle. There is no shortage of variety, and Butternut Squash is a popular flavor among the flock. Many brands carry a Butternut Squash soup recipe consisting of a chicken broth base with pureed squash and a host of flavoring agents, and some include other vegetables such as sweet potatoes. This product is unique in that it features almond protein blended in with the chicken stock base—raising the protein content from the average of 9g per serving to 30g per serving. While Butternut Squash Almond soup recipes exist on the internet, no such formula is sold commercially by a packaged food producer. The almond extract adds a nutty flavor to the soup and enhances the creamy consistency.  The soup is packaged in a tetra pack with two servings totaling 16 FL OZ (480 mL). Each serving consists of 250 calories.

2. This soup is ideal to be eaten for lunch or dinner as a full or partial meal. The product is intended to be served heated. When eating it you feel invigorated, nourished and indulgent.

- How and when you used it? 
I used the Golden Milk Turmeric powder I trialled initially in the morning because I thought it would be a good substitute for coffee. However, based on the flavor profile, it felt more like a dessert drink so I eventually switched to evening consumption.
- What did you find compelling about this product? 
I liked the combination of turmeric (which is supposed to help with inflammation) and other ""super food"" spices.
-What did you expect from it when you bought it and how it delivered on your expectations? 
I had mixed straight turmeric into plant-based milks before to create turmeric lattes, so I expected something similar, but was pleasantly surprised that the additional ingredients added warmth and complexity that's not present in just turmeric.
- What do you like about it?  
I like that it's a warm non-coffee, non-tea beverage with a flavor profile that's new to me.
- What could be better?
While I understand that the whole point of the turmeric/""Golden Milk"" angle is that the turmeric helps fight inflammation, I do kind of wish it had some protein or something in it (like I wish everything had a little more protein in it.)   1. It's gum! It's tiny but you can chew it and get ten grams of protein!

Protein is the essential building block and maintenance for the body. Helps build bone, muscle, tissues. Maintains metabolism, healthy brain function. I’d say it’s like the gas for cars. It helps keep operations at optimal level.
2. My approach to food and nutrition has always been very general and intuitive. I can’t necessarily explain it well... more like a general feeling... oh I feel a little tired or low energy today. Then I’ll eat eggs or meat. Usually I listen to what my body craves and that keeps me at my optimal. I’ve never learned about calories, counting, portioning. I basically eat what I want, when I want and usually up to being 70% full.
2. Biggest challenge is if I’m getting enough sleep and also if I manage to wake up early enough to meditate. Whenever I do both, I feel energized and high vibrations.1. Morning breakfast made of fermented rice, poached eggs, water or oat milk with osmanthus flower. In Chinese medicine, this is considered a warming dish that also beautifies the skin. I boil water/oat milk, drop 2 organic eggs in it and stir, spoon out 4 heaping spoonfuls of the fermented rice, pour in the boiled eggs/liquid mixture and top off with dried osmanthus flower. I feel beautiful, cared for, satisfied. 
2. Organic celery juice I make first thing in the morning and drink on an empty stomach. It helps give me glowing skin, relieve constipation, and makes me feel healthy getting green juice in. The clustered salt also replenish the body and help with my thyroid hormones. I wash the fresh stalks and juice with my breville juicer. I feel healthy, nourished and vibrant.
3. Drinking ceremonial grade matcha in the afternoon, often around 3pm. It’s a pleasurable experience to take time for tea... also it gives me energy and antioxidants. First I scoop the matcha powder out of its miron glass jar with a bamboo scooper. Thank I sift it thru a fine stainless steel sifter over a ceramic mixing mug. I pour warm water over it and foam up with a electric foamer. Then I finally pour it into my matcha bowl. I feel buzzed, calm and peaceful when I drink it. 
4. Sometimes I will add a small scoop of homemade cbd coconut oil my friend made for me into my matcha. It’s extra relaxing... for when I want to chill out but not drink alcohol. Same process as 3, and adding a scoop of the oil, with oat milk and wild honey. I feel relaxed, creative, open.

I liked the branding, and I also resonated with the company name. Additionally, this company outlined their local farmer partnerships on their packaging, which I was very excited about. 

Additionally, I was intrigued to try this product due to the ""collagen synthesis"" that was also included on the packaging. 

I figured this would be an interesting addition to my daily routine, however I wasn't relying on anything amazing coming from trying out this product. I found that it surprisingly filled me up, easily, and was quite nice to drink (initially).

304827,Luisa,Alberto,luisita@gmail.com,"Protein Bars

I use protein bars when I'm on the go and need to grab something quick and easy to travel with, which is usually when I am taking my daughter to school in the morning or when we go on a road trip for family outing.

I usually eat a bar when I am super hungry and need something nutritious and filling.  It gives me energy and time in between meals.

I love it so much because it doesn't need to be refrigerated, so I can just keep it in my bag as a back up option in case I am super hungry and/or can't make it to a full meal.  It also helps me make better decisions about what I eat during my meals, since I am not starving and desperate.

I don't believe any changes would make it perfect - unless, perhaps if the packaging were biodegradable.  I think that would make it the best option.

It is an individual bar, this is the best format for my lifestyle.

Protein products with strictly whole ingredients have caught my attention lately!  I like to eat convenient processed foods that are as close to whole foods as possible. I would keep two of these in my backpack, and use one for the morning and the other in case of an emergency in between meals during the day.

I like the packaging, and the fact that I can get the protein I need and some green supplemented into my diet.

I expected that it would be satisfying and delicious, and easy to transport.  It met all of my expectations - and there are multiple flavors!  This idea just popped into my head because I would want the option to eat one everyday, or multiple times a day - so perhaps it would be better if there were bars specified for the type of nutrition you might need in the morning vs. for a pick me up, etc.!

I would love that I don't have to think about whether or not the snack was replacing the proper nutrients I might need for a breakfast replacement or satisfying and nutritious snack.

The texture could be better, it's a challenge to get simple ingredients to be a soft and substantial texture.   Almond bites!  I have always liked the idea of snacking on almonds throughout the day, but I get bored of the flavor and am never satiated. With almond bites, you get the same experience of a healthy on-the-go daily snack, but they are more tasty and a more satisfying texture.

They make you feel satiated, energized and excited because who does't like to eat things in small ball form?!",Shine 2.0,
327451,Nneka,Anozie,nnekaonyemachi@gmail.com,"To me, feeling energized means being in ""flow""—having enough life force to do what I need to do to be the best that I can be, whether that has to do with my work, choice of exercise, or sense of presence in my personal relationships. Feeling energized makes things like waking up in the morning to get on an 1.5 hour commute easier than it seems it would be. I would tell them the benefits of protein is to build and maintain muscle. Athletes need it for this reason, in excess, it seems.

I don’t feel the need to build muscle, so I don’t go out of my way to include protein in my diet. However, food that I like to eat such as beef, seafood include protein. Plant-based sources that are common in everyday meals such such as chickpeas, lentils, beans, and quinoa have it as well. When it comes to my smoothies, I include kale, chia & hemp seeds in my smoothie, which happen to have a solid amount of protein in it. Though people tend to associate protein with meat, it really is prominent in plant-based sources of protein are important to me, not because I prioritize protein, but because of the other benefits they hold, such as their vitamin content, water content, and ability to detoxify the body as a whole. Something that’s a part of a ritual is definitely water. I have to have water in the morning, middle of the day, and night. It’s the first step of both my morning and evening skincare rituals. Water gives me something that nothing else can by literally sourcing every system in my body with the energy it needs to have for the day. If I don’t have any water for the entire day, I’m bound to become irritable in a way that I don’t even notice, which is why it’s so important to different parts of my daily routine—I subconsciously don’t appreciate it as much as I should! It’s easy to take water for granted. I kept losing my recyclable water bottles, so I usually keep a plastic bottle that I’ve bought before to refill. I don’t have any preparations for this one.

Something I use for an emergency boost is Matcha green tea. If I’m ever really exhausted, I know I can run to a local coffee shop to get it. It gives me a feeling of calm alertness and focus that herbs and smoothies just don’t. I’ve read up about it, and it has a special amino acid called L-theanine that works wonders on reducing stress. I use it on an emergency basis, but I really should have it more than once a day, every day. It’s that good for the body. I don’t have a preparation ritual, though, because when I’ve tried to make it myself, I didn’t do it properly. I haven’t made time to learn how to properly prepare it. I just get it from the local coffee shop. Luckily, it’s a popular, effective drink. Three words that describe me when I have this is grounded, “in flow,” and calm.

A recent addition to my life is bacopa. It’s an herbal tincture I’m using to help with my memory. It’s known for being really great at increasing it over the long term. I’ve used other herbs like Ginkp Biloba and Gotu Kola, and wanted to experiment with something new. I take it through a shot of juice, or blend it into my smoothie. When I make it with my smoothie, it’s usually early in the morning, and is the most peaceful ritual ever because none of my roommates are awake, and I don’t have to shift myself around to get to the fridge. I make a guess of the new fruits I want to try for the day, and, being a creature of habit end up picking the same ones as I usually do. After adding the fruits and veggies, I’ll put in my boosters—chia, flax & hemp seed, a couple of other herbs, and bacopa. Words that describe me when I have this herb is conscious, present, and confident.In its best cases, it offers a feeling of seamlessness and gracefulness, and joy in me, allowing me to pay attention to my tasks a mindful way. It offers clarity to my mind, makes me less reactive in everyday situations, and helps me make better, faster choices.  Of course, different situations can bring forth different sources of energy. My favorites are the ones that come from smoothies, hot showers, nature, a good day at work, and healthy personal relationships. Feeling energized, however, may also come from smaller things such as an anger-inducing customer service experience, or the anxiety of possibly missing a meeting after your flight home was delayed. These are emotions that some people know how to transform into useful energy. Though they are from a negative source, the result ends in the same feeling—a life force that the receiver has the choice to use into action. In summary, feeling energized means being given the tools I need to have in order to get through my day.

My current biggest challenges in trying to receive this is my race against time, and the ever-needing shift of prioritization levels. Having more than an hour commute when I’m not prepared to can lead to me having a bad day before I even get to my office. Who knows how that has affected my productivity in the past? Maybe, if my commute didn’t take as long, I would be able to sleep in a little more and start my morning in a slower way, if I wanted to.  Time is the one thing humans can’t control, but have to learn to manage. Managing priorities is another large obstacle that gets in the way of feeling energized. One can know how to keep themselves energized but simply not follow the necessary path to do it because it’s just not a priority for them.",Shine 2.0,

This is relevant to me because its something that I make the active choice to do every single day. It's easy to get caught up in the rush and stresses of everyday busy life, but it's so incredibly important to take the time to stop and think about what you're eating, why you're eating it, and where it came from.

Life is so damn hectic in the modern day, and most people don't realize how much work it is to really take care of yourself. You can't just be happy and healthy with the snap of your fingers, you have to work at it daily. Principle 3 focuses on how diet affects your everyday life which I've recently (in the past year or two) been very adamant about. I've realized the bread and cheese that I love so damn much isn't bringing me energy and that I'm lacking the benefits of fruits and veggies. I got a blender for Christmas so I can be more regimented about my intake of vitamins and nutrients. I'm always on Pinterest looking up new smoothie or juice recipes, or healthy slow cooker meals. For the sustained energy principle a brand that really delivers is Saje Natural Wellness. I own their oil diffuser (pictured below) and lots of diffuser oil blends and topical blends. Saje's sole purpose (in my opinion) is to calm and rejuvenate. Their natural products have so many healing powers.

We are what we eat. I definitely feel a difference when I eat whole foods versus processed foods. I base my choice of the food I put into my body on how it makes me feel. I know that nutrition is always better than indulgence. I have learned to make the right choices as it affects my mood so much. The second one I find most relevant is, About me, About us. I am finding myself more and more focussed on paying attention to how much as a family we are contributing to the waste and use of nonessential things in our home. We want to help our children to have lives they can look forward to building for themselves. Finding joy in things, using things that are practical and functional and knowing what things in life are essential is important to us. This is a photo of a bread that I have recently discovered.  It was recommended by a peer. Because I no longer eat flour, I thought that I was going to have a hard time giving up bread. Until I found this! This bread I made from whole sprouted grains. It is a life saver! I am able to still enjoy bread. This brand actually makes more than just slice bread as well, allowing a variety of options which is like a godsend to me. I stand by my food intake on keeping with whole foods only and this brand allows me to get in what I want and what I need. 
 One thing that I  would like to have in my life is the quality of the beef we eat. I want to buy local beef that is grass fed and grass finished. There is no specific branding on this but it is something I plan to try in the future. The access to this quality of meat is not the best, and the when I find it, the prices are hard to digest. This product is a wax based food wrap. I'm sorry but I cannot thing of the brand name for this product but I plan to purchase more with the company etee. I love this product because it allows us to remove the plastic food wraps (you know saran wrap crap!) I feel good about less waste. We purchased this to help reduce the use of plastics.

304828,Kristen,Brotemarkle,kristenbrote@gmail.com,"Principle 3: Food is my foundation. I 100% feel that food is my foundation - the quality of how I eat effects my mood, effects how energized I am, if I have crashes later in the day, can get through a good workout, etc. If i eat crap feel I feel like crap and sometimes feel it the next day. I love eating well consistently because it FEELs better. I love how this has an emphasis on how I FEEL versus principle 2 where it was about feeling my best to be present for my day because it's busy. I prefer the idea of feeling good all the time because that is what we deserve in life, to feel amazing. If food doesn't' make me feel good- that's a problem. 
 Principle 5: 
I'd love to be 100% plant based but since I'm not there yet, I do feel like any clean protein sources that are reliable and natural are huge pluses for me and something I can incorporate in my diet, asap, so I feel a need and want for it. Principle: Feeling good (food as a foundation). 
 1. 
 2. Ashwaganda  - it is an herbal supplement that makes me feel AMAZING. So relaxed. I am also pretty sensitive (to stimulants or other things like that) but in general this has a relaxing benefit that I enjoy, while still being ""natural"". I'm not taking a drug to relax, drinking alcohol, etc. and as an adaptogenic herb it can help your body better process/manage/relieve stress. Healthy for your adrenal and it definitely helps me feel a bit more peaceful. I had to laugh when I got the photo of the product I buy because it literally says ""feel good"" on the label (lol)! Which is the principle I chose. I had gotten it in the past (as a diff brand) and chose this one on Amazon because it seemed to have enough reviews that it would be the same benefits I've gotten in the past from Ashwaganda. I ran out yesterday and had thrown it away so my photo is a screen shot of the one I ordered. I'm definitely reordering it because I did like it a lot.

 
 3. I put the powder in hot water and drink it as tea. Generally I do it in the evening. I use it when I am feeling a little too stressed or restless (maybe because I had too much coffee or want to relax in a more healthy way).
 
 
 
 Some weeks I'll have it ~2 times per week though other times I skip it for a couple weeks. 
 4. A product or brand that doesn't = ice cream! I feel like most ice cream brands are things I avoid, they make me feel bad, generally a sugar high (with a crash) and the dairy makes me break out. So even if there is a brand that has ""healthy ice cream"" for the most part I avoid it because I know that is actually not the case (by trial and error). So it's not just about 1. 
 2. for my other principle, about foods that help me be plant based, I recently purchased a 6 pack of the Banza ""chickpea"" pasta. I've been trying to incorporate more plant based protein into my diet but was having a hard time doing that (just cooking beans with salads wasn't cutting it!), so for me this was a tasty and easy way to make a favorite food item (pasta) a plant-based protein win as well.
3. I use it for cooking - dinners or lunches, sometimes as meal planning to bring to work, but I prefer to cook it right before eating it. :slight_smile: 
 4.  I'm thinking of protein burger (vegan) options that I've considered buying before and haven't yet ... for the most part I am too hesitant to get the stuff that feels overly processed to me or with 20 ingredients.

For me, food allows me to be the power house that I am :smiley: Without the proper nutrients I feel sluggish, tired, not present, and sometimes even in pain. When I eat properly, with intention, and with clean ingredients, I am happier, healthier, able to be present and in the moment, and am sustained in a way that supports my busy lifestyle. Principal 3 - clean products for happy gut health and clean eating! Daily Harvest is a weekly subscription service that delivers 6-24 premade smoothies to my house via UPS. I place them in the freezer and make as needed. All I have to do is add my liquid of choice, blend, and then take on the go with me. Daily Harvest has a variety of different smoothie options, I generally take the ginger+greens, banana + greens, cold brew + almond, and a few of their savory soups for dinner (they're AMAZING). Quick, easy, super fresh/clean, and YUMMY. 
 I make the smoothies in the morning and the soups in the evening -- smoothies are daily 6-7 days/week. Soups are more like 2-3 nights per week. I think there are other meal delivery services that probably provide similar products, I just love the smoothie/soup combo though. Easiest way to eat on the go, get the nutrients I need, feel satiated, and happy! Plus, I love Daily Harvest design. The only thing that bothers me is the amount of trash that is generated from the service. Wish there was a more sustainable option.  Principal 2 - sustainability I'm obsessed with almonds from a stand at the Farmers Market - they're always my go to snack. This farm creates so many different varieties, but right now I like chili lime roasted almonds If I haven't had the time to go to the farmers market, then I opt for roasted almonds from Trader Joes or some type of macadamia / almond / cashew trail mix pack from Whole Foods.

Both companies feel like they go to great lengths to ensure their nutrition is of the highest quality. And it shows in how I feel! This is the kind of consumerism I want to support.

Similarly, if what I'm eating places a disproportionate burden on the environment, to the point where producing food for others is impaired, that's  a problem. Sustainability is really important to me. I am only as valuable as successful as the community that surrounds me. 
 Principle 3--we are spiritual beings that need to be nourished via our mind, body, and soul. There is a direct link between our cognitions influencing our thoughts, which influence our actions. When I feel good about life, I make healthier food choices. When I'm rushed, or stressed, or feeling down--I eat poorly. I don't take care of myself because my mind is so preoccupied. It's a catch 22--if I'm feeling bad, I eat bad, and then I feel bad about eating bad. Beeswax wrap--the company pays a living wage (my friend happens to have landed a job there recently) and the corporate environment is very healthy.

 I would love to buy clothing from ethical clothing companies, but the pricing is so prohibitive.

I did not have a single illness in that 6 months, and actually no one in my house did! It was amazing. So now we all take JuicePlus and have yet to be sick.

JuicePlus is basically dehydrated fruit and vegetable juice in a capsule. Taking it showed me how may nutrients I was missing, even though I still feel like I eat a lot of plants! It illustrated the point that I need to take care of my body, and when I do, my body functions better.

Principle 3 is relevant because it is so so true, and the foundation for everything in life really.  It doesn't get more relevant than what you put into your body - because that decision effects the entire world (yours and others'). This brand does a great job of showing that it cares about its impact on the world (multiple certifications, sourced from famers they know, etc.) and it is also a much healthier alternative to the mass marketed chocolate cereal products that leverage animated characters and bright colors to win over their target audience.

230603,Susan,Schell,susankristinaschell@gmail.com,"I suppose I would like to think that my best friend would describe me as a fun and curious gourmand, an avid traveler, a job juggler, and an empath. Here are my three photos with their respective stories and why I picked them. This is a pretty dorky answer...but Gilmore Girls. I've watched this show since I was 11 years old or so and can rewatch it over and over again. I've rewatched the entire thing multiple times and can dip in and out of random episodes at any time. I love all of their obscure references and quick dialog. I think it is also a nostalgic thing for me because I grew up with it and just find it very comforting and relaxing to watch. Hot lattes or cappuccinos with perfectly foamy oat milk. Or bubble tea - specifically jasmine milk tea with bubbles or mango green tea with bubbles. A dramedy. I think I would like to live in Tokyo for a while but am also currently really enjoying living in France. Green! I am at peak happiness when drinking a nice coffee or bubble tea on vacation. I love being in a new city and discovering a new cute cafe or tea place. I would be a very spicy salsa because I think it is very versatile and really compliments a lot of other things very well. I have loved spicy salsas since I was a toddler and I just feel like no snack tastes as good as salty tortilla chips and a good spicy salsa. I just feel like this is one that is close to me and its a snack I get very excited about! For example, I get so excited and into it that I've been known to fill up on chips and salsa before dinner and then am not able to eat my meal...I just love it and find a good salsa so addictive. It is also great to use while cooking so I just think it is the best! Oatly - I think they are making a solid effort at perfecting non dairy milks and being very transparent and proactive in their mission: ""Our sole purpose as a company is to make it easy for people to turn what they eat and drink into personal moments of healthy joy without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process."" - Oatly.com

They share their sustainability reports and emphasize what steps they take to make the world a better place while still making a great product. I respect their business motto and how it feels genuine, I don't feel like they are green washing themselves or being sneaky in any way. Beyond Meat - perhaps in 2020 this is a bit less daring but I think the idea of making a product that could so clearly replace meat is quite daring. It is also daring to think ahead like they did and to think about the future of a product as well as the world that it will be sold in. I also think it was daring to do such a close product to the thing that it is trying to replace. I actually think Trader Joe's has a lot of Humble Swagger. I know it is more of a grocery chain and than a stand alone brand but they make amazing quality food and snacks that they sell for very reasonable or ""humble"" prices. Trader Joe's is a heavyweight for me in the snack arena, I think they do a huge variety of very flavorful snacks, for very cheap, and are just very unassuming and seem humble about it to me. Morning coffee - I take my time and make a nice french press coffee and foam up some oat milk in my aerochino milk frother. I love this so much that I sometimes get excited about it the night before. I just feel like I can relax and take my time slowly in the morning. 

Snorkeling with my new full face snorkeling mask - I just bought this snorkel mask that covers my whole face so it is so relaxing and easy to breathe through. I am living in the south of France right now and am really trying to maximize my time by the beach. I love floating in the water and breathing calmly while watching lots of different types of fish. It is so serene and peaceful. I do also get very excited when I see a new type of fish or crab that I haven't ever seen before. The other day I stumbled upon a huge school of hundreds of long and skinny silver fish and it felt kind of magical being just above them all and watching them reflect and shine as they swam around. 

Eating pastries in bed while watching a movie - My boyfriend is a dessert freak and we have found an amazing local bakery / high pastry shop here in Antibes. They have a dark cherry pavlova with a pistachio cream that is hands down, the best dessert I think I have every had. It is also just stunningly beautiful to me - pretty pink meringue and light green cream covered in dark cherries. But we have started having dessert in bed while watching a movie and I just love doing this! Again, it is very relaxing but I also think this is super indulgent and fun! It also feels a little bit ""bad"" because it is a big dessert and eating it in bed is a little weird, but it just makes me happy! Makes me want to keep eating factor Yes, there is a difference between hot and spicy. I think in English, the words are used a bit more interchangeably than they should be. To me, spice is more nuanced and can be a variety of flavors - it could be sweet, salty, or whatever and it encompasses many decidedly not hot spices/seasonings. Hot is a sensation, it is a feeling in your mouth and body.

It is a bit more distinguished and the words are used more properly in French. In French ""épicé"" or spiced, means literally seasoned, flavored, or full of spices while ""piquant"" which means more of an itching, burning, stinging sensation that would be more like ""hot"" in English in terms of food. I understand and relate best to this type of distinction between the words and find the way we talk about it in English confusing because both words kind of mean the same thing in colloquial language. All of my snacks are listed down below. The last two pictures are for the same snack but I just don't have access to a lot of my favorite spicy snacks while living in France. I am not sure that this counts as ""nice"" because I really didn't like it that much...but I like this food in general - a salsa I tried here in France. 

This is an American brand of Tex-Mex products so I figured that it might have a Tex-mex level of spice despite being sold here in a French grocery store and designed for the French palate ...but wow it was not spicy at all. So I like salsas a lot, but will never try this one again. It didn't make the cut because it just wasn't what it advertised, to me a medium spicy salsa isn't going to make your mouth freak out or anything but you will feel some level of heat or spice. This did not deliver that medium level of heat or spice and it was so imbalanced with a strong sugary taste that I just didn't like at all. It was very much not for me. I think healthy options are really missing in this space. Most truly spiced snacks are really bad for you like Hot Cheetos or Takis, they also just make you feel awful after eating them. They are overly processed and chemical. I think natural flavors are key. Something can be a lighter snack but still pack a punch of flavor. I don't want to feel disgusting after eating but I do want my tastebuds to really wake up and respond to whatever I'm eating. 

I also think I am frustrated with false advertising, things are labeled as hot and spicy when they are truly not. HONESTY! I think I am not in this demographic - I do not see hot and spicy as a challenge or something to push through. I like the experience of spice/heat, so for me its about enjoying it and having my tastebuds activated and feeling excited about the flavors. I don't really see the point in trying to test yourself with foods. I want to try new things and experience new sensations but I'm not trying to see if I am ""strong enough"" to eat a whole ghost pepper or something like that. This notion seems a bit macho or like you are trying to prove something very very pointless. But I can see how it could be funny as well, I just think the ""challenge"" bit is not for me. 

I don't get into challenges like this but I do get very curious about how spicy or hot something might be. I've tried the dried red chilis in certain hot pot or Sichuan dishes just to know what it is like. 

I think I just like to satisfy my own curiosity and to have an understanding of different levels of heat / spice. So for me it was more about sampling and getting a sense of what other people might be experiencing. gets a deep satisfaction and sense of joy from a well balanced level of spice/heat in a dish or snack - the same way a sugar fiend might get great satisfaction from eating a sugary treat.   I would lean more towards the cayenne pepper and ghost pepper flavors because I love cayenne and have liked ghost pepper things in the past. I will say that I often find those flavors not hot enough, so I do like that there is a third, even more spicy option. But I would start with the first two, I think, and eventually try the third.   I would buy these to try as a snack for myself or to have as a snack with drinks with friends or my boyfriend. I bet these go great with beer or cider! So I would want to try it as a ""part mix"" or snack with drinks as well. I also just love a spicy / salty snack in the afternoon so I could see myself going for these in a peckish snack-y kind of setting. ",Scoville,ESFP

c. In the case of cheetos, it is a snack that I have known since childhood and knowing that there is a spicy snack left me no doubt about buying them. In the case of almonds, it was the relationship with the famous Chinese hot sauce that led me to buy it.

I like how they lull you in with a false sense of ""oh this is a spicy snack like spicy peanuts"" but then they engage a full blown sharp pain attack on your sinuses. The first time I ate wasabi, I ate too much because I think I'm tough, and it just really, really hurt my face - not even my mouth..

I'd be a wasabi peanut because some people enjoy hanging with me but I can see how for some people it can feel like your head is splitting in two. Brewdog

I love Brewdog in general, but they seem to do a lot for charity. They have the Brewdog foundation where they raise money for charity/fund charity events and I think they also really push for recycling/climate initiatives. Last week I seen that they were selling specially branded tins of beer to raise money for a dog shelter. I like how they could have just been another drinks/pub brand but decided to be more. Google?

Maybe Google, which might be an unconventional answer since they're one of the biggest companies ever.

Google starts new projects all the time and a lot of them end up getting cancelled after a bit of development (e.g. Google Glass), but I like that they try to push boundaries and develop new technology. Maybe 70 percent of it gets binned and causes them a bit of a loss, but the ones that stick tend to be quite innovative - e.g. Stadia I had to good this but I think I get it -- Wicked (food brand)

Wicked make vegan/vegetarian foods, only some of which I've tried. The food can be quite good, but the packaging to me gives off an 'honest' quality, as though it's based in nature and natural things. I think this makes me trust it a bit more which would make me more inclined to buy vegetarian food from that brand at a higher price than I would pay for a similar, less-trustworthy looking brand. 1. I'm crazy busy at work at the moment so my favourite thing is finishing work on Friday, tidying up anything about that flat that's annoying me, then lying up on the couch and relaxing for a bit.

2. At least once a week, usually Wednesday or Thursday, Rachel will convince me that we deserve a big dirty takeaway after having been really good and dieting for 1-2 days.

I don't think a food can be hot without being also spicy or vice versa. 

If I think of a 'hot' food, I think of something with simpler flavours. I would consider something like wasabi peas are almost entirely 'hot' because really theres only the simple wasabi flavour and a wave of pain. The heat in these is the main event and why its bought.

'Spicy' food has more flavour I think, and less focus on the pain. So I would consider Doritos Chili Heatwave, or Sahara nuts as 'spicy' but I wouldn't consider them as very 'hot'. I need to put 30 words in here, but I've written all my answers below! I can't see anything specific to be answered in this box, but let me know if I've missed anything! Huang Fei Hong Spicy Crispy Peanut 110g

I liked these a lot when I tried them - they are peanuts spiced with Sichuan peppercorn instead of just chili like you usually find. I tried them with friends and it was really weird and interesting because the peppercorns numb your mouth which I wasn't expecting. They're also really fragrant and had a nice flavour. I bought them myself then to eat, but outside of the social experience they weren't as fun and I never really snacked on them, so I won't buy them again. 

I think that they're a lot of fun to try with people, but when that fun is gone they lose most of what is interesting about them. My biggest frustration is products marketed as being super, three chilis, parental advisory warning spicy but barely tickle the tongue. It's so disappointing when I'm craving something actually spicy and I get a standard boring 'heat' flavoured snack.

There are some genuinely spicy snacks like Pepperami or some stuff which can be picked up in Asian shops, but in general there is not a large selection of actually spicy snacks, especially if you're only going to a local shop and not a super market.

I would like to be able to pick up a big red bag of crisps called 'spicy night terrors' and know that I'll need to pick up 2l of milk alongside it. A - It's a lot of fun because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much pain it causes, there's not any actual damage or risk involved. It's a universal challenge - people love to see people who can't handle spice totally destroyed trying to eat it, and also to see people who can eat intense spice deal with it with no issue. 

B - I haven't gotten drawn into anything regarding spicy *snacks* that I can remember, but I've had people just watch me eat some really spicy food in the past like phall, or crazy spicy Korean noodles and just laugh at me. 

C - I have a high spice tolerance so it's a lot of fun, I don't know why but I love the experience of eating something that practically ruins me for 30mins, I just think theres a lot of fun in it. I think there's a sense of ""I can do this and you can't"" to eating spicy food which makes the person eating it feel good. The attention from others and they're ""how can you do that?"" I think works as a bit of ego inflation, same as any other activity who sets a new personal spice limit everytime the current one is reached. Maybe a little too similar to Doritos and similar brands, I'm not sure it would stand out if placed in that environment. 

I think the Blue Diamond branding takes up a bit too much space, and the big blue shape takes away from the strong fire-coloured themes. With blue being such a cooling/calm colour it think it creates a bit of dissonance and it feels like the branding and the subbrand are fighting for space almost. My suggestion would be to at the very least, reduce the blue diamond branding by 20%+ to give the 'hot' colour more space and establish a firmer visual theme.

I think better descriptives could be used for the levels of spice - hot, hotter & hottest are very easy. Like you've said, people who really love spice are drawn to it in a big way by the challenge. I know I've been more likely to pick something up if it has descriptives like 'intense', 'pain', XXX', 'inferno' etc etc. I think these phrases would play a bit part in deciding whether I picked it up or not - if these nuts really are spicy, you want people to think they're ""pint of milk at the ready"" spicy, not boring ""Tesco microwave jalfrezi 3 chillies on the pack"" tongue tickling spicy. For myself and many other spice enthusiasts, we'll see a snack indicating 'hottest' and translate that mentally to 'touch above mild'.

I do think I would be inclined to pick these up if I came across them, but I think the packaging might need to separate itself a little more from what is already there to make sure I pick these up instead of a bag of Nobby's Nuts.  I'd start from the spiciest and work my way down as/if necessary. I think I would buy them, if I saw them in tesco tomorrow I'd buy them but that might be because I've been staring at them for 10 minutes. There's a chance I would walk past if I had no prior knowledge.   I work from home, sometimes snack on cashews/peanuts when I get peckish so most likely I would buy them to nibble on during work. If there was a small pack, I'd grab them as a snack at any time really, maybe watching a film ",Scoville,

d. These are great before a workout, or during the day when i am working at my computer.
e. Found them at wholefoods. I like the Paqui brand, but ever since trying their Ghost Pepper flavor and literally chugging milk in the airport, i have been scared to try again. I also dont think chips are very healthy, so i try to avoid them as a snack when possible. The Paqui brand is known as a quality spicy chip so i am sure i will give them a chance again someday. It doesnt feel like their is an ORIGINAL spicy snack- it seems like a brand just takes its existing prodcut and creates a spicy verison ( like chips, or cheetos, or peanuts, etc). I think thats why when i really am craving a spxit snack, i go for real food options- like tacos, buffalo wings, etc. When brands try to turn these flavors into a portable snack, its just feels like an unhealthy fake taste. a.

To begin to describe my day it all starts in the morning. I am a morning person through and through. I love to wake up early, usually between 4:30 and 5 am. I have always been this way, but one specific reason I have to be now is because with our industry in real estate, people want to see homes around their work schedule, so most times people will want to go see a house after they get off work at 5. But I have never had someone call me at 430 am trying to go see a home. That is why I work out every morning early. Although I am removed from sports, I value health a lot and I love to exercise. For me working out is just as much physical as it is mental. I begin my day with an early workout every day!

I would describe it as hot being something that really makes you sweat and requires you to drink water and really opens you up. I think on the other hand spicy is a lower level of sensation and a spicy food in my opinion can be eaten carelessly like chips in a spicy dip. Hot is a higher degree in my opinion. The two snacks below are some of my go too snacks. You will see that one just satisfies the heat level and the other has a place of somewhat trying to be heath conscious but still satisfy the need for heat. One snack would be spicy milk chocolate. I personally enjoyed eating it in a small portion but did not think that this flavoring combination was something that I would want to constantly have in my pantry to snack on. When I think of a spicy snack that is the best I want to crave it at all times when I am hungry. This was something that was not bad at all but for sure not something I would want again or all the time. What I would say is missing is a hot and spic chip that is health conscious but at the same time packs some of the best heat. What I mean by this is you can think of chips / Crackers such at nut thinks or pop chips that satisfy eating a chip and being more heathy than doritos or something along those lines but they just don't have the spice to compete heat wise with Takis or something like that. Takis are horrible for you but I continue to get them due to them having more heat than other chips. A. I love spicy and hot regardless of the challenge but I love competition and that makes it even better. I would compare it to sports. I am going to watch the game regardless, but the second I make a bet I'm even more interested. But without the bet, yes I would still watch the whole game. So with a challenge and heat I am always game.

I am someone who my first purchase will most likely be the whole line up and then once I figure out the one I like the best I will then continue to buy that one after. Most likely without trying them I will like the hottest flavor the best.   I would buy these in multiple occasions. Overall it would be for a snack. It could be morning, afternoon or night and I could see myself eating them. I need a little heat at all times of the day. Mostly I would see myself eating these as an afternoon or night snack.

(I count this as a different category then ""Healthy"" Yes I think there is a difference between the 2, 'hot' food is fiery and burns. Too me this is like Wasabi, all of my sinuses just burn like crazyyy where as 'spicy' is hot but can vary in flavor with lots of different different spices. I think jalapeños and habaneros are both hot but the flavor of their hot is very different.  I love hot and spicy but I tend to prefer spicy food, I don't enjoy eating food that is just too hot for the sake of being hot, I like to taste the flavor of the spicy. What makes these hot and spicy snacks better than others you have tried? What do you love about them so much that you keep buying them again?  
     I love potato chips and am always looking for different flavors and textures to try, whether kettle or ridged, or different shapes. 
    Siete Queso - healthier than buying normal quest, I don’t eat so much but for a treat every now and then.

Looking at the packaging, what jumps out and captures your interest? What makes you pick it up at the shop? 
    Poore Brothers - i like “intensely different”
    Kettle chips - i love the pepper that says HOT
    Zapps - the packaging is amazing, all the voodoo dolls crack me up, very whimsical and fun
    Siete Queso - The Siete brand tells the story of why they created there brand on the packaging, I like a good story.

When do you eat these? Do you pair them with anything else?
     Chips I will eat with lunch - sandwich, salad, really anything - i love Crunch and mix of textures. I’ll also eat them on their own in afternoon snack. Once in a blue moon with a dip of some sort like ranch or spicy yogurt dip.
    Siete Queso - not so often, if I’’m having mexican for dinner, or good for dip with lots of people coming over. Eat with tacos, burrito bowls, and chips and salsa

Where, or from whom, did you hear about them?
    Poore Brothers - my dad when I was a tiny tot
    Kettle chips - I think I discovered them at a bodega in NY around 8 years ago
    Zapp’s - I tried these for the first time years ago at Pot Belly Sandwhich shop
    Siete Queso - From my friend Amanda this year Wasabi Peas! I really want to love them but whenever I try them, there's one bad egg with wayyyyy to much with wasabi on it and it just takes over my sinuses in a burning way I'm not a fan of. 

I also want to love Snyder's Hot and Spicy Buffalo pretzels, they’re tastes delicious but never feel too great after eating them, they upset my stomach I found that Asia has soooo many fun and weird flavors of snacks of chips, nuts, and rice snacks, I wish we had that variety here in our stores. I feel like the American customer is a scaredy cat to try different flavors besides the usually “hot”.

Unfortunately there are many snacks I can’t try because they aren’t gluten and soy free!!! I understand making flavors requires a lot of chemistry but I definitely miss out because of this.

I will always try new spicy potato chips, never enough in my line up.

Always on the hunt for gluten free Buffalo/ ranch flavored snacks and waiting for the day when I can have Gluten free Spicy Pringles.

Wish I could get fresh fruit (mango) with the chili salt/ sugar dip more easily as a casual snack that stores sold. 1. What are your thoughts on eating hot and spicy snacks as a challenge? 
     I’m not so much of a challenge girl, I do love to try lots of salsas and hot sauces but I’m not trying to eat so much to make me sick.
2. When was the last time you got drawn into it? Tell us about it? 
     Probably the bugs in Thailand challenge that I submitted in 2
3. What do you get from these challenges? How do they make you feel?

Spices can be layered with great subtlety and be quite gentle when eaten - I think some spiced vanilla desserts are like that, as is some of the subtler cooking in Indian, Persian and Middle Eastern cuisines. With the exception of Indian cuisine they are not usually HOT, but they are spicy - layers and layers of flavour. It feels like a holiday to purchase my wasabi peas from the source, although I have no idea what the packaging says.

This is a weird one, but the brand that came to my mind was Curology, the skincare brand. They are an online skincare subscription service that works with dermatologists to custom make formulas for ever individual. They respect that everyone's skin is different, has a different history and different needs, and they aim to make sure they can create a product that will give everyone the results they want. They will even prescribe certain medications in their formulas that would otherwise be unattainable for people without the right insurance. For example, I am 25, about to turn 26 and lose my parents insurance coverage. I know that the tretinoin prescription I have now cost me $30, but once I lose my insurance coverage, the pharmacy quoted my refill to bee around $500. Through Curology's system, I can still get my tret script as well as their cleanser and moisturizer for $60. This was a weird tanget for this particular project, but I respect a brand that can see that there is an issue with the way some of our systems work, like health care and the insurance industry, and works with regular people like me to make sure our needs are still being met. I think the Trader Joe's brand is incredibly daring. The sheer range of products, both standard grocery items and eccentric snacks, meals, combos, and more is mind boggling, and even more mind boggling, it's almost always good! You like bao buns? Trader Joe's has a philly cheesestake bao bun for you to try. Do you like fritos chips? Well, they have a spicy street corn seasoned fritos style chip that is so good I'm not allowed to buy it anymore because I'll eat the whole bag in one day. Forget sugar cookies, Trader Joe's would rather offer you their corn cookie mix. I love that they aren't afraid to try something new and unconventional, like chocolate hummus or. everything bagel seasoned smoked salmon. Alexander Wang. He is one of my all time favorite fashion designers, and there is something so ground and just plain cool about him and his line. I also love that despite being a big fancy couture designer, he is willing to partner with more accessible brands like Uniqlo, so I can actually afford to have very functional and stylish items designed by him that didn't cost an arm and a leg to buy. It screams of humble swagger to be so above the snooty fashion elites and design an airy summer line that masses of people will find useful and wearable, rather than sticking solely to beautiful but ultimately unpractical couture.

I am a huge animal lover, and find immense happiness in waking up to find my cat cuddling me in bed. I also love punishingly difficult video games, like DarkSouls, that challenge me to use my wits and put my all into overcoming overwhelming odds in a giant boss battle. I also find great happiness in my skincare routine and in doing makeup and hair, for no other reason than to practice or because I want to feel a little extra nice one day. Cravability In everyday conversation about spicy food, I think hot and spicy are pretty interchangeable. The more nuanced differences between the two are there, but only if you're really digging for a distinction between the two. When I think of spicy, I think of a flavor profile that is working in harmony with the rest of a dish or snack. For example, a menu with something like ""Spicy Green Curry"" tells you that you're going to be eating a dish that has all the  creamy, coconutty curry flavor you'd expect but with a spicy kick blending through the meal. When I think hot, I more so imagine a hot sauce. A means to a spicy end. Not so concerned with melding flavors or elevating a dish, just something that coats your mouth in heat and brings the pain. This spicy snacks are better than others I have tried because all three are so bold with their flavor choices. Takis are some of the most actually spicy chip style snacks, but even with the bold spiciness they add in a super bright limey citrus flavor. 
Trader Joe's Elote corn dippers are some of the most unique snacks I've ever tried, where they really capture the essence of a real food and distill that flavor into an addictive chip format. it's not like a Pringles pizza flavor chip that is just this weird hybrid flavor that isn't very satisfying, they really, really nail the flavor. They aren't super spicy, but there is just enough of a kick that tickles the taste buds just that extra little bit. 
I really have a fondness for Wasabi peas and their less well known cousins, the Sriracha peas! I can remember eating wasabi peas as a kid in the car with my mom, where at first I asked what she was eating and she said ""Don't worry about it, you won't like it, this is a mommy snack."" That didn't sit well with little me, and I insisted on trying some. She thought it would be funny to see my reaction to wasabi at such a young age, but imagine her look of surprise when I actually loved them. She created a spice monster that day, and I still like snacking on these today! I would say I like the sriracha peas slightly better because they meld more flavors together, bringing garlic and chilis and a bit of sweetness to the dried pea as opposed to just in your face wasabi. 

The one thing I appreciate above all else in these snacks is that they didn't lose the flavor. They put flavor front and center, and then added in the spice factor around that flavorful base. These Trader Joe's Ghost Pepper Potato Chips made the unforgivable mistake of not actually being all that spicy! They were boring, only banking on the ghost pepper hype to draw people in. There is no other flavoring or seasoning that I can remember. If you are going to make a snack that is depending just on the chili powder in it to make it spicy, it needs to actually be spicy! Otherwise it's just another boring kettle chip. This is a healthier snack option, and I like the hippeas chedder puffs. I just wish they would lean into the spice a little more. It's only vaguely reminiscent of sriracha, like they wanted to give it the same flavor but were afraid to add any of the spice or bite of sriracha. I don't know how much I think of snacks as a spicy food challenge, since snacks tend to curb the spice level in favor of being able to market themselves to a wider audience. Thee crowd being pulled in for a spicy wing eat contest, or those who go on a quest to conquer the hottest Thai food challenges around their city probably don't get that same thrill from a Cheetos bag. The spice level just doesn't compare. For it to be a true spice challenge, there is a pain and discomfort level involved, I think. It's not a challenge to eat hot Cheetos, I just like them because I like my cheesy curls to have some spice. 
I have been in a habanero eating contest before at school, I think that's the closet thing to a spicy snack competition I have ever been in. It is a challenge to eat more habanero peppers than your classmates because it hurts and is awful to eat raw habanero peppers. There may be some thrill seekers out there who are into that, but I'd rather save my snacks for things I actually enjoy eating that happen to be on the spicy side of thing. puts more value in the Scoville number than the flavor factor   Absolutely, I love blue diamond and really trust them to be able to put up a snack that has great flavor. I have never opened a tin of blue diamond almonds and had them not taste like whatever they say they will taste like, and being a spice lover I would be so tempted to try all of these out since I'm always on the hunt for a new spicy snack and I already know I love blue diamond. 
   Depending on how flavorful and tasty they are being that they are just flavored with their respective pepper, I could see myself just casually snacking on the cayenne pepper almonds. They look like they are mild enough that I wouldn't need to cut them with anything else to be able to tolerate them, so they would be a nice, easy snack to eat on the go or while on break or even just watching tv at night. The ghost pepper nuts look a little but hotter, so I might be more inclined to find ways to mix them in with less spicy things, for example add them to a trail mix with other sweeter flavored and more neutral things or in a salad. The Carolina reaper nuts are super intimidating and I would be really scared to just crack open a can of them while watching tv for the night. They seem like more of a party thing, where you make an almond roulette wheel and enjoy the super spicy experience in very small doses with friends around to laugh at how ridiculously spicy and painful they are to eat.

Shared three photos and their relevance to my story below! Never Have I Ever (on Netflix) Milk (2% or whole) magic realism Along the Silk Road in Western China orange in my blue chair by my apartment's bay window in brooklyn when the sun filters through the trees on a saturday morning and I am eating burger king hash browns A Korean snack called ""Booshu Booshu (뿌셔뿌셔)"" (basically translates to crunchy crumble) –– basically ramen noodles that have a spicy powder to sprinkle a top and are made for actually eating (instead of boiling) in their noodly, crunchy form. I think I'd be this spicy snack because I love the crunchy texture, and the ritual of breaking the noodles in half –– and the spice is addicting! Citi –– a recent example is that they have been leveraging their Citi bike service in NYC to amplify voices over the course of the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests. They have been waiving overage fees 1x a week to support the Justice Rides through NYC. They are finding tangible, relevant ways to be a part of history –– and for that, I have respect. Frida is a brand that floats top of mind for the way it is head on addressing the really tough realities of motherhood without trying to make it more palatable or pretty. I feel that Frida has broken the silence in that regard, and shed light on how isolating and painful being a new mother can be, which is daring in a space that tries to maintain an entirely feel-good baby pink and baby blue facade. Taco Bell is the first thing that comes to mind –– I guess for its irreverent tone, and the way it has built itself to be an iconic cult classic. They keep reinventing themselves, it seems –– with a Taco Bell hotel, as a muse for inspiring Taco Bell art, etc. Also, their hot sauce packets – i mean, c'mon! the little messages on each packet – simple and so good. 1. Every morning I go for a long walk at a cemetary near my home, first thing in the morning. That sounds intense, but it really has brought me lots of joy, especially during the pandemic. I have met baby turtles, a flock of wild green parrots (yes, wild parrots in the heart of Brooklyn), egrets, a family of racoons, a peregrine falcon feasting on squirrel, and a beaver. Each chance encounter strikes an inner place of delight. 

2. Each week, I'll usually meet up with a girlfriend of mine. I meet with several people each week, but there's something about meeting a bestie in a female only space that is so restorative. Something about spending time with close girlfriends and laughing about our blunders and also our small victories helps me to understand and get closer to the woman I'm trying to be. 

3. Rosé saturdays –– this sounds super basic, but my husband and I started doing something called rosé saturdays each week where we grab a picnic blanket and a bottle of rosé and lie down in the grass reading books and napping under the sun. It sounds basic, but we have a hard time just relaxing, so this was a way for us to relax and delight in one another and have no agenda or plan except to watch the trees and sky above us. Texture There's a difference. Hot for me indicates the intensity of spice, whereas spice I feel has come to encompass just the general presence of a piquant / intriguing flavor (even if mild). Jerk-style Plantain Chips
b. What I love about these are that they are healthy, and not too heavy (since they're dried plantains), but because they are jerk-style, it almost feels like I'm eating something heartier and heavier that will hold me over for a longer time – like eating a savory dinner in snack form
c. I like the amateur looking red and yellow and green bright saturation, and even the amateur font style, which I feel is pretty standard for Trader Joe fare. I picked these up once on a whim and keep coming back to them after that. 
d. I eat these during classes (I have evening classes that goes right through dinner time). I'll also eat them sometimes with beer.
e. Just picked it up while browsing in store at Trader joes.

Thai Lime & Chili
b. the flavor is tangy thanks to the lime, and also substantial. I've heard nuts be described as ""nut meats"" before (i know it sounds weird), but somehow when eating these it does feel like ""nut meat"" level hearty because it has kind of a leathery heat that stays with you. 
c. I first got hooked on Thai Lime & Chili almonds via Blue Diamond's version of it in canisters – for some reason, i find the Thai spice almonds are always on discount in convenience stores and gas stations – but upon trying them, i found they are so dang good! So that's what made me get hooked in the first place. The packaging does not strike me in particular with the Trader Joe's brand (just generic packaging), it's more so my previous experience with the Blue Diamond version and the price point at which it was at (since almonds tend to be more expensive, I was open to trying a different flavor at a lower price and am happy I did).
d. I eat these in the middle of the day when I need a hold over – lunch is a meal that kind of gets glossed over in my day to day, and so I'll try to supplement with almonds like these. I would also pair these with beer.
e. Blue Diamond. Flamin Hot Cheetos. Many of my friends are die-hard flamin hots people, but I am die hard original. There is something so uncontrollably cheesy about the original version that I love, that the Flamin Hots just kills off for me. The spice hits too soon without the satisfaction of the cheese that I seek when I seek out cheetos. I think my frustration is lack of healthy options. Most options are saturated with sodium, and kind of take on the junky reputation and novelty –– but now, especially as I've left my twenties behind, I find that I am trying to be more careful about what I put into my body. Junky indulgences end up being for the moments that I 'cave in' – whether it's because there are no options around so I need to hit up the vending machines, or if it's the only snack that's being given out for free at a function that I'm at, or if I'm having a girl's night at a friends apartment and we cave in and buy the junky stuff. But that's more of the exception than the regular in my weeks. a. I think hot and spicy snacks as a challenge is more about the bravado than the actual enjoyment. I like watching other people suffer through the spice, but I don't know if I would opt into a spicy snack challenge at this juncture in my life because again, my stomach has made known that I cannot keep messing around like I used to in my twenties! 
b. The last time would have been my college years – on hungover mornings, going to eat pho and loading on sriracha as a challenge, the way college kids think of doing things like that. That was actually a conversion moment on spice for me though, because prior to college I wasn't so keen on spice, but the hungover sriracha mornings really sealed the deal for me. 
c. Again, I think it's about the bravado and the fun. Doing something just for the heck of doing it. Being humbled by tears and spice with friends I feel safe with as a way to be silly. I could see the merit of bringing spicy challenges back into my life now, more as a way to loosen up within adult friendships versus needing to be serious and talk about the woes of reality too much –– spicy challenges force you to not take yourself so seriously (at least that's how I would approach it), so that's something I appreciate. is open to letting go of control and certainty over the outcome of a food, and is willing to venture out of the usual suspects What I was trying to express in the video but couldn't find the words for –- the XTREMES text / color scheme strikes me a slightly bro-y.  Hmmm. That's a great question. I feel like I would definitely try the whole range to see which spice i like best, and then narrow down to my favorite and become a repeat buyer of whichever spice is my favorite. I still don't love the XTREMES fiery name / depiction, but I'd still be open to giving it a try.   I would buy these for road trip snacks, for if there was a picnic situation where beers were involved, also possibly in classier settings like a charcuterie with intriguing flavors of different cheeses, meats, smokey almonds paired with mezcal type drinks. I would eat and night or late afternoon, in the settings i just mentioned. ",Scoville,

She formed Tengri with Mongolian farmers, provided hundreds (now thousands) of Mongolian families with jobs to produce Yak Wool to create a more sustainable option for Cashmere. Tengri has single-handedly made a huge difference in the economy in Mongolia has a transparent supply chain. Balenciaga. Because they are always creating weird but interesting products. Adidas. It is affordable, but still trendy and instyle with younger generations. Enjoying exhibitions and art galleries with friends, and being inspired by creative minds and artwork.

Traveling to a new country/city and meeting my friend's family and friends. I love learning about other cultures and experiencing local lifestyles through my friends. Portion? I'm personally more interested in a snack I can actually eat more of, many spicy snacks have smaller portions, which doesn't really appeal to me. I would prefer to have a good-sized snack that isn't extremely spicy or heavy in the beginning, that I can keep eating and will gradually get more spicy. It's better for sharing and good to have during social gatherings. I personally don't think theres too much of a difference, although I do think of ""hot"" as more of a ""technical"" term for how much heat the particular snack/food makes you feel. I feel as if you can have spicy foods without too much heat, and thus, it'll be spicy without being ""hot"". My favorite are savory and spicy snacks: chips and salsa and Snyder's Jalapeno Pretzel Pieces and Crushed Instant Noodles (specifically the 统一 小浣熊干脆面 Raccoon Dried Crispy Noodles by Tongyi/Uni-President Enterprises). I also greatly enjoy the Nongshim Spicy Shrimp Cracker Sticks and Wasabi Peas. Spicy Chocolate. I liked the taste and thought it was interesting, but I didn't think it was amazing. I think the chocolate could've been more creamy and sweet. I have yet to find chips that balance the level of savory with spice well. Oftentimes brands would either focus on making it spicy but forget about actually adding flavor into the chips, or just not have significant amount of spice at all. I think eating hot and spicy snacks as a challenge is fun and appealing for a one-time thing, but unless the snack is really great, I probably wouldn't purchase it again. A large reason for this is because challenges usually put a heavy focus on how spicy the food is, rather than considering if it actually tastes nice. 
The one and only time i've been involved in a spice challenge was the spicy ramen challenge. It was fun and I greatly enjoyed experiencing it with my friends and introducing them to the Samyang noodles. I have a lot of fun during these challenges and feel a competitive rush, but I do oftentimes feel a bit disappointed if I feel as if the product did not live up to the hype (what happened with the Samyang 2X noodles). However, I do feel a sense of pride at the end of the challenge because I usually can handle the spice. genuinely loves spice and loves to challenge themselves and push their own boundaries If I saw this in the store I would be interested/confused with what ""Smart Snack"" means? If it means there's less calories/etc. I would definitely make sure to add what that means or maybe just have a simple ""Low Calories"" in the front.  I personally would try the Ghost pepper and Carolina reaper. If I was only going to get one, I would try the Ghost Pepper version first, and then Carolina Reaper if I liked the Ghost Pepper version. Because I am very familiar with the cayenne pepper taste and don't feel as if it is really spicy, I think I'd prefer to try a step up from that. However, I personally like snacks that are easy to eat and so I wouldn't make the full plunge and choose the spiciest version unless I liked the medium flavored ones.   I would buy them for myself to just snack on, but if I were to have a house party or have friends over, I might buy the whole range just to be prepared for different spice tolerances. ",Scoville,

Got it, I'm Ready! This would be concern, the desire to control what goes into our bodies. This statement would be burnt orange or auburn. Something warm. This statement would be savory or umami. It would indicate an everyday need for sustenance. Do you remember the film On Golden Pond? Something like that; grown up, mature. I'm sorry, I literally do not care about brands, and cannot connect with them. This would most definitely be home, wherever that may be at the time. You know that moment when you're mixing bread dough and the dough ball has come together perfectly? The gluten has started to work through, and you get that not too dry, not too wet consistency? Right there. I like to think of this as being mid afternoon. Was just thinking about this in task 13. Going with the dough ball allegory I've got to say the smell of yeast after it has been mixed into the dough, before it rests. I had the pleasure of making homemade pretzels with my oldest (19 at the time) and youngest (2) Christmas day 2019. This would be it. Continue As I mentioned in a previous question, my sons and I made our own pretzels on Christmas evening, 2019, in my kitchen at home. This was one of the very first times that I had made pretzels myself, and I was excited as I am always obsessing over learning new skills. My oldest son, Josh, who actually was working for me as a cook at the restaurant I was chef at came over and we spent a couple of hours mixing, rolling, and cooking the dough in alkali water before brushing them with butter and baking them. We let my youngest son, Steven pull the step ladder up to the counter and assist us in the rolling phase, much to his (and our) delight! I think making them brought Josh and I a sense of accomplishment, and all three of us definitely felt a sense of family, closeness, like it was ""boys night"" in my apartment. As far as eating the pretzels went, is there anything better than fresh, and homemade? Josh and I made some homemade queso, and the three of us felt satisfied as we enjoyed our work.

Enough rocky road, peanut butter haystacks, grandmas chocolate chip cookies, and fudge to last another week. Family. Together. Always. Christmas Eve 2012, at Grandmas old house, making grandmas famous chocolate chip cookies with grandma, my momma, and sister. We always start with some visiting before making the cookies. We sit and visit for awhile and then get started. My grandma already has out all the ingredients we need like flour, baking soda, salt, butter, sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, eggs, chocolate chips, chopped nuts, and last but not least, my grandmas secret ingredient. A combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices. She has prepared a few parchment lined cookie sheets. We get started making the cookies. Grandma has me preheat the oven to 375°F. My mom gets started with measuring out the flour, baking soda, salt, and my grandmas secret ingredient and puts it all into a bowl. My grandma starts to beat the butter, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in her mixer. She adds the eggs, one at a time, cracking them precisely, no shells, almost as if she's been doing this her whole life. Oh wait..she has. My grandma is Italian and her cooking and baking has always been phenomenal. She then starts to slowly add in the flour mixture my mom made. I then start to stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. We all get our own spoons and start to spoon it out drop by drop onto the parchment lined cookie sheets. Making these cookies brings a sense of nostalgia and love. I think back now to those memories and almost want to cry. I wish I had a time machine to go back and truly be grateful during those times. If anything back then I probably looked at it as a chore, baking with grandma. If only I could bake with her now.. My sister puts the trays of cookies into the oven to bake. We sit and visit and clean up the very few dishes this dessert made along with the very few ingredients. Approximately 10 minutes later, the oven beeps and the cookies are done. They are too hot right when they come out of the oven so my grandma insists that we wait until they cool off a bit, so we do and we wait around 10 minutes and then finally, we dig in. I get myself a glass of milk along with a couple cookies. They're not too hot where they'll burn you but still hot enough to be ooey and gooey. Its like grandma knows exactly when its the right time to eat them. Grandmas cookies are like nothing else on this earth. Sweet but salty, mixture of chocolate and nuts, and my grandmas secret ingredient. A combination of cinnamonny, nutmeggy, sweet goodness. I feel so happy eating her cookies. So incredibly grateful. They're sweet enough to be able to devour several but not too sweet as to where its overwhelming. ",Rise,

It was December 23, 2019, ""Christmas Eve Eve"". I'm not sure if I enjoyed the eating or making, more! But, I think I liked watching their brains work and learn something new, versus eating it.

Here you think you have chocolate chips with this statement, but then you find out it isn't chocolate, but raisins when you read the part about never waiting long for something sweet and always looking out for products that show I care. I think this statement would be like a thriller/suspense, more specifically a M. Night Shyamalan film.  The twist at the end is that I didn't care all that much because I ended up cutting corners and didn't get the best baking products or they really didn't make things all that easy. This statement would be Duncan Hines.  Duncan Hines make several baking products that are easy to make and doesn't take long to make. I would think this would be Paris, France.  When it comes to baking and indulgent pastries, Paris has things covered.  You can get your sweet tooth easily satisfied there. I think this would be soft.  When you get a craving satisfied and get your indulgences met, it can feel like your are floating on a cloud. At sunset, the most blissful, serene and relaxing time of day.

We normally have some left overs if we can't give any to our friends, which we couldn't this time because of social distancing.  However there really wasn't any left.  The brownies came out great, had that taste of Irish creme without be overwhelmingly tasting like alcohol, and it added a good flavor to the brownies that wouldn't have been there had I went with the directions of the box.

Continue My favorite baking memory to look back on is baking my very first sourdough focaccia bread. Over quarantine I saw many people jumping on the sourdough journey. It was something I have wanted to try for many years and I felt I finally had all the time to do so. It took me many tries to finally figure out how to create a sourdough starter from scratch. After much trial and error, my starter finally passed the float test so it was time to start exploring. A close friend of mine passed along an amazing recipe for sourdough focaccia created by myperfectloaf.com (my go-to site for anything sourdough related). I chose to top mine with cherry tomatoes and rosemary from my own garden, Kalamata olives, flake sea salt, and Italian olive oil. The thing about baking any bread is that it takes patience. First, you must feed your starter, then mix the dough, and go through many rounds of stretch & folds to build the gluten and create that delicious, chewy & airy texture. Patience is something I am sometimes lacking, so the practice of making bread has been something that is good for me. I remember seeing many focaccia fails, so when I pulled mine out of the oven and saw the beautiful airy texture, I was delighted. Even better was being able to share this with my boyfriend and his family and receive their kind compliments.

The whole process was very laborious and timing all the rises and feeds was the most difficult part.  Finally I decided I was ready to go for my first bake.  Call it beginner's luck but it turned out surprisingly ok.  The bottom was all burnt and stuck to the pan but I ripped that part off.  What remained was so edible and so satisfying.  Shared it with my wife -- didn't have the patience to let it cool for more than 5 minutes, it was still hot inside.  It felt like the culmination of many weeks' effort, delayed gratification from that first false start almost a decade ago.                The things I miss most are social gatherings.

I went to the farmers market and bought the last kobocha squash they had.  It was damaged on one side, so the farmer gave it to me half-off; I don't mind buying produce that is damaged because normally the imperfections are superficial and it's a waste not to use something for this reason!

The emotion that comes to mind is pride- taking pride in what I put into my body and what I feed to my family. Green- I have no idea why other than green feels organic and healthy For some reason my mind goes to cinnamon oatmeal flavor A feel good comedy- something that leaves you off better than when you walked in The brand that first comes to mind is KIND Bar. Followed by Sweetgreen Salad. Paris. Everytime i go to europe I feel like i eat really well without any of the side effects of Amercian food ( bloated, fatigued, sugar highs/lows) A texture of Crunchy meets hearty- warm but not hot. instantly i think of 11am on a sunday. Just feels like the perfect time. Cinnamon sugar and butter simmering in a pan on the stove. Sitting around the kitchen island with my 3 nieces talking to them about where they want to go to college. Continue My most recent baking experience was also my most memorable. I am a Big Brother with the Big Brother Big Sisters Association and twice a month i meet with a young kid name Joel as his  mentor. For this occasion we decided to bake via Zoom ( since we couldn't be together because of the pandemic).  He loves Nutella and since it was getting cold out we thought making Nutella s'mores would be the perfect combo. We went step by step over Zoom, showing each other how the mixing was going, pre heating the oven, tasting the batter before it was done etc. For me, the best part was getting creative with the recipe, introducing something new to him, and then watching him eat it and love it! It wasnt the healthiest thing we could have made ( although we used gluten free graham crackers and organic chocolate ), and I actually only ate a bite of it, but the process of making it together was the real joy.

I would be a confetti cupcake with confetti frosting.  I would be made with a cake mix because I'm a little impatient so its quicker and I don't like a huge mess.  But I don't want to be too plain and like to have fun so I would add the confetti.  A little sweetness on top and I'm ready to go. Got it, I'm Ready! It would be enjoyment because I would make my family happy. It would be pink because it is a soft, pleasing color. It would be dark chocolate because it would be just the right amount of sweet without being too much. It would be a romantic comedy because it would be light and fun. I think it would be Lauren Conrad because it would be quality but not too expensive. It would be a movie theater because it would provide choices and be fun, entertaining and they would have snacks. It would be velvet because it would be soft and smooth. It would be noon.  Right in the middle of the day. It would be vanilla bean because it would be pleasant but not overpowering. It would be the moment right before you fall asleep because it is a relaxing, peaceful time. Actually, this was very recent.  My adult daughters and I wanted to make Christmas cookies to get into the holiday spirit.   We did not want to make it a production that was very time consuming and messy, so we bought 2 rolls of refrigerated sugar cookie dough.  We rolled it out and each of us was in charge of different tasks.  One rolled and cut the cookies with cookie cutters.  
I sprinkled  them with colored sugar and 
baked them.  My other daughter did the decorating.  We had Christmas music playing in the background.  We didn't expect much, but the cookies were delicious and that's when my husband and son came into the picture - they helped with the eating. ",Rise,
412470,Leslie,Penny,leslie4pr@aol.com," Since I was home all the time, I baked more, but I found I was baking whatever we felt like and not necessarily thinking about healthy options.  I was baking more comfort types of snacks.  I like baking in general, so I loved making cakes and cookies for special occasions as well as making muffins, breads, scones, etc, on the spur of the moment.   If I am not enhancing a boxed mix, then I have the sugar, white and brown, flours, eggs, spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, etc. and the fresh ingredients like bananas, carrots, etc.  It does take time, but I always clean up as I go and I since I love baking, I am fine with it being a bit more messy and time consumer.  I use my mixer, my loaf pans, etc. my timer and oven.   Okay, so I have make a lot and the first batch was simply delicious, but they didn't last because my immediate Family was there salivating and waiting to taste them.  They all loved them and kept coming back for more!  It was just before dinner, but that didn't stop them.  They had dessert before dinner and one of my sisters was so full, she skipped dinner.  It's always a great feeling! My chocolate (oatmeal)chip cookies.  I was making them for Christmas for my entire extended family because loves them.  I actually made them early on Christmas Eve when my immediate Family was home and where I could prepare them while talking to everyone.  It was planned so they could be fresh for the next day, but spontaneous in the exact time, since everyone had a different schedule that day and I love talking to myFamily when baking. My family especially loves my breads and sweets, but sometimes I make something that I never expected to be so good that they will ask for it again.  I recently made a carrot cake because I had the carrots, and it was savory and sweet at the same time.  And we love eat in general, so a lot of baking can be for breakfast, a mid-day snack as well as a dessert after dinner or a late night bite, depending on our preference.  Sometimes, I will add a special ingredient to a boxed mix and make my own creation.",Rise,

In short, sass and spice and everything that's nice! I'd be a chocolate cupcake for sure. A classic but you just can't go wrong with it. I am basically a sweet person and get along with most people - a crowd pleaser. Got it, I'm Ready! Love. The need for healthy baking stems from being crazily in love with your family, which in turn prompts me to keep a closer watch on what they and I eat. It would be a rainbow because it brings joy and good tidings ahead. Also, who doesn't get excited to see a rainbow! If I had to choose one specific color, then red - the color of love! Vanilla. The urge to protect your family and watch over their health is a very basic instinct. Basic, but potent and strong. Family drama. Healthy baking can be a hit or a miss. I've had as many grumpy faces as grins with my attempts at baking healthy I've been seeing this brand called Simple Mills. I've tasted their almond flour crackers and it was good. They seem to have healthy products like gluten free baking mixes and cookies, vegan frosting, etc. My kitchen. Because that's where all the action happens. It's pretty much the health control center of my house Dry, imperfect. To me, many gluten free recipes that I have tried have turned out dry and very rarely looks like the picture in the recipe. Takes a lot of time and practice to get it right. Dessert time! Both after lunch and dinner. I mostly bake sweet treats and I have quite a big sweet tooth. I like to eat a little something sweet after my meal so that's probably when I would indulge! Sorry, can't think of anything. It would probably smell of whatever I am baking at that time. Chocolate, vanilla, pineapple, etc. When I won a Valentine's day caption writing contest! A moment about getting something right, joy, victory and of course, some good prizes. Continue This was in June 2019 at my home in New Jersey. My bestie and her two adorable kids (they are almost like my kids, I love them!) were visiting from SFO and I hadn't seen them in a year. We had all these plans lined up, one of which was baking. We always like to bake together and it's a fun activity that the kids and I like to do. This was around the time I had started experimenting with alternate flours.

We decided to make vegan chocolate cupcakes with oats flour. Coconut oil in place of butter and maple syrup in place of sugar. When baking with kids, they like to be involved or they get bored easily. So while I measured the flour and mixed them, they sifted the flour, added the ingredients and spooned them into my mini cupcake pan. We decided to make mini cupcakes so we could have more pieces. While the cuppies were baking, they took a break and I made a Nutella Cream cheese frosting - nutella, cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar. The recipe called for frosting with coconut cream but I didn't have that and they were very eager to frost the cakes so I went with what I had.

The kids frosted the cupcakes. By then, my napping toddler had also woken up and they had a whale of a time decorating the frosting with sprinkles. There was just SO much sprinkles ona tiny mini cupcake :))) I think it was the fact that I was baking with my girls again that made the whole kitchen mess so totally worth it! They just couldn't believe that they baked with oats flour, they were so excited! They were travelling by train to Philadelphia the next day, so they also packed it up as a train snack, along with some pasta. And I was so happy that they had gobbled it all up by the time they reached there.

Taste wise, no concerns. But yes, they were definitely drier than the regular APF ones that are more moist. The frosting compensated for the dryness though. The texture didn't bother the kids too much though - they were just thrilled to eat what they made!                I miss my time! I had more free time before Covid hit. Also, my kid had not started school yet so I was able to bake whenever I wanted to. For Christmas 2019, I remember baking fruit cake for my neighbours and chocolate cake for my friends - all healthy bakes. I don't even remember what happened to Christmas 2020, it was that chaotic!

They know I like to read and eat good chocolate, and I love getting together with them to find out what is going on with them and what they are planning. Chocolate Fondant- the warm fudge cake with a self saucing center- they are a deep chocolate experience (I think I am quite deep- I never take anything at face value, and am always thinking), they are perfection- cooked too little and they aren’t ‘cake’ enough (or cooked), and cooked too much the sauce disappears and they are too dry- you’ve got to get it just right, and I try to be just right. Oh, and chocolate is my life- I cannot survive without it. Got it, I'm Ready! Pride- I feel proud I am doing a good job to feed and look after my family. Green- green is a great color in nature and I feel like I am sticking to nature more when I back from scratch. Fresh- I like to cook with layers of flavor so that the food is interesting and helps people to feel happy. Family- am thinking ‘Mary poppins ‘- making sure that everyone and everything is ok. I think of Chobani here as a brand- not for the baking side, but for the goodness of the brand and the cleanliness of the ingredients. Kitchen Table- I like to bake both with and for my family, and I like for us to gather to enjoy the tasty food. Warm and fluffy- I am thinking cake/baked goods- foods that feel like a nice hug. It starts in the morning- I like to bake around 11, and then food is fresh for lunch, or cakes can be eaten for afternoon tea. Golden- like cakes and biscuits- a yummy cooked sugar smell. Family time together- day to day, nothing special, but about connectedness and love. Continue There was a nice example of this recently- at Christmas time. As we are from England we miss some of the traditional favorites- a big one is ‘Yorkshire puddings’. In England you can buy a ready made product, or a mix in a sachet- but what is best is to make it from scratch. This year, I made fresh for me and the boys- and I also made a gluten free batch for my husband as a surprise. He was delighted. I felt super excited making them, especially knowing they were not expecting them and that they would be delighted. I was super happy when they saw them and they beamed with joy, and the first thing they put onto their plates as we gathered to feast, was the Yorkshire Puddings I had made. I knew what was in them- they were healthy, fresh, and nostalgic too. I brought joy to my most special people through food, and it was great to see them tuck in. I enjoyed eating them too- but the biggest high was seeing their joy and satisfaction.                I used to bake more for special occasions I think- definitely birthdays, and celebration days. Anything we wante din between we probably bought in a store or restaurant. During COVID we have baked more for everyday- so it has become more of a ‘normal’ than special thing, and I think I quite like that actually. I get to bond with the kids, and we get something that I know what has gone into it. I do miss going into a store and choosing my own ingredients- its a little hit and miss right now what we will get from week to week (seems pretty random) - but we manage, and we do what we can.  I miss the ‘safety blanket’ of being able to buy something if the baking goes wrong- we had my husbands 40th birthday over the summer, and so he had what we could bake (which was a gluten free dairy free cake- we did the best we could :) ) - I knew I couldn’t go out and get anything as an alternative, but as I said above, we manage.

They are diverse because they come in a multitude of colors, flavors and fillings.

I like challenging myself, learning how things work, traveling and trying new things. Got it, I'm Ready! It would be happiness, joy, satisfaction, efficiency, flexibility and comforting. It would be bright and/or warm colors. Spring, summer and fall colors. Things such as teal, bright yellow, oranges, sage green, citron and/or chartreuse. It wouldn't be one singular flavor. It would be various things like milk chocolate, dark chocolate, lemon, lime, ginger, meringue, sugar and cinnamon. It would be a rom-com, drama, or maybe a romance drama. Pinterest because it has a variety of recipes that are for all skill sets. As well as recipes that are quick and others that are more detailed. It would be Costco or some type of grocery store or big box store. It would be a variety of textures. Crunchy, chewy, soft and moist. Early morning for making/baking sweets. But mid afternoon and evening for the time of consumption. The smell depends on the time of the year. But it's usually the smell of something sweet. It would be something like lemon, lime, cinnamon, cloves, chocolate, vanilla, pumpkin or apples. It would be a fun, relaxed, happy, non-stressful moment. I made smore's cups. It was described as an easy recipe on Pinterest so I figured I make it. I had a LOT of marshmallows left over from a trip this late summer. I was looking for recipes to use up some marshmallows.

In the early fall I made the s'mores cups to bring to a friends and for my spouse to bring into work. Everyone loved them...they were super easy to make. My spouse has a smaller office so I made individual boxes with a bag of chocolate pieces for everyone to take home to share with their families. I slightly altered the recipe for easy transport, just put the chocolate pieces on the individual smores before putting under the broiler for 3 minutes or until lightly golden. They all texted pictures to my husband because they apparently liked them so much.

I didn't think they were that impressive when making them...they were just graham cracker cup cookies with some marshmallows and chocolate. But everyone loved them...they were super easy to make. Maybe because you can heat them up and that emotional enjoyment of having the warm chocolate and toasty portion of the marshmallow makes it good....plus they are way less messy to eat than a traditional s'more.

I’d definitely be a strawberry shortcake dessert! Full of sweetness! I feel I can appear “plain” meaning not over-the-top but still approachable but once you get to know me you’ll see that I am a fun person. Got it, I'm Ready! I feel it would be happy but also a bit adventurous. This would definitely be yellow as it seems very friendly and inviting. This flavor would be vanilla as it goes well with quite a bit; easy to pair! This would definitely be a mixture between comedy (exciting) but also a mystery because it can be a challenge (that I absolutely love, however) finding things to whip up to spruce things up a bit. This would be Betty Crocker, a well known brand that is well respected and enjoyed by many families around the globe. This would be the beach, my happy place! It’s relaxing knowing you can enjoy yummy treats even when time is very limited. This would be creamy/smooth because it is a texture many love and who doesn’t love convenience? This statement would be night because night is a time to relax and convenience makes things easier and smooth, just like bed time. This scent would be freshly baked cookies which are warm and inviting and I’ve never met anyone who disapproves of that aroma. This moment would be a great family memory such as a family reunion once its deemed safe to gather with our loved ones. Just this past holiday season, I was making sugar cookies with my children. Despite it being hot outdoors in the middle of winter (hello, Southern California) my children asked for some yummy treats to enjoy after dinner. We decided on sugar cookies because we had the ingredients on hand and we had all the garnishes you can imagine too. We spent a short amount of time on the actual preparation (the baking took longer) but my kids ended up asking to make the decorating portion a fun and exciting activity, to which we all enjoyed! Being able to spend time on decorating (versus preparing and baking) was fun as we did nibble on some cookies while decorating. We don’t always spend that much time on decorating but it was refreshing to take some time and do something all together that we all enjoyed. ",Rise,

A strawberry shortcake croissant. Croissants are great for any time of the day and for any occasion- I'd like to think that I exhibit the same versatility in making new friends, finding new grooves in different situations. A strawberry shortcake croissant is even better. You get the sweet taste of the shortcake filling, and the added bonus of the fresh strawberries on top. I like to think that I bring a little extra pizzaz and sugar to the regular ""croissant"" identity! Plus, I just really love strawberry and croissants and the strawberry shortcake croissant is the perfect combination. Got it, I'm Ready! A fierce, protective love that encompasses a desire the give the people I love the best things possible. A teal or turquoise green. Better-for-me ingredients invoke thoughts of natural, organic, earthy ingredients. Anything almond-flavored, with the slightest touch of honey. An almond/honey flavor combo. A feel-good Pixar movie, made to be enjoyed by the family. Annie's! What also comes to mind is Kashi and Hershey (the ""healthy"" brand lines under Hershey- including Brookside). This statement makes me think of my home, or my local neighborhood bakery/cafe. A yogurt-like texture. Smooth and creamy, with layers of flavor, but nothing that is too overpowering. Morning, but only on a weekend, because weekend mornings are the best times to bake and the best time to do so with the feeling that you've got all the time in the world. The smell of fresh-baked cookies. So cliche, but the warm, cozy feeling of fresh baked cookies is the first thing that comes to mind. Beyond baking with my partner, this statement is like drinking hot chocolate and eating marshmallows with a blanket wrapped around you as you watch the snow fall outside along the Manhattan skyline with your partner. Your dog is running around your apartment, it's the weekend, and you've got all the time in the world. Continue My favorite baking memory is baking dumplings with my partner. We were trying to make a combination of Chinese dumplings and their Tibetan counterpart, Momos. This was years ago, but it is still one of my favorite baking memories because I was trying to replicate the process entirely from memories of when I was a little girl and I would spend Saturday mornings baking and making dumplings with my parents. I was trying to teach the process to my Tibetan partner, who was in turn trying to teach me the way of the Momo, and although none of the dumplings or Momos came out editorial ready that day, I had the best time sharing the memories and stories behind the process with my partner. I always feel like I've achieved the ""highest level of baking prowess"" when I've been able to master something entirely from memory and not have to consult a recipe. The process of baking dumplings with my partner just made me feel warm and happy, and they were delicious to eat (although I have to emphasize that they were not magazine-cover worthy, just delicious-tasting worthy). What made this experience so enjoyable was everything from start to finish- visiting the local Chinese food store to buy the ingredients, trial and error as I tried to recall memories from when I was much younger, teaching my partner how to mold and shape the dumplings and in turn watching him teach me how to do the same with Momos, to baking it and seeing and eating the final result.                I used to primarily bake things that I knew how to do- and sometimes out of a pure necessity. If there was something that I grew up eating or that my parents baked for me, but is not sold in stores or restaurants, I would have to bake that on my own. Prior to COVID, I also never really had the time to experiment and follow ""mini passion projects."" I was afraid of spending time that would end up a ""failure"" which meant that I was not exploring different recipes and ideas nearly as much as I do these days. ",Rise,

But overall, lemon bars are a treat that everyone likes. Got it, I'm Ready! The emotion I most associate with this paragraph is joy This statement in my mind mostly matches to the color white because that is the most common color for baking ingredients The flavor I most associate with this statement is cinnamon The movie genre I most closely associate with this statement is romance The brand I most closely associate with this statement is Betty Crocker The place I most associate with this statement is my kitchen The text I most associate with this statement is soft and chewy, like a cookie The time of day I most associate with this statement is nighttime The smell I most associate with this statement is freshly basked chocolate chip cookies The moment I most associate with this paragraph is baking something with my wife One great baking memory I have is being a little kid (probably around 8-9 years old) and helping my Mom make pecan pie for Thanksgiving. So let's say this was around November 1996. At that age, I was already interested in cooking and baking, but we didn't do a lot of baking at my house outside of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thus, it was something I looked forward to every year. We'd usually go to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving and bring a mix of store-bought and freshly baked desserts. Sometimes we made pecan pie, sometimes pumpkin pie, and sometimes cinnamon rolls. These were all delicious of course, but for some reason the pecan pie sticks out in my mind the most.

I think this experience was so enjoyable because it was quality time with my Mom, and because it made the whole house smell so good. I also enjoyed licking the spoons and bowls at each step of the project. ",Rise,

Probably a simple yellow cupcake because they are delicious and you can accessorize them with whatever toppings you’d like. Got it, I'm Ready! If this statement was an emotion it would be happy. I think baking is so fun. Not only are you making something delicious you can enjoy with family but you can get really creative with it. For years I have baked my kids/families birthday cakes because to me it is so fun creating something cute/beautiful for everyone to enjoy. I have a baking section in my pantry with tons of Wilton's cake decorating products, sprinkles, even books with ideas and have used every piece multiple times. I would say that it would be bright pink and blue. For some reason when I think of happy moments while baking I always have those memories with the brighter colors. Probably because when I am decorating for my kids birthdays those are the colors I am using the most. Chocolate. One hundred percent it would be chocolate, when I think of dessert, even though I love all things sweet, I think traditionally my brain always goes to chocolate, whether its brownies, chocolate frosting on a fluffy yellow cake, chocolate decor on top, etc. Romantic comedy. I think for me, the romantic comedy genre are the movies that when you are done, you can watch over and over and over. Do i love other genres, of course, who doesn't love a good horror film during Halloween, or a sappy drama? But when I think of that happy emotion I get when I finish baking three tier cake, with rainbow layers and a fondant unicorn horn for my daughters birthday, I think about how happy it makes her, it makes me realize how easy it would be for me to put in that work over and over again. Well, since my mind is on baking, it would be Wilton. I love their products. by no means am I a professional when it comes to baking, but I love that their products make everything so easy. There is literally a product for anything you might need when it comes to baking, whether its parchment paper, frosting tips, chocolate molds, food dyes, decorating trays, etc. If this statement was a place it would be home. I think this is where we enjoy all these treats the most, especially more recently with Covid not allowing us to be out and about. Not only is it where we eat but its where we make these treats. Easy, I think the texture with be thick and creamy, like chocolate frosting. I think the best part of a cake or cupcake would have to be the frosting you put on top to tie it all together. Evening would be the time of day in which we indulge in these yummy treats The best part of baking is the way it makes your house smell. I think for me I think of the smell of yellow cake in the oven. The delicious smell travels from room to room and eventually you can't escape it. I guess the moment would be a birthday. I typically only bake for special occasions, just because even though sweet treats everyday sounds heavenly I also have to be a mom and consider our health first. So when I think of baking my mind goes automatically to birthdays. I hate to relate so much of this to Covid, but this past year has been really hard for everyone. I was happily pregnant with our third bundle of joy, and our families all live in different cities so seeing them often was not an option. I think the most enjoyable memories I currently have from baking are the virtual birthday parties we have thrown for my kids and our families. Every birthday my daughter (4) and I have baked a cake and decorated. By the time we finish we have eaten most of the frosting and sprinkles, then once the cake is ready we zoom call both sets of grandparents and both aunts and have a virtual birthday party. For my daughter who was turning 4, we had a unicorn birthday party with my husband, son and new born daughter. Then we called both sets of grandparents, and both aunts to sing with her. But all day we prepped. We ordered pizza and baked cookies & a unicorn cake. Since we had a newborn the whole family helped out and my daughter, the birthday girl helped make her cake. She loved it.

1. Non dairy will always appeal. I like the combination of ginger and honey. I think it might be an interesting add to coffee or hot tea.
2. Not sure of thickness or spiciness of ginger. Almond milk not as thick as cream (when used for coffee) and won’t know until I taste it
3. I might try drinking it as a beverage but not sure. I stopped drinking milk years ago and mostly drink water. It may taste great! Otherwise for sure  I would have in coffee or use in cooking such as pancake mix etc
4. Avoiding dairy, aware of benefits of ginger, natural honey as opposed to sugar.
V Vanilla, Chocolate Sea Salt
1. You had me a CHOCOLATE and SEA SALT. Because I love them.
2. Unsure how much sugar is added. It would be nice to have a Stevia alternative as Stevia works well with chocolate, I think. I try to avoid sugar
3. I would probably try drinking this as a breakfast beverage hot or cold. Maybe throughout the day
4. I think anyone who is a chocolate fan would try this. Women love this!
IX Settler (Kefir)
1. I try to drink or eat at least 2-4 oz of fermented beverage or vegeys 3x a day. Kefir is dairy so it would be great to have non-dairy alternative.
2. Obviously, taste would be an uncertainty, but I would want to give it a try
3. I would use this probably once every day or so in small glasses
4. People who are concerned about their digestion will want to try this
XVI Mexican Chocolate
1  Again, I’m captured at chocolate and the cover picture works well too. I assume it has cinnamon as well. Sounds yummy
2. No real concerns
3. I would most likely have this in the morning, but maybe at other times especially hot on a cold day
4. Anyone familiar with Mexican chocolate flavors especially will go for this.
XV Uber Breeze
1. Chocolate and the idea of a meal replacement is a reminder of the days I thought Instant Breakfast was a good deal for my kiddos~ Sounds delicious
2. Again, kit would be nice to taste it at a sample bar. We always wonder too how high is the sugar content
3. This would definitely be on a day when I have to run out the door without eating.
4. Busy people - which is everyone at one time or another IV Honey Vanilla
1. The product representation and packaging don’t match so I have to assume there are 2 varieties. This says honey vanilla. Text says ginger and honey.  Either way if using honey, please use RAW natural honey and emphasize that. There are some pretty cheap honeys out there with little or no health benefits. 
2. If ginger, words explaining the digestive etc benefits of ginger. In either blend, mentioning it as a beverage plants the thought that it is more than a “creamer” for those who want that. Always emphasize health benefits 
V Vanilla, Chocolate, Sea Salt
1. Excited about ingredients but also calcium, magnesium and natural minerals. 
2. Stress how the above can benefit our health- many don’t know there is magnesium in chocolate and women especially are often low in that
IX Settler
1. the fact that you are introducing fermented products is a big plus. And that it is non-dairy
2. This fermentation is a piece that has been missing from our diets and is necessary for healthy digestion.
XVI Mexican Chocolate
1. The fact that you even added cayenne and nutmeg sounds wonderful. Great spices! Intriguing
2. Stress the detox, digestive and anti-oxidant benefits. Many of us are seeing that
XV Uber Breeze
1. Chocolate flavor with fiber and packed with nutrients - 
2. meal replacement option with added protein etc. IV HONEY VANILLA

V Vanilla, Chocolate and Sea Salt

252384,Erhan,Erdem,erhanerdem@gmail.com,"Start XIX (complete boost):
I am excited about it because it is a quick easy snack that would satisfy my hunger on the go. I have a reservation about the potential sugar amount in it. I'd use this product mostly on the go as a quick snack. This product appeals to people who have a busy life but still want to stay healthy. 

XX (complete plus):
Similar to concept XIX, this also is a great way to satisfy your hunger quickly in a healthy way. I like the chocolate photo in the image, gives me the impression that there is chocolate in it. Concerned about the sugar amount. It's most appealing to busy people who want to live a healthy life

XXI (yoghurt coated bar): 
It's not messy, it is easy to carry, probably light too. I am excited about all those aspects. One reservation I have is whether it will taste good with the ""coated yogurt"". It must be in solid form so I wonder how yoghurt would taste like in that form. I'd use this product as a quick breakfast or as a quick snack on the go. Most appealing for busy people on the go. 

XXIV (smoothie):
It looks delicious. I like it that it combines fruit with almond milk. After all smoothies have milk in them anyway and with this product dairy is replaced with almond milk. I'd be concerned about the sugar amount. I would use this after exercising or on a hot summer day. It's most appealing for people who like smoothies, kids or adults, people who like to exercise.

XXVIII (probiotics plus):
I like the idea of combining probiotics with almond milk. It is exciting to me that a product like this would be very healthy. I don't have any reservations about this product. I would drink this product anytime of the day really. It would appeal to mostly health conscious people. XIX:
To me the most exciting part of this is that it is ""superfood"" but that is not amplified much. Does this mean it has one of those superfood antioxidant things in it? Needs more clarification

XX:
Just like XIX, the superfood aspect of it is exciting but needs more amplification and clarification

XXI:
The yoghurt part is exciting but needs more amplification as to how much yoghurt is it going to have. Is it going to melt? 

XXIV:
It's exciting that this product is not just almond milk but it also has fruits and vegetables in it in smoothie form. I don't think it needs any more amplification

XXVIII:
It's exciting that there is probiotics in it but is not clear on how/where that comes from XIX:
C. Why would I be interested:
Life is fast-paced and meals often get skipped. I need a great tasting,
drinkable and nutritionally complete meal replacement to get me
through the day. A superfood that includes everything!

XX:
C. Why would I be interested:
I am conscious about my diet and what I put into my body for living a

I get older. I need more superfood than ever to replenish my body.

D. Concept description:
Introducing Complete Plus by Blue Diamond, a balanced mix of

be healthy. Almond Breeze Complete Plus is a rich, creamy and satiating
drink that is packed with superfood.

XXI:
C. Why would I be interested:
I have a lot on my plate and my busy schedule doesn't always allow
for me to sit down and prepare a healthy meal. I need something
that's close to hand and that provides me with essential nutrients and
energy, and still be healthy and filling. Something that has the benefits of both non dairy and yoghurt

D. Concept description:
Introducing Probiotics Plus by Blue Diamond, a refreshing almondmilk
packed with nutrition including protein and probiotics and no added
sugar. With active cultures in every eight-ounce serving, it's an easy and
delicious way to get some good into your routine. XIX and XX: they are both packed with superfood so I assume it has a lot of antioxidants and vitamins. Those are all nourishing things. I think superfood in these concepts need to be emphasized more to point out how nourishing they would be.

XXI: I would expect to have full almonds in this product which on itself is quite nourishing as it is packed with protein and good fat. Yoghurt adds the probiotics on top of it, which needs to be emphasized more. 

XXIV: it is packed with vitamins for sure because it is full of fruit and vegetables. 

XXVIII: I think the anti oxidant aspects of probiotics need to be emphasized more to show that it is nourishing.    ",Milkshake,
225797,Duncan,Lawrence,duncanalawrence@gmail.com,"     Almond Breeze Maple
1. Anything maple catches my attention! With a hint of maple flavor, it could really make some almond milk pop.
2. Maple can be a hit or miss flavor - while it can be a nice flavor addition, it sometimes can either be too much or too little depending on the person. That would make me a little nervous to purchase, but I would give it a whirl as a sample. If it's good on the first try, I'd use it again - if not, I'd write it off.
3. I would use this as a nice treat.
4. Anyone from a maple syrup producing state! I'm from Vermont originally and love anything maple - I can be pretty picky about maple syrup specifically, but I'm willing to try it whenever I see it on a menu somewhere. I think that it would also be a nice treat for my daughter - something a bit sweet but not too much of a sugar blast.

Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative
1. I'm always looking for an alternative here. I like condensed milk, but I'm happy to try something different. I wouldn't hesitate to try this instead of regular condensed milk - it's an easy sell for me.
2. It could change the flavor of my recipes significantly, so the first or second time I try it may be a bust.
3. For cooking! I would likely see it when I'm purchasing condensed milk and consider if my dish may benefit from this switch. I probably wouldn't seek it out beforehand, but instead encounter it while out and about.
4. Anyone who cooks!

Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. Mexican hot chocolate? Sure! I'm not really brand loyal for my hot chocolate alternatives (besides Swiss Miss being the default), but if I'm going for something a little more interesting I would definitely try this out. I love a little spice in my hot chocolate.
2. No real reservations - besides maybe price. If it's too expensive I won't buy it often.
3. Adults would be the go-to, I believe. Ones looking to elevate their hot chocolate experience. I don't think that kids would really want to have this, but maybe some kids are more interested in spicy treats than I was.
4. People who grew up drinking hot chocolate, live in cold climates (or during cold season), who want to not drink the same stuff they drank as kids.

Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt
1. Anything that is chocolate and sea salt gets my attention!
2. I have absolutely no idea what this would taste like. Chocolate and sea salt is a pretty intense flavor, and it can go either way. Add that to almond milk and I haven't a clue. I would still try it, though.
3. In the morning - seems like a nice alternative to my coffee some days, usually on the weekend.
4. People looking for a treat. Kinda health conscious, but more flavor conscious.

Almond Breeze Horchata
1. It's horchata! I have memories of a boozy horchata drink at my favorite Mexican restaurant in Somerville, MA.
2. Though I have had numerous horchata drinks, I have no idea what to do with it. Do I add it to things? Do I drink it?
3. I'd want to make a boozy drink with it for brunch.
4. From my perspective, someone who enjoys the flavor of horchata is likely on the youngish side and has encountered it at coffee shops or restaurants. Almond Breeze Maple
1. Since I'm from Vermont, if you are confident about where the maple syrup comes from, emphasize that. I am probably 2-3x more likely to try something if it's Vermont maple syrup versus generic maple syrup. I understand that is sometimes hard for companies to determine (due to sourcing issues), but if you can actually say the place where it's from, name it loud and proud!
2. Is this a treat, or is it a normal milk alternative? I think that it's a normal milk alternative, with a sweet kick, so emphasize that it can be just used as a wonderful glass of almond milk.

Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative
1.  Shelf-stable and a bit healthier than condensed milk? That sounds great. I always feel gluttonous when I use condensed milk, so if I could get the same benefits/enjoyment out of this alternative, that sounds like a win for me. So emphasize those pieces!
2. Though it says coffee, that's probably not how I would use it - but I drink my coffee black. I would emphasize the cooking benefits of it. If I saw this used in a Bon Appetite recipe, I would definitely grab it and give it a whirl. So if you can help me be successful with this in a recipe, then that would be great.

Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. It's hot chocolate for the rest of us (aka adults)! Focus on the elevation from our childhood experiences, a way to enjoy hot chocolate without having to reach for the ubiquitous Swiss Miss packet.
2. Amplify that this is a non-dairy hot chocolate option, and the marketing could focus on the adult side. Right now most hot chocolate is focused on the kiddos, so this is a way to enjoy hot chocolate ourselves.

Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt
1. Depending on the sea salt you plan to use, it might be a good callout here for a partnership brand. Being from Portland, everyone knows Jacobson Salt and anything with them on their label is an easy purchase. Might not be possible, but it would be neat to see!
2. This sounds like it could be an easy drink on the go, so focus on that. I don't generally think of milk or milk-alternative drinks as something that I would grab while on the run, but this sounds like that kind of treat to me. Emphasize that option!

Almond Breeze Horchata
1. I have no idea how to actually use this, but it is the product I am most excited about. So maybe that's how it can be emphasized - with its use cases!
2. Focus on the flavor here. I think people are open to any horchata (at least I am), but emphasize how delicious this one is. Almond Breeze Maple
C) Maple syrup is a natural, delicious sweetener that brings a feeling of home and place whenever I taste it. I trust where it comes from, and if it's added to almond milk, then I have a greater trust in this product being one that I will like.

D) Introducing Maple by Blue Diamond, a non-dairy almondmilk touched with the natural joy of maple. Enjoy this healthy drink with your family as a great way to start the day.

Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative
C) Indulge yourself without the health guilt from condensed milk.

D) You're an adult, now eat like one.
Introducing Condensed Milk Alternative by Blue Diamond, the plant-based can of love that will help add body and a smooth finish to your drink or meal. Vegan friendly and eater approved.\

Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
C) Hot chocolate is the perfect way to indulge on a cold winter day - and being able to enjoy some hot chocolate with almondmilk and spices just amplifies the internal warmth that such a beverage can bring.

D) Mexican Hot Chocolate by Blue Diamond elevates your cold weather day with an almond-based, slightly spicy hot chocolate treat. Enjoy the drink without the worries on your digestive system, and feel healthy with a healthy boost of antioxidants.

Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt
C) Chocolate and sea salt is the new peanutbutter and jelly. If these ingredients are listed, then I'm sold - it's bound to taste good!

D) Introducing Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt by Blue Diamond, a grab-and-go drink that is packed natural minerals including sodium, calcium and magnesium, and a taste that can't be beat.

Almond Breeze Horchata
C) Horchata horchata horchata, it just breezes off the tongue. If I can pack some vitamins and minerals into a drink, and have it still taste good, I'm in.

D) Almondmilk Horchata by Blue Diamond gives you the blend of Almondmilk, barley, sesame seeds, rice, and tiger nut that you crave, with the sweet and cinnamon flavor that elevates any drink. Almond Breeze Maple
1. Anything to get my kiddo to drink almondmilk is great - and since I already trust maple, this seems like the perfect avenue to get her to enjoy some. Two products that seem great must make an even healthier product, right?

2. Everything in here comes from a tree: almonds and maple syrup. From a tree directly to you. That sounds healthy.
Focus on this being for everyone in the family - adults may not want a glass, but they could add it to some coffee. Kids would probably love to just have a glass of it.

Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative
1. I always feel gross when I open a can of condensed milk - there's just something about looking at the goopy mix that makes me know it's not that healthy, though quite delicious. So if almondmilk is a better choice, I'm in. I would much rather use an almondmilk alternative if it means less sugar and a healthier option - there are too many other ways to get sugar.

2. Focus on the lower calory option of the alternative, especially since it's usually added to fairly rich recipes, anyways. Anything to help lower that feel would be positive.
Since it's often used in recipes, it is often families making something for the nourishment of the kids. So position it as being a healthy option for the kiddos, made for parents.

Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. Honestly, this one just sounds tasty. It seems like a great way for me to up my hot chocolate game, so it nourishes in that I will enjoy some spicy hot chocolate, but not that I'm worried about the nutrition.
However, kids that are lactose intolerant would have a lot of trouble with regular hot chocolate. This is a great way for everyone to participate and enjoy the ritual.

2. An indulgence with a nutritional treat.

Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt
1. This seems like a great option to buy while on the move, maybe while traveling or needing an easy drink while walking around town. I could see this in a Portland bodega-style place (we have a vegan-specific bodega here) that I would buy for my kid while we are out and about. A much better alternative to a soda or other sugary juice.

2. Better than juice.
A taste you can believe in.
Keep the family feeling healthy and happy.

Almond Breeze Horchata
1. I just want to add this to a boozy brunch. Seems like a win to me. It'll nourish me in that I'll take a nap later.

198761,Flávia,Oliveira,flaoliveiraberenguel@gmail.com,"Start 1. Almond Breeze Nutri +
What I liked the most about this product is that it is enriched with protein and calcium, and also contains vitamins and fibers. I always prefer to buy products that are fortified with some vitamin or mineral, or that offer some extra benefit. I have no reservations about this product, but I would like to know how much sugar it has. I would drink at breakfast, at night before bed, in vitamins, smoothies and in culinary recipes. I believe this product will appeal to all people (men and women) of all age groups who care about a healthier diet and also those looking for products with a higher content of protein and calcium.

2. Almond Breeze Kids Complete
Really, it is not easy to find truly healthy foods for children nowadays. I liked this product, because besides being healthy (rich in vitamins and minerals) has a practical packaging, can be consumed anytime and anywhere. Again, I would like to know the exact amount of sugar the product has and also if there is presence of dyes in its composition in order to avoid allergy pictures in children. I would give this product to my child to consume at breakfast, take to consume at school and at intervals between meals. I believe that all parents who care about providing healthier food for their children would be interested in this product.

3. Almond Breeze Cardamom
This was one of the most interesting products for me, precisely because I have difficult digestion, constipation and intestinal gas, so I'm always looking for products, preferably healthy and natural, that improve my digestive health and, consequently, provide me with a better quality of life. I have no reservations about this product. I would consume a daily dose, preferably before lunch. I believe that this product will attract people who care about their health, especially digestive, and of course, those people who already have some digestive problem.

4. Almond Breeze Blast (Adult)
Without a doubt, what I liked best about this drink was the mixture of flavors! I imagine it to be a very refreshing and delicious drink, besides being super nutritious, a fact that attracted me too. I have no reservations about this product, I like that there is no added sugar. I would drink this product at breakfast, take to consume at work and on long trips. This product will surely attract people who enjoy a tasty, refreshing and healthy beverage, and especially who like a mix of flavors.

I really enjoy trying new healthy drinks and new flavors, and this drink is a mix of flavor and refreshment!

Certainly, people who enjoy a healthy, full of flavor and refreshing drink will be attracted to this product! 1. Almond Breeze Nutri +: I liked the product concept, and above all, the nutritional benefits offered by it (higher protein and calcium content, B vitamins, Omega 3, flax and fiber). To improve, I think Blue Diamond could highlight in the packaging the percentage or content of proteins and calcium that the product offers.
 
2. Almond Breeze Kids Complete: It would be interesting and would make the product more attractive if Blue Diamond emphasized in the product packaging itself the vitamins and minerals present in the product, as well as the reduced sugar and fat content. Also, I find it interesting highlight on the packaging that the product does not replace a full meal.

3. Almond Breeze Cardamom: I would change the design and layout of the packaging as I found it unappealing (looks like a medicine bottle). Also, I would highlight the benefits of the product for digestive health on the packaging label. It would not change anything in the concept of the product, it was the concept that I liked the most!

4. Almond Breeze Blast (Adult): I liked the label, the flavor mixes are pretty obvious, but I think the packaging could have a more modern and contemporary design. Also, it could be highlighted on the packaging label that it is a product with high nutritional value. It would not change anything in the concept of the product! Really enjoyed!

5. Almond Breeze Nut Sparkle: I quite liked the design of the packaging. It could have bottles of different sizes. I would emphasize on the product label that it is a carbonated and non-alcoholic almond nut beverage and in the description of the concept, instead of ""A beverage full of flavor,"" I would write as follows: ""Delicious and healthy hydration with a hint of nut"".

B. What’s the main idea: A sweet and healthy almond-infused sparkling drink.
C. Why would I be interested: I like to keep hydrated and drinking enough water is absolute key to this. But I also enjoy delicious flavored drinks and juices. With keeping an eye on the nutrients and antioxidants in my diet, I enjoy trying new drinks that are healthy, raw and with minimum-ingredients.
D. Concept description: Introducing Nut Sparkle by Blue Diamond, a non-alcoholic, carbonated almond nut drink with a distinct amaretto flavor. Delicious and healthy hydration with a hint of nut. 1. Almond Breeze Nutri +: I and my family would consume this product typically at breakfast. I would also use it in the preparation of vitamins, smoothies and in cooking recipes. The most important point that makes this product nutritious is that it is enriched with proteins, in addition to contain calcium, B vitamins, Omega 3, flax and fiber.

2. Almond Breeze Kids Complete - I would give this product to my child to consume at breakfast, take snacks to school and also in the intervals between meals. What makes this product nutritious is that it contains vitamins and nutrients essential for the health and well-being of children on a daily basis.

3. Almond Breeze Cardamom - Everyone in my family would consume this product, especially me who have digestive problems (difficult digestion, constipation and intestinal gas). I would consume daily, preferably before lunch. Among 27 products, this maybe be the healthiest and most nutritious because of the natural healing properties of cardamom.

4. Almond Breeze Blast (Adult) - This product would be very welcome for my family's breakfast. Also, to accompany a snack, after physical activities and on long trips. This product alone is already highly nutritious, because in addition to almond milk still counts on the vitamins and nutrients of fruits without added sugar.

5. Almond Breeze Nut Sparkle - I would consume this product as a substitute for soda and especially on warmer days, on the beach or in the pool. This drink, besides helping to hydrate the body, has antioxidant action that contributes to the prevention of premature aging.    ",Milkshake,
225801,Jeanie,Demoss,jsheyngis3@yahoo.com,"Start Honestly, there were 8 products that really excited me and 3 more that have real potential. I am going to go ahead and mention all of them so that they are still on the shelves one day, but go in detail about the 5 must haves! It sure is exciting that you have must have products in development and I can't wait for them to be available. The 5 that I have to have, somewhat in an order of excitement and originality are: 1. Almond Breath Broth 2.  Almond tea night time 3. Almond Breeze Blast 4. Almond Breeze Pure 5. Cardamon
1. Almond Breath Ranch Dressing (in a glass bottle and in refrigerator section would be a lot more appealing and higher quality. 2. Almond Breeze Yum Cup (hate the name though). I want it to be in glass jars, with a lid and they can be more of a Greek Yogurt size jar. Maybe they can be exciting by adding granola or almonds to the cup. 3. Almond Breeze Pasta sauce is very exciting but I would want it to be in a glass bottle and very creamy. 


Almond Breath Broth 
1. What excites me the most is the idea of a healthier broth and a creamer option then what exists now. I think the texture would give you more soup and sauce options to cook with. I can see this being amazing because a lot of broths have a lot of sodium and this can eliminate and give it a different, creamer texture that is exciting to have without the dairy. 
2. Will it be higher in fat, will it taste too nutty, will it be easy to add flavors for a great flavor? 
3. Soups, sauces, stews, starches, cream based recipes, chicken, quinoa, oatmeal. Breakfast or dinner because they are more involved meals that are cooked at home. 
4. A health conscious person who cares about nutrition, but flavor just as much. They enjoy eating flavorful, healthy foods and cooking with higher quality ingredients but don't have a ton of time to spend cooking every night or to spend a fortune on eating healthy. 

Almond tea night time
1. That it has natural ingredients to help me go to sleep, it is comforting and soothing sounding. I would be excited to try different flavors such as honey and milk, Valerian root helps with sleep, or even a cocoa flavor, mint. 
2. How it will taste, will it really help with sleep?
3. When feeling run down, at night before bed, when it is cold outside, when you are ready to relax.
4. Adults that want to relax, need a little help getting sleepy, someone who enjoys hot drinks and don't want a coffee or tea. 

Almond Breeze Blast
1. I love the idea of a tasty almond alternative to milk and looks like a juice box. I like the idea that it is drink kids will love and not have the need to have a sugary juice or milk (which we do not have in our house and our son does not drink.
2. The flavor not too be too nutty, easy on the sugar, smooth texture. 
3. Breakfast or lunch for the kids. 
4. Kids, teens if came in a larger size. 

Almond Breeze Pure 
1. The idea that it is the cleanest almond milk. But it does make me question what is different and why isn't what I already use by AB not as pure. 
2. What makes it more pure or is it just a gimmick and why is it more pure, I want to trust that all the products are just as pure?
3. When making smoothies, protein shakes, creamy soups, and other recipes that call for milk. 
4. Healthy conscious people. 

Cardamon
1. I like that this reminds me of a natural type of remedy such as Apple Cider Vinegar. I also love the idea of gut health and digestive help. I do not like any of the probiotic drinks so I can appreciate a different option. Plus it seems like it might be more effective because it talks about IBS issues. 
2. Is it too strong, will it work, is it like a detox, how are the almonds apart of it or what do the almonds have to do with it at all.
3. When feeling bloated, nauseous, have a tummy ache or digestive issues or pain. 
4. Someone who does not want to be bloated or wants to have a natural remedy to ease their gut. 1. Almond Breath Broth - the benefits such as more protein, a different flavor profile, creamier consistency for more uses then just broth, a great alternative. The benefits that can be amplified are that there is more protein, a healthier, very low sodium broth, creamy texture. 
2.  Almond tea night time- a natural remedy that helps you sleep. The flavors can be amplified and how soothing and calming it is for the body and mind. 
3. Almond Breeze Blast - Calcium, vitamins, protein and great flavor for kids to enjoy and mom's to know that they are eating something great. I think the benefits are nicely amplified, maybe just the nut based protein just needs to be discussed as well. 
4. Almond Breeze Pure - That it is the best quality almond milk. How much protein there is in each serving and how there is no added sugars. 
5. Cardamont - A natural way to cure a bad gut. Amplify it by talking about the individual benefits of each ingredient. 1. Almond Breath Broth - More Nut based protein in each cup, sodium free, creamier, more flavorful, a variety of uses, a great cooking tool, vegan. 
2.  Almond tea night time - Helps relax, added nutrition, a delightful night drink, delicious and calming. 
3. Almond Breeze Blast- A great alternative to juice and milk, less sugar, more protein and nutrition, a delicious smooth shake for kids to enjoy and mom's to feel good about. 
4. Almond Breeze Pure - The purest form of Almond milk, organic, made from a local farm. 
5. Cardamon - A great natural alternative to your gut issues. Soothes your stomach and get's  you back to feeling like yourself again! 1. Almond Breath Broth - I can see this product nourishing my family because I would make more nut based soups because right now they are all so high in sodium that I chose to not even use them very much or as much as I could. It provides nourishment with more nut based protein, low in sodium, and good fat from nuts. 
2.  Almond tea night time -It is so important to get good sleep, this would help my husband and I to get to bed so that we are not cranky or tired the next morning. The important points are that the ingredients are good for you and soothing so that you are refreshed each morning to start your busy day. 
3. Almond Breeze Blast - A great alternative to sugary juice and sugary milk that is served at school. Even drinkable yogurts are full of dairy and sugar. I am excited for my kid to drink something that has good ingredients, vitamins, and will help him get through the rest of his day by getting some good energy, instead of a sugar rush like the other drinks provide. 
4. Almond Breeze Pure - Gives me assurance that my family is getting the best and purest almond milk. Main points are more protein per cup, pure ingredients, thicker texture, good fats. 
5. Cardamon - Good ingredients that help sooth your gut so that you are not feeling bloated all day.  It is always great to have natural alternatives to gut health.    ",Milkshake,
198797,Patricia,Lamont,patricia@lamontmail.com,"Start My top 5 Product Concepts are:

A. Almond Breeze Pure
B. Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
C. Almond Breeze Cardamon
D Almond Breeze Yum Pot
E.  Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing

Generally I am excited about these five products since they all fill a gap with an improved product in their respective current line-up or offer a brand new , tasty, and healthy alternative to what is already available in the market.

A.  Almond Breeze Pure
1. Specifically Almond Breeze Pure provides a healthy plant-based refreshing drink without ingredients that I am familiar with or understand.  This is a welcome change to what is currently available and takes advantage of the trend to eat real, natural food which I am especially excited about and following as much as possible. 
2. The only downside or reservation is that I am assuming that this product would have a shorter shelf life, but I am willing to take that disadvantage for the advantage of a pure and natural product with only 4 or 5 ingredients that I understand.  
3. I would most likely drink this product at breakfast or anytime during the day that I want a refreshing boost.  
4. This product would appeal to the health conscious that is following a natural diet and is not necessarily looking for instant, convenient food but rather optimal nutrition and taste.

B. Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
1. Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar excites me since I have not been able to find a plant-based, good-tasting bar that is high in protein for times that I am too busy to have a meal.
2.  The only reservation is that the sugar level may be high and/or saturated fat.  I hope that you can devise a bar that is good tasting based on the good taste of almonds, fruits, and yogurt without added sugar and bad saturated fats.  I certainly hope so since there are none that I have been able to find that are also plant based and high in protein.
3.  I would eat this product likely after a gym workout or if I do not have time for lunch at work.
4.  This would appeal to busy people who do not always have time to sit down for a healthy meal, but need to keep working; either mentally or physically and need a quick, good-tasting, and healthy boost.  These customers also need to be health conscious as to not replace a meal with a chocolate bar or other similar snack food.

C. Almond Breeze Cardamon
1.  I am very excited about this product since I do suffer from IBS and indigestion and cannot find a healthy, good tasting solution to help me through this problem.  There is currently nothing in the market that I am aware of, so this product fills an unmet need among digestive sufferers or those that want to maintain a healthy gut.
2. I do not have any reservations about this product and only hoping that the delicious flavour of cardamon is sufficient and not too light!
3. I would most likely drink this product at bedtime to ensure my digestive system has the defense to rebuild it during rest at nighttime.
4.  This product would appeal to anyone who suffers from digestive issues or anyone that wants to maintain a healthy digestive system.

D. Almond Breeze Yum Pot
1. I am excited about this product since I do have a sweet tooth and I do not have many alternatives to a healthy end to healthy meal at the moment.  This solves a unmet need for those among us that have a sweet tooth and want a plant-based, non-dairy solution.  Currently only pudding and yogurt is available that resembles this product.
2.  The only concern that I have is that I wonder about the consistency.  Will it be able to be smooth and creamy like yogurt and pudding?
3.  I would eat this product after dinner or while watching TV when I am looking for a healthy snack.
4.  This product would appeal to all health conscious people and especially those that follow a non-dairy diet.

E. Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
1.  I am the most excited about this product since I am lover of raw veggies but cannot find a healthy dip that is not loaded with sugar and fat.  Currently there is not much available unless you want to use hummus, which is not a dressing.
2.  I do not have any reservations about this product.
3.  I would use this product anytime that I eat raw veggies, which is approximately three times a week.
4.  This product would appeal to anyone with a love of vegetables and salad, that is looking for a healthy, low-fat alternative and especially those that follow a non-dairy diet. A. Almond Breeze Pure
I would emphasize the health benefits of drinking almond milk and list calcium and protein on the box.

B. Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar.
I would emphasize the health benefits of this bar and list the total protein, calcium, sugar, and fat on the package.

C Almond Breeze Cardamom
I would emphasize the health benefits of this drink and list the equivalent in terms of probiotics or Kombucha drinks.

D. Almond Breeze Yum Pot
I would emphasize the taste with relevant and delicious food photos on the package to make it more tempting i.e. pieces of chocolate, a lemon, etc.

E. Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
Once again, I would list the low-fat benefit of this product and emphasize it on the bottle. 1A. Almond Breeze Pure
B.  Five Ingredients (and I would list them to show that it is indeed simple and pure) and one extraordinary almond milk.  Nothing else, just pure goodness!
C.  Why would I be interested?
A back to basics pure and simple  drink that tastes great and is also good for you.
D.  Concept Description:
In the world of highly processed, unnatural food we are introducing Pure by Blue Diamond - a refreshing product with 4-5 simple and pure ingredients that brings flavor to life. Together these pure and natural ingredients provide a fresh and creamy taste with all the goodness you expect when drinking almond milk.  On its own or as part of a smoothie or  your favourite recipe, pure is proof that when you start with something pure and simple; extraordinary things can happen.

2A.  Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
B. Main Idea:  An anytime, plant-based healthy and good-tasting super snack delivered in one bar to keep you on the move.
C Why would I be interested:  I have a lot on my plate and my busy schedule doesn't always allow me to prepare a healthy meal or snack.  I need something in my car, desk, or pantry that provides me with essential nutrients and energy, and still be healthy, good-tasting, and filling.
D. Concept Description:  Introducing Yogurt Covered Bar by Blue Diamond, a yogurt coated almond-based fruit flavoured super snack with x grams of plant-based protein.  A soft and chewy baked snack supercharged with maximum goodness and in two delectable flavours for when you need them.

3A.  Almond Breeze Card Cardamom
B. Main Idea: The healthy and good-tasting way to build and maintain a healthy gut and digestive system using the natural healing properties of cardamom.
C. Why would I be interested: I want my body, mind, and spirit to be in balance.  They say the gut is a second brain in the human body so it's vital for me to keep it in check and nurture it the same way I do fpr the rest of my body, mind, and spirit.
D. Concept Description.  Introducing Cardomom by Blue Diamond.  This new almondmilk cardamom infused drink is a centuries old effective remedy for digestive health.  The benefits of digestive health are many and include less heartburn, intestinal spasms, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), intestinal gas, constipation, liver and gallbladder complaints, and loss of appetite.  All you need is to drink a daily dose to keep your gut in check and to prevent so many digestive related issues.

4A.  Almond Breeze Yum Pot
B: Main Idea: The rich, creamy, healthy, and good-tasting way to satisfy your sweet tooth.
C. Why I would be interested:  I crave something sweet occasionally, but most of the options available are full of sugar or are dairy made.  I want to find something that satisfies my sweet tooth and is good for me at the same time.
D.  Concept Description:  Introducing Yum Pot by Blue Diamond, a non-dairy milk alternative pudding pot that will tantalize your taste buds with its creamy freshness and is ready to eat.  Yum Pots are made with Blue Diamond Californian grown almonds and are transformed into a delicious, creamy, yet light treat to be enjoyed anytime and anywhere.

5A. Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
B. Main Idea:  A creamy,  tasty, low-calorie ranch dressing without dairy.
C. Why should I be interested:  Salads and raw vegetables are a staple in my diet and for entertaining, but conventional dressings and dips  can really escalate the allowable calorie intake for the day.  Having a tasty, low calorie, and dairy free dressing would keep me, my family and friends healthy. 
D. Concept Description: Introducing Ranch Dressing by Blue Diamond, a delicious creamy ranch sauce that is rich in flavour, made with non-dairy quality ingredients and is also low in calories and low in fat.  From the makers of Almond Breeze and using quality almond milk,  so you don't have to compromise on taste for a healthy dipping sauce and low calorie dressing. The benefit of all of these products and in my top five particularly is that they provide high quality nutrition without the dairy and fat that is in current conventional available products.

1. Almond Breeze Pure - an alternative to milk and/or other sugary drinks such as carbonated fruit drinks or pasteurized juices.  To be served at any time, but particularly at breakfast with cereal, on its own, or a base for a homemade smoothie.  The simple and few ingredients should be emphasized as ""eating more real food"" is becoming an important food trend and highly processed foods are becoming to be shunned.

2.  Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar - an alternative to high sugar, high fat bar that are currently on the market and that are largely based on whey protein.  These bars would come in handy after a gym workout, soccer practice for the kids, or in between meals especially if there was no time for lunch at work!

3. Almond Breeze Cardamom should be positioned as a preventative measure for digestive health.  This drink will compete with the new popular Kefir and Kombucha drinks with probiotics hence the benefits of cardamom needs to be compared and emphasized.  If looking for a non-dairy alternative, Kefir is not suitable so an important gap is being filled as this product is non-dairy.

4.  Almond Breeze Yum Pot - this product is a treat or an ""extra"" to satisfy a sweet tooth craving but at the same time it is healthy and hence provides nourishment at the same time.  A good alternative to pudding for children's lunch boxes or for an adult treat at any time.

5. Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing - Since I eat allot of raw vegetables, but not without dip, I am the most excited about this product since I have not been able to find a healthy, low-calorie, good tasting dressing product to use.  Children and adults may eat more raw vegetables if a tasty dip accompanied them.    ",Milkshake,
198803,Enza,Scialfa ,smmiley73@hotmail.com,"Start Let me start off by saying that as I was going through this list of products, I had one of two reactions for each.  I either loved it or hated the idea.  That being said, let me start with the first idea.

  Product Concept XVI (ABX) ALMOND BREEZE FARM STYLE

This product excites me because I rarely drink Almond milk on its own because it is too watery for me.  I substituted my milk products for dietary reasons and though the effects on my body are great,  I often miss the thickness of creamy milk.  This has me dreaming of the creaminess of milk with the goodness and benefits of AlmondMilk.  Milk is derived by dairy farms and the claims that this Almondmilk will deliever a farm style thick and creamy alternative has me very excited.

I am interested to see how they deliver on these claims of delivering a delicious thick and creamy beverage.  Are there extra additives added to achieve this?  Thats my only reservation 

I would definitely drink this beverage in the morning alone or with my morning cereal

This beverage will appeal to someone who may be transitioning from dairy milk to an  almond alternative .  


Concept two Product Concept XXIV (NP/S) AlmondBreeze Smoothie

I use my Almond Breeze mainly for smoothies.  Having a smoothie already blended and ready to go really excites me.  It saves me from the messy morning hustle of trying to get my breakfast smoothie ready.  This would certainly make life easier for those busy mornings,  quick post workout snacks. 

This would appeal to the person who is pressed for time and needs something quick and ready with all the nutritional goodness, without compromising taste and nutrition 

Product Concept XXX (OtG)

Almond Breeze Iced Coffee
 
This product excites me because not only is it a non dairy iced coffee but the flavour and consistency is reminiscent of a frappucino.  This almosts makes me feel that I can have my cake and eat it too.  

The only reservation I would have is being skeptical of the taste.  

I would definitely enjoy drinking this on a hot day where a hot coffee is not appetizing.  Quenching my thirst with a ice cold coffee relaxing on the deck reading a good book

This type of drink would be for people who love cold coffee like beverages and also want to drink non dairy products.  

 Product Concept XXXII (HI)
Almond Breeze Yum Pot has my taste buds salivating.  A sweet creamy dessert that not only is non dairy but filled with more goodness than sugar.  Trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle can be challenging but options like this available will make it easier.

The only reservation I have of this product would come to taste.  It is called a Yum Pot, therefore I anticipate that the taste would be delicious, rich and sweet

I would certainly enjoy this after dinner, or for a late night snack or a daytime snack.  

This would be perfect for the person with an indulgent sweet tooth but conscience of their diet. 

Product Concept XXXIII (BP)

Almond Breeze Baking Mix is very inticing.  I love that this product provides more choice and options for those avoiding white flours.  I would be able to still enjoy all the recipes I used to without compromising my stomach issues.  

I hope that this baking mix is similar to other baking mixes and that the versatility is similar.  Taste and texture would be were I have reservations

I would certainly use this product to create receipes that I can enjoy for breakfast, snacks  or desserts.  I would use them to replace my regular baking

This product is for the person who is trying to use alternative products to incorporate healthier and dietary options I am not really keen on the Farm Style name.  It really implies to me that its a dairy product, so if in fact the name sticks the product must deliver the rich and creamy taste. This aspect needs to be emphasized because the idea is great.

I think the texture and taste needs to be amplified

Almond Breeze smoothie is a great concept.  I would emphasize its ingredients and nutritional goodness of all the ingredients blended to create a delicious, nutritious smoothie that can be also enjoyed on the go

The Almond Breeze Iced Coffee can be improved by providing environmentally friendly packaging.  

The idea that a ice cold frappucino like beverage with the goodness of almonds should be emphasised, all while amplify that almonds can create a delicious iced coffee

The Almond Baking Mix can be improved by adding various flavour options.  Finding alternative baking mixes with nutritional goodness is hard to find.  I would emphasis the nutritional goodness of the ingredients while emphasizing what this baking mix delivers.  

The Almond Breeze Yum pot can be improved by providing variety flavour packaging, while emphasizing it rich creamy texture and amplifing the ingredients Why I’d be interested in The Farm Style Almond Breeze Milk is that almond milks tend to be very watery.  This milk is rich, creamy and thick all reminiscent of dairy goodness without the dairy.  Pure Almonds at their finest.   Deliciousness

Concept description 

A thick, rich and creamy Almond milk that will satisfy your thirst with a almond milk like no other

ALMOND BREEZE SMOOTHIE 
Pressed for time, blending, mixing and juicing got you stressed.  All the goddness of fresh fruit and vegetables blended and packed ready to go with all the great nutrition our bodies need all combined with delicious almond milk.  

Concept description

Almond Breeze Iced Coffee

Interested in getting my caffeine fix in a cold beverage without sacrificing my diet and health choices

Concept Description 

Introducing the cold coffee beverage that will give you the caffeine fix you desire.  Made specifically with the goodness of true almonds, blended into a creamy cold frappucino like drink you get drink on the go.

ALMOND BREEZE YUM POT

I would be interested in:::   Finding healthy, guilt free desserts are difficult.  Wanting something that satisfies the sweet tooth without all the extra sugar and no guilt.  Something to enda meal with or just a treat on its own.

CONCEPT DESCRIPTION 

With California Blue Diamond Almonds blended  into a fresh delicious creamy pudding pot.  A sweet treat that not only satisfies the sweet tooth but is good for you too.  Indulge in the Yummy Pot

ALMOND BREEZE BAKING MIX

I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS because its soo difficult to find baking flour alternatives that create all the sweet and savory recipes without tasting like cardboard and sacrificing taste.

CONCEPT DESCRIPTION 

Introducing Baking Mix by Blue Diamond.  The perfect alternative to high sugary baking mixes.  Now in a plant based option.  Take your sweet treats to the next level without all the additives The Farm Style Almond milk will certainly be very versatile in my home.  From nourshing us in the morning with hot or cold cereals, to added goodness in recipes that call for milk, coffee, hot chocolate, soups, The possiblilties are endless.  This will definitely be a staple in my home

I would focus on the the versatility of the product and its calcium, vitamin and protein benefits 

ALMOND BREEZE SMOOTHIE can help nourish my family because it will provide smoothies that are mixed with various fruits and veggie options.  This would certainly be a time saver and convenient while not sacrificing the quality and goodness of the ingredients and the Almond milk. 

The position of added fruits and vegetables blended with almond milk would be the position I would focus on with the Almond Breeze smoothie

The Almond Breeze Iced Coffee is more of a nuturing product than nutritional.  Coffee always warms the soul.  This cold iced coffee nutures the soul with the added benefit of being made with Almond Milk.  I would focus on the Almond Milk and its nutritional benefit when positioning this products.

The Yum Pot is both nutritional and nuturing.  I believe we show love for our family through food.  What better way to nuture our family by providing them something sweet yet good for them.  Thats what the Yum Pot delivers, the creamy, fresh, delicous pudding without all the extra sugar.  This product can definitely replace several other products on the market specifically  because it may be healthier option.  I would position this product my highlighting the fact that it contains less sugar.

The Almond Mix Baking Mix is certainly a nourishing product that can  create delicious recipes while being a plant based product.  Nutritional and versatile, this product can create recipes that can be nuturing to my family.  From Savory to sweet, this baking mix as endless possibilities.  I believe emphasizing that this product is plant based and made from Almonds should be the position this product should take    ",Milkshake,
225811,Renee,Townsend,rtown50@sbcglobal.net,"     Concept II - Almond Breeze Matcha
1.  The natural energy boost is exciting.  It has more effect than Red Bull or coffee and it is more natural.
2.  One cup equals 10 cups of brewed green tea.  How much would be too much?  Would it keep me awake at night?
3.  I would most likely drink it early in the day to experience the concentration and energy boost and avoid it in the evening.
4.  I think it would appeal to many people as our society is so overworked and, at times, overwhelmed and could use a boost.  Everyone from executives to stay at home mothers.

Concept VI - Almond Breeze Blueberry
1.  The blueberry flavor is enticing.  This product seems to have both benefits - flavor and health benefits.  
2.  My only concern is that I don't know how the blueberry and banana flavors will mix.  It may taste good but I'd have to try it.
3.  I'd like to drink this as a breakfast addition or a in between snack.
4.  I think this would appeal to kids because of the flavor and adults for the healthy factor.

Concept X- Almond Breeze Relax
1.  The idea of comfort and relaxation is appealing.  A natural way to feel more relaxed in our stressful world.
2.  Relaxation is appealing but it sounds like a nighttime drink which would limit its use.
3.  I think it would be good at the end of a hard day or at bedtime to relax and sleep well.
4.  I think this, again, would appeal to overworked and overwhelmed individuals which would include many people.

Concept XV - Uber Breeze
1.  I like the idea of providing health benefits on the go.  It's nice to have something that you can just grab that is good for you.
2.  It's advertised as a protein shake and there are several other items on the market already that offer this benefit.  So it may need something else to make it stand out.
3.  This would be a good meal substitute when there is not a lot of time.
4.  This would benefit any busy person or children that need more nutrition and vitamins if they are not eating healthy enough.  The chocolate flavor would appeal to all.

Concept LIV - Almond Breeze Spirulina Blend
1.  The numerous health benefits draw me to this product.  8 amino acids, plant protein, vitamins and minerals - what else could you ask for.
2.  Some people may be turned off by the idea of blue-green algae because when I think of algae, I think of the gross weeds in the ocean.
3.  This could be a nice snack for anyone because I think the fruit fix would appeal to kids and adults. Concept III - Matcha
1.  The idea that should be emphasized is the natural energy boost.
2.  Concentration and energy benefits should be amplified.

Concept VI - Blueberry
1.  The fact that it is tasty and healthy should be emphasized.
2.  The health benefits should be amplified.

1.  The importance of being stress free should be emphasized.
2.  The idea of feeling comforted and relaxed should be amplified.

Concept XV - Uber Breeze
1.  The idea that you can drink it on the go should be emphasized.
2.  Protein filled and tasty as a shake - that should be amplified.

Concept LIV - Spirulina
1.  The various minerals, vitamins, amino acids - the health benefit should be emphasized.
2.  The fruit fix of kiwi, banana, apple and orange could be amplified. Concept II - Matcha
C - Life gets busy and sometimes I need a little energy boost.  I love that Matcha is natural.
D - Sometimes we wish there were more hours in the day.  This drink will provide you with the extra boost in concentration and give you that extra bit of energy to keep going.  All the nutrition of brewed green tea and naturally fiber and vitamin rich.  Go green.

Concept VI - Blueberry
C - The perfect match - great taste and healthy.
D - Not often does something that is good for you also taste good.  All the natural benefits of blueberries and bananas  and their delicious flavor in one drink.  Satisfying and Healthy.

Concept X - Relax
C - Restore your health and put more joy in your life.

1.  This product can give you the natural energy and concentration boost that will help you be the best you can be.  You need to be alert and attentive to your family.
2.  Vitamins, fiber, detoxification

Concept VI - Blueberry
1.  I like to make sure my family is healthy but I need to offer them something that tastes good too.
2.  Natural blueberry and banana flavors that provide fiber, potassium, folate and vitamin C.

Concept X - Relax
1.  It's difficult to nurture others if I'm feeling stressed or pressured.  When I'm relaxed, it benefits my family and helps my life run smoother.
2.  The infusion of camomile extract, lavender and lemon all help keep me calm and relaxed.

Concept XV - Uber Breeze
1.  Sometimes I don't have time to make a healthy, nutritious meal.  With everyone's busy schedule, it's great to know there's something I can offer my family when we're rushed or in a hurry.
2.  This drink contains fiber, vitamins, and protein that can replace a meal if necessary.

Concept LIV - Spirulina Blend
1.  Nutrition is important to keep everyone as healthy as they can.  This is one way to ensure it without having to take numerous vitamins.
2.  This drink is packed with vitamins and minerals, protein and amino acids plus a pleasant fruity flavor.",Milkshake,
234995,Emily,Bache,emily@thewanderlustgirls.com,"     Almond Breeze Turmeric: I love that this has medicinal properties. The sole fact that it incorporates a product that has anti cancer properties is incredible. Enough to draw me in on that solely. I think the taste would not be great. I'm not sure if the tastes would compliment each other. I would eat it in the morning mostly. I usually have anything that has nutrients I need or vitamins in the morning. I also think milk is associated with breakfast. I think this would appeal to someone 25-35 who is conscious of what they put in their body. I also think people above 55 would be interested as well. 

Almond Breeze Botanical: Hibiscus is so great for you. The fact that it has anti-inflammatory effects is great. I also like that it helps with digestion because that is a negative thing I associate with milk. Even though it is not cows milk it still gets the negative connotation. I also LOVE the flavor of hibiscus, so that would be delicious. I would be nervous that it would taste weird associated with almond milk. I would maybe incorporate this into a smoothie, so I would have it in the morning. I think this would be a gym goer in their 30's. 

Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion: I think this would add a lot of flavor, which would be great for a product that is known to be mixed with other products for flavor. This could be something you could drink on it's own or incorporate into morning coffee. I would definitely like to drink this when I felt I was getting sick. It may be thought of as something you only drink when you are sick though because of association with those ingredients. It may be pigeon holed into a natural remedy for sickness, which may not be a bad thing. A young health conscious person would take this when they felt they were getting sick. 

Almond Breeze Settler: This sounds right up my alley. I'm always sick and it would be great to have a drink that I felt was going to settle my stomach rather than just ginger ale. My reservation would be that it would only be used for settling a stomach rather than in an everyday routine. I would drink this if my stomach wasn't feeling great or my digestion was off. I think an elderly person would drink this. 

Uber Breeze: I love that these are on the go. I'm always running out the door and it would be better to grab something that is good for me on a nutritional level than just a soda. It's a great size as well. It can fit in your purse. It reminds me of protein shakes or boost, which would pigeon hole it as well. I would eat this in the morning as I was running out the door. I could see my dad drinking this. Almond Breeze Settler: I think it needs to be sold as not something you have everyday, but something that is sure to settler your stomach when you drink it. Really give it all the things it would need to settle a stomach. 
Could something like ginger be added as well to really make sure it would be a stomach settler? Really give it an extra boost of what it does? Maybe charcoal of some sort? That is really popular these days. 

Uber Breeze: The fact that it is on the go is the most exciting part about this. The fact that it is a meal replacement is so great. That is something I would want to be more visible in the packaging because that is what I would use it for, to replace breakfast.  

Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infused: The taste is something that is unique to milk, so I would emphasize that. Rather than talk about the ""when you're feeling low"" I would discuss more its medicinal properties.

Almond Breeze Botanical: The health benefits are the most exciting about this product. That should be very clear on the packaging and in the wording. I would want to see that it lowered my cholesterol was anti-inflamatory etc on the package. 

Almond Breeze Turmeric: I love everything about this bottle. The packaging the label everything is great! I would maybe add what the health benefits are on the back or something. Almond Breeze Turmeric: Introducing Turmeric by Blue Diamond, an exciting new way to incorporate turmeric into your daily routine. Enjoy the flavor as well as medicinal benefits including anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. 

Uber Breeze: Introducing Uber Breeze by Blue Diamond, an easy on the go meal replacement. Of course you've got almonds, but we've also provided fibers, vitamins, proteins and nutrients that you need to get you through a hectic day! 

Almond Breeze Botanical: Introducing Botanical by Blue Diamond, a delicious drink to help lower cholesterol, improve digestion as well as containing anti-inflammatory properties. Don't forget the benefits of almonds! 

Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infused: Introducing Ginger & Honey Infusion by Blue Diamond. Enjoy the medicinal benefits of ginger (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and digestion) combined with the soothing benefits of honey. Did we mention it tastes delicious? 

Almond Breeze Settler: Upset stomach? Introducing Settler by Blue Diamond with calcium, live cultures and fiber proven to aid in digestion. Plus, you get the health benefits from our delicious almond base. 

**I like the idea of making it more conversational. Like the brand is talking to the consumer. Almond Breeze Botanical: This is something I would incorporate into a smoothie for my family every morning. A great start to the day with great health benefits. The anti-inflammatory properties and improved digestion helps. I remember as a kid my brother would wake up every morning with some ailment. It would be great to start each child with a health boost in the morning. 
 
Almond Breeze Turmeric: This is something I would have everyone drink everyday as a preventative. Cancer is a scary thing and people are trying to be more conscious of what we ingest that could prevent a disease. This is something I would incorporate as a drink they would have straight or in a smoothie. 

Uber Breeze: The fact that is a meal replacement and has everything a meal would provide nutritionally is the important factor here. I could see giving this to everyone in the family as we are running out the door to my neices soccer game. 

Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infused: This would be something again incorporating in a smoothie or in coffee every morning, especially when sick. The medicinal ginger properties is what I would highlight as well as the soothing honey. 

Almond Breeze Settler: If a kid comes home from school sick or someone has  a stomach ache this is where I see this coming into play. I would drink this as is and highlight the fact that it truly can settle a stomach ache and aid in digestion.",Milkshake,
252375,Michelle,Hopper,michellehopper1981@gmail.com,"Start Choice 1
Almond Breeze Farm-Style

1. The most exciting part of this product is the extra thick and creamy recipe. My children prefer their milk to be thick and rich. This would be great for cooking and baking as well.
2.My only reservation about developing this product would be, what would they be using to create the thickness. So long as its a natural ingredient, I'd be ok with that.
3. My children drink milk daily in their morning cereals, we cook soup from scratch, we bake often with recipes calling for butter milk, I presume it could be a great option. 
4. Bakers, soup lovers, anyone who loves milk!

Choice 2
Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
1. I like the fact that I think I am getting a treat (Candybar) but its loaded with goodness. We often buy high protein bars but they all end up being full of refined sugars. This would be a great replacement.
2. no reservations about this one.
3. This would be an afternoon pick me up type snack for out and on the go for our family. Throw it in your bag for the day and its ready when you want it!
4. Busy people, parents, teachers (great to have a quick bite during recess)

Choice 3
Almond Breeze Pouches
1. My kids would LOVE to be able to have juice in their lunch packs. (they never get them as they are loaded with sugar) 
2. Again, only reservations would be to know about the ingredients going into the them
3. If affordable, we would send them in the kids lunches daily, otherwise  a few times a week. 
4. Parents! People who choose to purchase nonsugared beverages.

Choice 4

1. Quick, Easy and Tasty nutrition when in a bind!

Almond Breeze Kids Complete
1. Extra nutrition, Super food option for my kids!

225815,Shirley,Zhu,shirley.jpg@gmail.com,"     A. Concept XV (Uber Breeze)
1. This product is exciting to me because I feel that nutrition-in-one products are made with consumers like me in mind. I am always on the go, commuting around the city -- it's hard to find time to eat, and an on-the-go meal is a must. As someone who works out regularly, I *love* a product that has a great protein offering, and this is a very appealing option to me. 
2. As is the case with most products like this, I would be a little wary of the sugar content per serving. If the sugar level can be kept down, I'd be pretty satisfied. 
3. I would likely have this for breakfast on the way to work or as a snack an hour or two before going to the gym. 
4. I think this would appeal to commuters on the go, busy and health-conscious adults in their 20s-30s.

B. Concept XLII (Almond Breeze Oatmilk Blend)
1. I like this product because I feel that it would make a great base for smoothies and shakes. I usually use soy milk and this new product appears to have more to offer on a nutritional level (fiber, less sugar).  
2. Again, I would be a little wary of the sugar in each serving. I would also be curious as to what this tastes like, but this is a very minor concern. 
3. I would have this on weekends when I'm making bowls and smoothies for meals/snacks. I would consume this in oatmeal on weekday mornings. 
4. I think this product will appeal to anyone who is lactose intolerant, vegan, or health conscious. It looks like a great dairy substitute. 

C. Concept LIV (Almond Breeze Spirulina Blend)
1. I like this product because it looks like another great on-the-go meal/snack. The bottled juice product is very popular with young working adults, and I love the idea of Almond Breeze contributing to the ecosystem. As stated earlier, I try to lead an active lifestyle and I love protein drinks.
2. I would wonder what the spirulina tastes like within the context of this drink. I am familiar with the taste of spirulina and know that it can be an acquired taste when paired with different ingredients. 
3. I would likely have this as a snack when I'm running out the door to run errands. I would also likely have this as a quick in-between-meals snack at work if I don't have time to eat lunch. 
4. I think this product will also appeal to anyone who is lactose intolerant, vegan, or health conscious. I think this product has great potential with active young adults who work out and want a good source of protein. 

D. Concept XIV (Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative)
1. I like this product because I grew up consuming condensed milk, and the idea of there being an alternative to the super sweet version is very intriguing to me. Throughout my life, I consumed it in coffee, in pastries, and also in sandwich form (condensed milk sandwiches). I would be very interested in trying a gamechanger like this, even if I'm pretty loyal to the real thing.  
2. I'm almost certain that anybody who grew up consuming condensed milk would worry that this product doesn't measure up in flavor. It is a risky product in the sense that people buy condensed milk with their expectations in place. An alternative condensed milk product might not be well-received regardless of objective quality if these expectations are rigid.  
3. I would likely have this casually with coffee, and I would love to run baking/cooking experiments with it. 
4. I think this product would appeal to health-conscious longtime consumers of condensed milk. Since real condensed milk is incredibly high in sugar and calories, it's possible that this product would appeal to people who already know what to expect and are looking for healthier alternatives. 

E. Concept IX (Almond Breeze Settler)
1. I like this product because I love drinking kefir and this looks like a great alternative product to try. I am also a dedicated yogurt consumer, and seeing portable probiotic products appeals greatly to me. 
2. I don't really have reservations about this product. I would perhaps want to read the back for nutritional value info, but the identity of the product is pretty straightforward, in my opinion. 
3. I would definitely have this product in the morning when I'm running off to work. 
4. This product would appeal most to health conscious people, and to people who likely already consume yogurt. As probiotic food products continue to rise in popularity, I think this product has great potential to appeal to many more consumers if the proper health/wellness-centric marketing were applied. A. Concept XV (Uber Breeze)
Meal replacement products tend to have suspect ingredients, so the idea of a plant/almond-based protein shake sounds very exciting. The natural (as opposed to chemical) aspects of this product should be emphasized. Amplifying the protein and fiber benefits would be great. Marketing this as an ""anytime"" product -- this is perfect for after the gym, a quick breakfast, etc. 

B. Concept XLII (Almond Breeze Oatmilk Blend)
What's great about this product is that it's a perfect milk base for plenty of foods, but it has a little extra to it from the oatmilk, which gives it a special angle and sets it apart from other milk products that seem plain in comparison. The protein and soluble fiber aspects are great -- the holistic gut health aspect is very important to highlight. 

C. Concept LIV (Almond Breeze Spirulina Blend)
Highlighting the product's gluten-free, plant-based, and natural aspects can be emphasized, as these are highly desirable among the target demographic who would gravitate toward a product like this. I would emphasize the way that this product hits macronutrients -- I think a lot of people look for numbers when considering protein-rich foods. 

D. Concept XIV (Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative)
This product is a bit of a gamechanger, in my opinion. Marketing this as a dairy-free, lower calorie/sugar, vegan-friendly alternative would be a good move, as I feel that the market for this type of product is rather small. 

E. Concept IX (Almond Breeze Settler)
This product deals with a conventionally unsexy topic, so I like that it leans toward the messaging of balance. I think the soothing aspect should be played up -- the product should be bringing its ""restorative"" benefits to consumers. 1. Concept XV (Uber Breeze)
C. I am often commuting around, and I don't have many nutritious options for on-the-go meals. I need a shortcut solution that is readily available, nutritious, and natural. I don't want to compromise health for convenience.
D. Introducing Uber Breeze by Blue Diamond, the perfect drink for those on the move. It's a filling drink packed with all the goodness of almonds, and rich with a meal's worth of fibers, vitamins, plant-based proteins, and nutrients in a convenient recyclable container that you can take anywhere.

2. Concept XLII (Almond Breeze Oatmilk Blend)
C. I want to feel good and balanced, and it’s important that I get my fill of quality macronutrients and support my gut health. I am busy and don't want to go out of way to achieve this with specialty products, and I want to make sure that I achieve this through natural foods.
D. Introducing Almondmilk blended with oatmilk by Blue Diamond, which provides high quality protein, carbohydrates and beta-glucagens to amp up soluble fiber, supporting digestion and restoring balance in the body.

3. Concept LIV (Almond Breeze Spirulina Blend)
C. I look for straightforward and natural ways to ensure I get as many important macronutrients as I can throughout the day. I'm especially wary of the times that I'm hungry for a snack and prone to eating unhealthily.
D. Spirulina Blend by Blue Diamond will keep you going through the slowest parts of the day. With its vibrant hue, spirulina is a blue-green algae which is very high in protein. Spirulina is a unique, plant-based protein that contains all 8 essential amino acids, as well as large quantities of vitamins and minerals. 

4. Concept XIV (Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative)
C. Condensed milk is a uniquely delicious sweetener that I use in coffee and baking. Finding a dairy-free condensed milk alternative that is as equally delicious and creamy is a pretty tall order.
D. Introducing Condensed Milk Alternative by Blue Diamond, a gamechanging plant-based alternative to regular, high-caloric condensed milks. This new almond-based condensed milk alternative is vegan-friendly and healthier, and won’t compromise on adding body and a smooth finish to your drink or meal.

5. Concept IX (Almond Breeze Settler)
C. I think sustaining a healthy gut flora is essential to a balanced diet, especially given my occasional indulgences that leave my stomach in a state of discontent. To relieve this state of disrepair, I’d love an all-natural drink that can soothe and restore.
D. Introducing Settler by Blue Diamond, the perfect drink to calm your senses. This calcium, fiber, and live culture-filled drink provides digestive relief that will restore balance to your system. 1. Concept XV (Uber Breeze)
This product can nourish adults on the go. Busy working adults may tend to neglect key aspects of self care, and nutrition is a big one. This product can ensure that proper nutrients -- protein, fiber, healthy carbs -- are consumed for at least one serving. Positioning this product as something that busy people can use to take a little bit of time to enjoy/care for themselves might be an option.   

2. Concept XLII (Almond Breeze Oatmilk Blend)
This is a household-friendly product that provides nourishment throughout the day, and in a variety of ways, given milk's capacity to be consumed on its own and along with different foods. Consider positioning this as a product that is versatile, friendly to all ages, and milk with a little something extra special.

3. Concept LIV (Almond Breeze Spirulina Blend)
I see this product as something that can provide nourishment within the context of a snack. Hunger can motivate one to indulge unhealthily, and this product can be a healthy and all-natural alternative to consider, with its nutrient-rich offerings (amino acids, protein, etc.). 

4. Concept XIV (Almond Breeze Condensed Milk Alternative)
I see this product as a family-friendly sweetener that can be nurturing in an enjoyment sense. Anyone can use this as an alternative to standard condensed milk and know that it will be delicious and comparatively healthier -- a comparison of the ingredients lists alone would prove this, and that should give everyone the reassurance that their family members are consuming a better product. 

5. Concept IX (Almond Breeze Settler)
This product is a nurturing product that can provide relief and also help restore the digestive system's natural balance. I think of this product as a product for adults who are health-conscious, and aware of the digestive system and the importance of its maintenance. I would highlight its calming capabilities, the all-natural aspect of its ingredient list, and the nourished/nurtured way that one would feel *after* consumption.",Milkshake,INFJ
225813,Rene,Diaz,renesandy@gmail.com,"Start To be honest the only one that truly got me excited was Almond Breeze Iced Coffee:
1. I used to be a big fan of the Starbucks iced coffee until milk became a big no-no, to have an almond milk alternative would be amazing, if taste is right. 
2. Taste - Unsure how almond milk would translate to that rich, creamy flavor I was used to. 
3. Mornings or afternoon pick me up, definitely. 
4. On the go individuals with somewhat disposable income to invest in coffee outside of the home. 

In no particular order:

Almond Breeze Probiotics Plus
1. Reminds me of Keefer, Activia, etc. The fact that it promotes good digestive health is crucial to me since I tend to not lead the best digestive diet. 
2. Taste - Unsure how it would taste. 
3. Probably before bed to promote overnight digestive health.
4. Individuals looking for benefits of digestive-health products without the harshness of dairy. 

Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
1. Yogurt coated! Hoping for a good taste. 
2. Taste - Unsure how it will translate and what exactly plant-based means, which plants exactly?
3. On-the go, or as a breakfast bar along with yogurt or afternoon snack to hold me over for dinner. 
4. On-the-go individuals looking for a fix to hold them over.

2. Caloric and sugar content.

4. Individuals on the go looking for a tasty snack. 

Almond Breeze Whole Milk
1. Actual whole milk, instead of that watery consistency of dairy alternatives
2. Taste
3. Cereal, with coffee, etc. 
4. Someone looking for the goodness/richness of milk without the side effects of dairy. Almond Breeze Iced Coffee:
I think the number one thing here is that it reminds me of the Starbucks iced-coffee. Maybe a brand collaboration? I also think what drew me most was DAIRY-FREE, definitely should be amplified. Perhaps also different flavors. 

Almond Breeze Probiotics Plus
I would include the amount of cultures in each serving, I think this is crucial on all these probiotic drinks.

I'm unsure, aside from not having milk and all the new controversy surrounding milk and possible health dangers. 
I think for this product its hard to posit it as nourishment, since its more for personal enjoyment.

Whole milk:
If there are some added nutrients of almondmilk over regular milk, or some benefits of foregoing regular milk aside from digestive health for non-dairy tolerants, I think these should be highlighted. 

Smoothie:
Unsure, really, because I'm sure it might be a sugary product. Maybe it can be infused with chia seeds or some type of ""healthy"" seed.

Probiotic:
Among my chosen concepts this is the one that has the most benefits, to me. The promotion of digestive health and the overall nutritional benefits is something to be highlighted. 

Bar:
Also healthy, I think further information about what exactly comprises it, flax seed, chia seeds, oats, etc., and how they are beneficial for overall health.    ",Milkshake,
225787,Amanda,Johnston,johnston.amandalynn@gmail.com,"Start Product Concept XVI (ABX) A. Name: Almond Breeze Farm-Style
1. What excites you most about this product? Why? 
I’m excited about the prospect of a thick and creamy non-dairy milk. Although current non-dairy milks do a great job of replacing regular milk in cereal and baking, I miss being able to have a glass of milk with cookies or just as a drink. Almond milk consistency is currently more like drinking skim milk, which I find wholly unsatisfying.
2. What reservations do you have about this product? Why? 
I think there’s a risk in calling it farm-style when we’re not involving the cow. I would also like to know what “good nutrients” are packed in there.
3. What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product? 
I would drink a glass of milk with sweet desserts like Oreos or cake. I may add it to my tea or use it to make an extra-thick smoothie, possibly necessitating less yogurt. Occasionally, I’d just drink a cold glass of milk to be refreshed. The latter would be kind of nostalgic for me because I drank milk as a kid.
4. Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?
I think it might appeal to people who are hesitant to drink non-dairy milk or give it to their children. There is a richness and thickness missing from non-dairy offerings. Perhaps this would bridge the taste and consistency gap.

Product Concept XXI (MM) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
1. What excites you most about this product? Why? 
I love snack bars! I travel around a lot during the day, and snack bars are often a good energy boost that can curb my hunger when I don’t have the availability to eat lunch on time. This one sounds exciting too because it’s fruit flavored. Fruit flavors are harder to find in the snack bar world, especially if you want to keep it healthy.
2. What reservations do you have about this product? Why? 
I’m always a little concerned about the shelf life of products with “yoghurt”. Yoghurt seems like something that shouldn’t be left out of the fridge.
3. What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product? 
When I’m on the go or at work. I think it would be a good snack during a hike or long drive, and a good thing to pack in my lunchbox.
4. Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?
Probably healthy, active people or people who like to snack. I really think these types of things are handy for working people or students who pack their lunch. It’s always nice to have a snack on hand.

Product Concept XXXII (HI) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yum Pot
1. What excites you most about this product? Why? 
Dessert is an important part of mealtime for me. I often just want a little something sweet that isn’t going to bring me closer to the grave. I like the idea of a product that’s light and delicious but not branded and created as a “light” product. For example, a bowl of fruit with whipped cream is more enticing to me than low-sugar candies.
2. What reservations do you have about this product? Why? 
I’d like to know how much it tastes like almonds and how much it tastes like the flavor. What flavours would be offered?
3. What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product? 
After supper or as a quick snack when I arrived home from work. (Sometimes I have dessert first.)
4. Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?
People who want to enjoy the good things in life but don’t want to spend all of their time making those things. I think this would appeal to people who often find themselves reaching for snacks but want a healthier option that’s still satisfying. For example, sometimes I just want a quick bite of sweet, but I have only fattening options with no size regulation (think tubs of ice cream). So, I end up overeating unhealthy foods for lack of a better option.

Product Concept XXXVII (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
1. What excites you most about this product? Why? 
My family and I use ranch often, on salads and as a dip. However, most dressings are extremely unhealthy. I would like a healthier, lower-calorie option. Plus, we try to keep animal products out of our diet as much as possible.
2. What reservations do you have about this product? Why? 
I wonder about the taste and the consistency. Ranch needs to be rather thick, which may be hard to accomplish without buttermilk or a heavier base.
3. What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product? 
I would use it on salad and as a dipping sauce for buffalo cauliflower, jalapeño poppers, etc. It would often be part of dinner or served with sides at sports viewing parties.
4. Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?
Someone who likes dressing but has been forced to buy low fat options or skip dressing altogether due to calorie count. If vegan, you would add that group as well. However, lovers of general ranch dressing would have to be convinced to switch brands. Some people I know (especially in the Midwest) take their ranch very seriously, sometimes buying containers of it from specific restaurants to go on food they purchased somewhere else.

Product Concept XLI (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Pasta Sauce
1. What excites you most about this product? Why? 
Well, I don’t eat chicken, but I do eat a considerable amount of pasta and vegetables. It’s extremely difficult to find vegetarian sauces. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find creamy sauces without high milk content. We have to get extremely creative with sauces in our house due to vegetarian and lactose intolerant family members. We have to make almost every sauce from scratch, which is time consuming and sometimes convinces us to skip the sauce altogether and just eat things plain. I like the idea of a quick, healthy, creamy sauce we all can share. It could add some excitement to our boring meals.
2. What reservations do you have about this product? Why? 
I would want it to have basic, unsuspicious ingredients and be dairy-free as well as vegetarian. Sometimes I read the ingredients in sauces or sauce packets and feel horrified by what I could have eaten. Some ingredients I can’t even pronounce. If I can’t pronounce it, I don’t want it going in my body.
3. What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product? 
I would use this primarily at dinner, on pastas or green beans or perhaps in casseroles. Hopefully it would heat up well for leftovers, too.
4. Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?
Someone who regularly cooks dinner but has a limited amount of time to do so. Product Concept XVI (ABX) A. Name: Almond Breeze Farm-Style
I would emphasize the thick and creamy aspect and further define “nutrients”. I would probably nix the “one of the” phrasing; that makes it sound less exciting. I like “rich beverage” and no shortcuts, and think those should remain.

Product Concept XXI (MM) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
This is really more of a product description than a concept. It’s very factual. While that’s important, I would also focus a bit more on the snack being “supercharged” with goodness and speak more to what it delivers to the consumer. The concept should present WHY this is a great snack bar, not just tell me WHAT it is.

Product Concept XXXII (HI) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yum Pot
I like the anywhere/anytime aspect and would definitely keep that and possibly emphasize it more. I would like to see more focus on the natural aspect of the product. Right now it’s limited to “California grown” and “fresh”. We may want to discuss taste more as well. All we have is “delicious” and “creamy”.

Product Concept XXXVII (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
I’m not sure why we’re saying “From the makers of Almond Breeze”. I guess I’m not too particular about buying milk and dressing from the same company. Emphasizing the healthier alternative (low calorie) aspect could also be beneficial here. I guess I like that we’re saying how to use it because that equates it to ""regular ranch"" (for lack of a better term), but I don’t think that needs to be called out so much—most people know how to use ranch dressing. 

Product Concept XLI (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Pasta Sauce
Do we need to specify chicken or pasta? I would like to use it for other things too, or at least allow consumers to consider some other ideas. Also, that doesn’t align super well with “protein or veggies”. Dairy free is very important to me as is ""healthy"". I would also emphasize the time savings more while mentioning the uncompromised taste and quality. Product Concept XVI (ABX) A. Name: Almond Breeze Farm-Style
I would leave part C as is. 
Part D revision:
Introducing Farm-Style Almond Breeze by Blue Diamond, a richly thick and creamy non-dairy almond milk packed with [nutrients] that will keep your family healthy and happy.

Product Concept XXI (MM) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
Part C: I have a lot on my plate and my busy schedule doesn’t always allow time for healthy snacks. I need something I can grab fast that fills me up but keeps me going and provides the essential nutrients I need. 
Part D:
Introducing Yogurt Coated Bar by Blue Diamond, an almond-based supercharged snack packed with fruit-flavored goodness. This soft baked bar uses natural, plant-based ingredients to give you a dose of healthy energy while you’re on the go.

Product Concept XXXII (HI) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yum Pot
Part C: OK as is
Part D:
Introducing Yum Pot by Blue Diamond, a non-dairy pudding you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. Made with California almonds, this deliciously creamy but light dessert will please your palate without breaking calorie count.

Product Concept XXXVII (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
Part C: I always find myself dipping my nutrient-rich vegetables in fattening dressings. If I could find a healthy, dairy-free dressing that didn’t compromise on taste, my good-for-me meals would be great again.
Part D:
Introducing Blue Diamond Ranch Dressing. This deliciously creamy dressing brings rich new flavor to your salads and sides without using dairy ingredients. Keep the quality, leave the calories, and enjoy every meal.

Product Concept XLI (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Pasta Sauce
Part C: I don’t always have the energy to cook up a nice dinner from scratch. Quick and healthy meal solutions save me in those moments and keep the whole family happy.
Part D:
Introducing Pasta Sauce by Blue Diamond, a creamy, dairy-free cooking sauce for all your favorite meals. Take your time back with this tasty, healthy garnish that’s ready to go when you are. Product Concept XVI (ABX) A. Name: Almond Breeze Farm-Style
1. Farm-Style Almond Breeze would help my family grow and stay strong with hearty taste and essential nutrients. It would add nutritional value to our meals.
2. I think you need to specify the key nutrients and benefits growing kids and adults would enjoy by drinking this almond milk. How comparable is it to milk from the cow? Does it hold more nutritional value than other almond milks? The ""farm"" part of the name also alludes to its natural origins, which is a good selling point you may want to emphasize as well. 

Product Concept XXI (MM) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yogurt Coated Bar
1. This snack bar could bring me the healthy calories and vitamins I need to keep up an active lifestyle.
2. I like the word supercharged. It could be valuable to focus on how this snack bar gives you energy without the bad fats or sugars found in similar options. Also, I often see “baked” used to describe healthier options for potato chips, but that may be worthwhile to point out for this product if similar options are produced in a way that yields fewer health benefits. I would also mention the lifestyle aspect for this one. It’s good for families or moms on the go who need healthy snacks they can trust but don’t have a lot of free time to make them.


Product Concept XXXII (HI) A. Name: Almond Breeze Yum Pot
1. Healthy snacks bring happiness into the home and daily life. Yum pots sound great because kids can grab them on their own, and parents don't have to worry about the negative effects of their kids having dessert. I'd much rather have the kids grab for something like this than watch boxes of sugar-rolled and chocolate dipped cookies disappear.
2. There are health benefits to using almonds as a base, so you may want to call attention to the healthy ingredients. But mostly I would focus on how this puts you in a great state of mind. It can bring a smile to your face. Often the foods we enjoy come with a sense of concern about our health or the health of our family. This one should be all about easing your worries because you’re getting healthy and happy together.

Product Concept XXXVII (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Ranch Dressing
1. We use ranch dressing often at our house. Since it can become a part of any meal, or even a snack, it’s important to me that we’re enjoying the healthiest option. Not to mention we have a lactose intolerant, a vegetarian and a vegan family member, so I love finding healthy, tasty options the whole family can enjoy. This could replace the dressings I worry about without compromising taste.
2. I’d point out that it has fewer calories than other options because dressing is very fattening. The non-dairy option is also important to many people these days. I think it’s even worthwhile to point out some of the healthy meal options we douse with dressing; show how those meals can be made both healthy and enjoyable by replacing other dressings with this one.


Product Concept XLI (DE) A. Name: Almond Breeze Pasta Sauce
1. Vegetarian sauces are extremely difficult to find, but they are so much healthier and less fatty than meat-based sauces. Having the option to easily make meals delicious with a plant-based sauce is a real game changer. It keeps my family healthier without making them upset about poor taste.
2. I would definitely call out dairy-free and plant-based. However, taste/consistency is an important part of this conversation because the only real reason to use sauces is to improve taste. They’re not a whole meal on their own. I’d also pitch the time savings, as many people I know are pressed for time and would rather spend time with their families than standing over the stove. While time may have nothing to do with nutrients, time together can nourish your relationships.    ",Milkshake,
198777,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"     1.	Almond Breeze Cinnamon

What excites you most about this product? Why?

Whenever I’ve done a juice cleanse (sorry), they usually include one “nut milk” and it’s always the most delicious part of the experience. The ingredients in this seem like they’re the same.

What reservations do you have about this product? Why?

None. I just hope it’s delicious. 

What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product?

After workouts, as a dessert drink, pretty much all the time. 

Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?

A person looking for healthy or dairy alternative beverages that are delicious. 

2.	Almond Breeze Lassi
What excites you most about this product? Why?

I do love lassi but I don’t have much occasion to drink it outside of Indian food restaurants, mostly because I’m not sure where I would buy it.

What reservations do you have about this product? Why?

I would just hope that it approaches the same thickness that a dairy-based lassi achieves. Thin lassi would be kind of a bummer.

What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product?

Hot days, special occasions, post-workout.

Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?

More adventurous eaters who actually know what lassi is. 

3.	Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt

What excites you most about this product? Why?

It just sounds like it would be tasty – kind of a cold chocolate milk. 

What reservations do you have about this product? Why?

It might taste like Yoo-hoo if done improperly. I hope the end result doesn’t actually have any added sugar. 

What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product?

To be honest, I would drink this all the time. All of these drinks are great because I don’t drink alcohol and consider myself health-conscious, so I’m always looking for new types of drinks that don’t have a bunch of added sugar in them. 

Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?

Health-conscious people, busy people, parents looking for milk alternatives for their kids. 

4.	Uber Breeze

What excites you most about this product? Why?

I drink tons of stuff like this (plant-based protein drinks), so I would be insanely happy to see another brand available that may be more tasty, have less ingredients or offer a lower price point. 

What reservations do you have about this product? Why?

Nothing. I just need it to taste (pretty) good.

What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product?

Post-workout, pre-workout, late afternoon. I’m always in need of more protein. 

Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?

Athletes, busy people, health-conscious. Everybody should get into drinks like this .

5.	Almond Breeze Banana Blend

What excites you most about this product? Why?

Pretty much what the write-up says: I love almond milk. I love bananas. If this is a delicious drink, I’m all for it. ALSO: could be a game-changer for cereal. 

What reservations do you have about this product? Why?

I don’t know that I’ve ever had banana milk (outside of a smoothie) so I’m not sure I would necessarily like it. 

What occasions would you most likely eat or drink the product?

Breakfast!

Who or what type of person would this product appeal to most?

Cereal connoisseurs. Adventurous eaters. Almond Breeze Cinnamon

1.	What things that excite you about the idea could be emphasized? 

I would take pains to emphasize that the product is made out of simple ingredients, and with no added sugar. 

2.	What product benefits could be amplified?

Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. People hate oxidants.

Almond Breeze Lassi

1.	What things that excite you about the idea could be emphasized? 

I think people need to be taught what lassi is. My fear is that most people don’t know, so really sell what the product is on the packaging.  

2.	What product benefits could be amplified?

“The creamy, delicious lassi that you love with a plant-based twist!”


Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt

1.	What things that excite you about the idea could be emphasized? 

Emphasize the fact that this is probably going to be delicious, like chocolate milk but good(ish) for you!  

2.	What product benefits could be amplified?

Again, the minimal ingredients would be a big sell for me, especially when I’m choosing between this product and another with lots of added sugar when my preschool age daughter asks for a drink.


Uber Breeze

1.	What things that excite you about the idea could be emphasized? 

I’m not sure how much awareness there is around this kind of plant-based protein drinks, but the idea as it’s being sold here is basically the same as the other two or three I normally go to (Evolve, Orgain). Both of those taste pretty decent (Orgain being the best,) but I would try and sell the taste as almond-forward to distinguish it, if not just doing your best to sell the time you’ve put into making it delicious. When people who work out a lot reach for a quick protein source, we’ve kind of come to expect that taste might be kind of secondary. 

2.	What product benefits could be amplified?

Definitely protein, at least 20g, along with low sugar and high fiber. If there’s a way to sweeten with dates or raisins or something, all the better.

Almond Breeze Banana Blend

1.	What things that excite you about the idea could be emphasized? 

The idea that this could be marketed specifically as a cereal accoutrement. “Cereal’s new best friend.”

2.	What product benefits could be amplified?

If you’re drinking some kind of alternative milk, it would be nice if it’s fortified with the kind of nutrients you get in cow’s milk. Here, it would be great if the banana blend came loaded with both calcium and potassium. Please rewrite the concept description in a way that would make the product most appealing to you.

2. What are the important points that will position each product as one that might provide nourishment?

Almond Breeze Cinnamon

1.	I see this as a drink both my daughter and I can get behind as a reasonably low-sugar alternative to chocolate milk.
2.	Antioxidant power and anti-inflammatory power!

Almond Breeze Lassi

1.	Could be a good dessert-type drink and/or morning smoothie alternative. 
2.	Vitamin-rich, exotic MANGO is always a welcome addition to the standard fruit intake around the house. 

Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate & Sea Salt

1.	This is ultimately a very similar sell to the Almond Breeze Cinnamon beverage, but it could be a good choice as a simple sweet treat made with only whole, unprocessed foods.
2.	“Contains X% of your daily calcium, magnesium and healthy sodium requirements!”

Uber Breeze 

1.	My wife and I will usually grab a packaged plant-based protein drink on our way out of the house in the morning if we don’t have the time or inclination to make a smoothie. 
2.	“A healthy and plant-based source of protein that tastes AMAZING!”

Almond Breeze Banana Blend

1.	If this particular combo has less sugar than a cup of milk and a banana, but with the same nutrients, I can see it being an easy substitution. 
2.	“A delicious source of potassium to change your breakfast game!”",Milkshake,
198809,Sandy,Kane,madamekane@yahoo.com,"     This was a difficult task, as so many of these look healthy, delicious and different. However, I have narrowed down my top five product choices:

Concept IV (QW) Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion:
1) Likes - I'm excited about this because ginger and honey are two of my favorite flavors (alone and even better, combined), and they are naturally good for the body. I love the idea of this being a comforting, boosting addition to my diet. I'd totally buy this product. 
2) Reservations - none really, but a taste/sample size would provide consumers a way to decide for themselves if this is right for them. Some may be disinclined to purchase a full-size product without trying first.
3) Occasions - many! Breakfast, lunch or mid-afternoon slump snack time.
4) Appeal - those who care about naturally healthy alternatives; parents; adventurers.

Concept V (QW): Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate + Sea Salt: 
1) Likes - I absolutely love this product idea. I'm a huge vanilla and chocolate fan. Often can't decide between the two, so end up having both! The best of both worlds. Plus it looks healthy with natural vitamins and minerals, a total plus. 
2) Reservations - none to speak of. I think a product with these flavors will fly off shelves! People counting calories might be looking at the label before buying? Likely there is not a lot of fat in a product like this.
3) Occations - many: breakfast, lunch, mid-afternoon slump snack time, even dessert time if the taste is sweet.
4) Appeal - young and old; health-conscious; parents

Concept VII (QW) Almond Breeze Lassi:
1) Likes - Love this product idea. LOVE mangos and the idea of combining almond milk with mango is genius! Vitamins are a plus. This is a terrific product idea and I hope it makes the final grade!
2) Reservations - none really for me. Those concerned about added sugar or calories might hesitate to purchase, tho.
3) Occasions - breakfast, with lunch, mid-afternoon slump snack time, dessert alternative - and something healthy to bring on a long road trip
4) Appeal - just about everyone who likes mango - health-conscious folks, parents, lactose-intolerant people etc

Concept XLVI (HPH) Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate:
1) Likes - Wow, i love this idea a lot. Mexican hot choco is a great, warming, decadent, comforting idea. I would definitely purchase this. Health benefits are a total plus too.
2) Reservations - none for me, but again, perhaps those avoiding sugar might not purchase.
3) Occasions - breakfast, snack, after dinner treat
4) Appeal - all types - people who like warming, spicy treats. People who love chocolate. Defintely a more 'grown up' taste than just regular hot chocolate, so probably more young-adult oriented.

Concept XLVII (HPH) Almond Breeze Golden Milk:
1) Likes - I think this sounds interesting because of the health properties. There may be other 'golden' drinks on the market, but I have not tried them yet, and am wondering about the taste - like, can you taste turmeric?
2) Reservations - if you can taste turmeric, is it mild? I've had it in powdered/spice form and it's OK, but not a favorite. I'd definitely like to try a sample of this before purchasing.
3) Occasions - after workout, mid-day snack
4) Appeal - I think more of an adult market for this; those who are into working out, sports, fitness etc. Concept IV (QW) Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion:
I would try to limit the amount of added sugar, while keeping a spicy, invigorating, comforting taste. If just honey was used and no processed sugar, the health benefits would be even more impressive!

Concept V (QW): Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate + Sea Salt :
Again, I would try to limit the amount of added sugar, while keeping the comforting vanilla and chocolate/sea salt flavors.  If just honey was used and no processed sugar, the health benefits would be even more impressive! Would that be a possibility with a product like this, or would cost be prohibitive?

Concept VII (QW) Almond Breeze Lassi:
Again, I would try to limit the amount of added sugar, while keeping the comforting, smooth mango flavor.  If just honey was used and no processed sugar, the health benefits would be even more impressive! Would that be a possibility with a product like this, or would cost be prohibitive?

Concept XLVI (HPH) Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate:
Again, I would try to limit the amount of added sugar, while keeping the comforting, smooth and spicy flavors.  If just honey was used and no processed sugar, the health benefits would be even more impressive! Would that be a possibility with a product like this, or would cost be prohibitive? Will this also be available in pre-made liquid form, ie just heat and drink?

Concept XLVII (HPH) Almond Breeze Golden Milk:
Not sure how to improve this concept, because I'm not sure of the flavor - but I do love the idea of healthy benefits from turmeric and other bioactive compounds. I'm not sure if this product would contain sugar. If it does, I would try to limit the amount. Concept IV (QW) Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion:
C) Interested - I love these flavor combinations and am aware of the health benefits of ginger and honey.
D) Do you love ginger and honey? Did you know both are not only delicious taste-wise, but they also provide energy and antioxidants to your body. These delicious and nutritious flavors have been around for millenia, and now you can try them in a new and exciting way, with Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion.

Concept V (QW): Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate + Sea Salt:
C) Interested - I love vanilla and chocolate, like most people. I also feel good about giving my body nutritious options and almond milk is a great source of vitamins and minerals.
D) Do you have trouble deciding between vanilla and chocolate? So do we. That's why we created new Almond Breeze almond milk in both classic flavors. They're delicious and packed with calcium, magnesium and unrefined sea salt. Be sure to pick up both and decide your favorite!

Concept VII (QW) Almond Breeze Lassi:
C) Interested - I love mango lassi and would be thrilled to try this new flavor combo from Almond Breeze.
D) Almond Breeze Mango Lassi is a tempting new flavor combo featuring almond milk, cardamom and vitamin-rich
mango. You won't be able to resist this temptation!

Concept XLVI (HPH) Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate:
C) Interested - this hot cocoa mix sounds so delish, I am so keen to try it!
D) Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate is an exotic twist on a true classic. Mix your own with Almond Breeze almond milk for a spicy, nutritious treat!

Concept XLVII (HPH) Almond Breeze Golden Milk:
C) Interested - I am so keen to try this product because of the nutritional benefits and easy, bring-along to the gym product size.
D) Golden-Milk Coconut Blend gives you everything you need post-workout. The perfect blend of healthy coconut oil, turmeric, honey and ginger gives you an energy boost, with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits to boot! Concept IV (QW) Almond Breeze Ginger & Honey Infusion:
1. Nourishing/Nurturing: Honey, ginger and almond milk are all naturally nourishing and healthy. Combined, I would imagine the flavors are nurturing, warm, comforting.
2. Nourishment: Honey is rich in antioxidants and a natural energy booster. Ginger promotes digestion, eases inflammation and is rich in vitamins and minerals. 

Concept V (QW): Almond Breeze Vanilla / Chocolate + Sea Salt:
1. Nourishing/Nurturing: the natural flavors of almond milk with vanilla and chocolate (w/ sea salt) are delicious, classic, comforting.
2. Nourishment: As long as the added sugar is kept to a minimum, this product appears to be very nourishing, with protein, vitamins and minerals.

Concept VII (QW) Almond Breeze Lassi:
1. Nourishing/Nurturing: the natural flavors of almond milk with mango are appealing to many, especially those who have tried mango lassi and appreciate its blend of sweet and tart flavor. 
2. Nourishment: As long as the added sugar is kept to a minimum, this product appears to be very nourishing, with protein, vitamins and minerals.

Concept XLVI (HPH) Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate:
1. Nourishing/Nurturing: the natural flavors of almond milk with chocolate and warming spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and cayenne) is exotic AND nutritious. 
2. Nourishment: I love the idea of a product that sounds different, exotic, delicious and good for the body. Research shows these ingredients support healthy digestion and also provide antioxidants and minerals.

Concept XLVII (HPH) Almond Breeze Golden Milk:
1. Nourishing/Nurturing: the natural goodness and health benefits of coconut, turmeric, honey and ginger give your body a post-workout refreshing boost.
2. Nourishment: I love the idea of a product that sounds different, exotic, delicious and good for the body. Research shows turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties; coconut oil is a good source of healthy fat; honey is rich in antioxidants and a natural energy booster; and ginger promotes digestion, eases inflammation and is rich in vitamins and minerals.",Milkshake,
225817,Susan,Moon,smoon1211@gmail.com,"     ONE. Almond Breeze Settler
1. I like Kefir! I haven't yet found a kefir brand that I love or even recognize regularly, and have sometimes been disappointed by other Kefir brands. I think Almond Breeze would be well aligned to give Kefir a go, since it is already a milky product. 
2. What is Riazhenka? And I've only been privy to non-almond milk kefir; will almond milk kefir still have the same benefits as the non almond milk kind?
3. I would opt for this product as a morning starter - likely sprinkly cereal in as well, depending on if it is slightly thick consistency, and if not then just drink.
4. A health minded person, non-dairy person, who has many other kefir-like products in their diet (kombucha, probiotics, etc)

TWO. Almond Breeze Smoked
1. I love cocktails that have a smokey taste; even better if the contents / ingredients have a healthy base, because usually cocktails can have so much crap in them.
2. Will the consistency of the product be like licquor? Or will it be milky? If it's milky will it curdle the liquor? If it's licquor will it be syrupy? How will it have a smokey taste?
3. Going out for 1 drink after work on a weeknight with a friend at the bar. I like the idea of it, but cant see myself necessarily buying the mixer at the store myself because I don't stock mixers, usually just get cocktails at the bar.
4. Someone health conscious and willing to experiment with new things.

THREE. Almond Breeze Cinnamon
1. I was drawn to this one because the ""Creamy Cashew"" description on the bottle, and also the nostalgic twist point. I'd like to know more about the nostalgic twist bit (what makes it nostalgic?)
2. The product concept seems like it is geared towards some particular function ""anti inflammatory properties"" but, I'd want to expand upon that more. Is this just a cinnamon flavored drink? Or does it really have some health benefit? What are the roots of cinnamon, what is the story behind cinnamon?
3. As a mid-morning (11 am) holdover before lunch, or an alternative to coffee during a coffee work meeting at a coffee shop. 
4. An average person who has a pretty regular routine and likes to keep abreast of health benefits and products that promote general health.

FOUR. Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. Drawn to this, because I've been hard pressed to find good tasting dairy-free hot choco. Also love mexican hot chocolate, for its spicier, less sweeter taste. Would love to see Almond breeze tap into the original roots and heritage of mexican hot chocolate or hot drinks (atole) without appropriating, but giving pride and credit to its origins
2. would work on the packaging, right now it just looks like a novelty product you'd find on the shelf of World Market that you might try once for fun but never again. Would make it look premium or nostalgic, a package that you don't get tired of but that you're drawn to again and again.
3. Winter nights! Would spike it with whiskey maybe.
4. Adults who are tired of Swiss Miss crap, also dairy intolerant people looking for a good tasting, 'healthy' hot choco.

FIVE. Almond Breeze Golden Millk
1. Just because i love golden milk. Would love to see a more affordable option on the market.

3. When I am out and would like to grab a treat-myself pick me up; right now i'll pick up kombucha or goldenmilk only if they are reasonably priced
4. Someone who is ahead of the curve and receptive to new health-oriented products. ONE. Almond Breeze Settler
1. I would emphasize the health benefit and also explanation of how almond-milk kefir actually works (is there any added benefit that it is almond based?) 
2. I'd be curious to know more about the consistency of the drink (thick / light)? Also would consider these being small bottles (like Chobani drinkables) versus one big bottle. 

TWO. Almond Breeze Smoked
1. Smokiness (how is the smokiness derived from the almond? What is the process? i.e. small batch type language to convey) Also please describe consistency of the actual product (milky? syrupy?)
2. Would absolutely amplify the low sugar, no crap content

THREE. Almond Breeze Cinnamon
1. The nostalgic piece-  what makes it so? Is it glass packaging? Is it the font? does it have some story?
2. As mentioned before: The product concept seems like it is geared towards some particular function ""anti inflammatory properties"" but, I'd want to expand upon that more. Is this just a cinnamon flavored drink? Or does it really have some health benefit? What are the roots of cinnamon, what is the story behind cinnamon?

FOUR. Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. Could emphasize heritage of mexican hot chocolate, would research other nut-based mexican drinks and tell a story  around it 
2. Would amplify the non-dairy, no-crap, healthy content of hot chocolate compared to others like Swiss Miss, also the inherent health benefits of the ingredients

FIVE. Almond Breeze Golden Millk
1. Nutty flavor of golden milk
2. Health benefits (i.e. anti oxidants, anti inflammatory), maybe even the process of making it, or emphasize the nutty flavor ONE. Almond Breeze Settler (don't love ""settler"" sounds too obvious of what its settling, a little too explicit) 
C. I would be interested because having Kefir from a trusted brand like Almond Breeze would bring balance to my digestion / inner systems.

D. Introducing Smoke by Blue Diamond (don't love smoke btw, sounds off-brand), a savory, smokey spike to add to your solo night cap or with friends.

THREE. Almond Breeze Cinnamon
C. Cinnamon has been used for (xyz) # of years by (kings & princesses) of (xyz time). The healing properties still as strong as ever today, distilled and delivered right into this bottle. 
D. Introducing Cinnamon by Blue diamond, a subtle drink with a hint of natural sweetness. Concentrated with antioxidants and delivering anti-inflammatory benefits, this drink is for those who seek the unadulterated flavor of old time's past. 

FOUR. Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
C. Finally, a non-dairy hot chocolate that still captures that delicious hot chocolate pleasure but with a hint of spice. 
D. Almond Breeze's Mexican Hot Chocolate taps into the traditions of Mexican hot chocolate making that dates back (xyz #) of years. Preserving the tradition, this non-dairy hot chocolate drink almond based, slightly spicy, and 100% delicious. 

FIVE. Almond Breeze Golden Millk
C. For a midday boost that restores energy and sounds just as delicious as its name.
D. Goldenmilk coconut blend by blue diamond is the perfect infusion of coconut oil, tumeric, honey, and ginger with just the dose of antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties you need to beat the wear and tear of living in the city. ONE. Almond Breeze Settler
1. Nourishing and Nurturing in that it brings balance to all inward processes, can be a neutralizer and combative for all the wear and tear that the body experiences throughout the day. 
2. how the almond base for kefir is beneficial, that would be my main question. 

TWO. Almond Breeze Smoked
1. Not sure if i'd position as nourish or nuture since it's to be paired with alcohol, but rather that it is not deleterious and is actually flavorful to be paired with cocktails. 
2. Nourishment - the nutty flavor that brings a healthy kind of richness to a drink (i.e. healthy nutty fats, not nasty sugars)

THREE. Almond Breeze Cinnamon
1. Nourishing or nuturing in that it forgoes artificial sweeteners and instead using cinnamon sourced from xyz that delivers anti inflammatory properities
2. No sugar added, also would emphasize something like ""cold pressed"" like nitro coffee, but for cinnamon. That's what the packaging makes me think of. 

FOUR. Almond Breeze Mexican Hot Chocolate
1. Nourishing or nuturing in that adults and children can enjoy holiday time spirit without feeling bloated or sugar crash the next day.
2. Nourishing in that the almond base delivers detoxifying properties - so not just pleasure and enjoyment and holiday spirit but also detox (holiday is usually TOXIFYING, but this is detox). 

FIVE. Almond Breeze Golden Millk
1. Nourishing in that the ingredients in golden milk are not typical for western diets, so it introduces excellent antioxidants into the diet

225789,Audrey,Chicago,audrey9899@gmail.com,"Start I love the Almond Breeze Cardamom.  I love the idea of being in balance.  The issues I have and always try to solve are heartburn, ibs symptoms, constipation, etc so I'd love a non dairy product to keep my gut in check.  I would drink this as a snack either morning or night most days of the week.  My only reservation is that I want it to be the right texture, thickness and taste good.  I think it is for any type of person that worries about balance and has digestive health issues.  

The next product that excites me is the frappuccino!!  I want a great coffee drink that is dairy free!!  I love the fact that it is on the go.  I have no reservations I know the folks at Almond Breeze can make it taste great.  I'd drink it as a treat to myself and if I felt I needed a little pick me up.  The person that this would appeal to most is the person that loves coffee drinks and likes to be healthy at the same time.

I'm also excited for the Almond Breeze Yum Pot because I want a delicious pudding treat that is non dairy and is a bit nutty at the same time.  My reservation is the name...I'm not crazy about yum pot.  This would be a treat with lunch, after dinner or just because.  Give me some really good flavor options not just the boring chocolate and vanilla.  This is for a person that likes good quality snacks, or wants to put good quality snacks in the kids lunches.

My next one is the Almond Breeze Paleo - love the idea of a good mix instead of regular flour!  I love the fact that it is plant based and can be used for baking.  I can't wait to try it.  I don't have any reservations at all.  I'd use this for pancake breakfast at home and instead of flour when baking cookies, etc.  It is for a person that wants a better alternative to regular flour.

And lastly I'm excited for the vegan mayonnaise.  I can't wait to use it in my chicken salad, on a BLT, etc.  I love the acronym Almondaise and I think it will be a best seller.  It is for the same person as I've mentioned that is healthy and open to alternatives :-) Cardamom has to emphasize the fact that it is non diary and provides NATURAL healing.  The fact that you can stop purchasing other digestive health products can definitely be emphasized.  Maybe it can come concentrated so just a small dose would do the trick daily, or come in a larger size for those of us that want to drink a regular serving.  In that case you'd have to amplify the fact that it tastes great.

The taste and flavor of the frappucino totally excites me.  The benefit / fact that it is non dairy and almond milk totally can be amplified because that is the best feature about it.  

The Almond Breeze Yum Pot can come in some great flavors and that is exciting for me.  I think the product benefit that it too can be taken on the go, or put in the kids lunches should be amplified.  I would improve the product and add the healthy bacteria that is in yogurts if possible.

Almond Breeze Paleo should emphasize why it is better than white flour.  The way they can amplify it is to refer to their website for a bunch of recipes it can be used in as the flour replacement.  Also they need to sell a larger size from that of the grocery store type at stores like Costco.  

Almondaise is so exciting because I know it will taste great coming from Almond Breeze.  Similar to that of the Paleo they need to refer to their website for different recipes.  I already know a few things it would go into when I'm cooking but I'm always looking for new ideas. Almond Breeze Cardamom - tell me that I'm going to have digestive balance and things like heartburn, constipation, etc are not going to interfere in my daily life and commitments anymore if I use this product.  Not only that it tastes great too and does not taste medicinal.  

Frappuccino - there is finally a non diary almond milk alternative for the plant lover in you!!  Not only does it taste great and is portable, it comes in a variety of flavors and has less fat, and more protein / calcium that the current frappucino's on the store shelves.  

Almond Breeze Yum Pot - looking for a new non diary yummy snack, this is it!  The Almond Breeze pudding is great if you're lactose intolerant, dairy-free or prefer a plant based diet.  Great taste, great flavors and portable.  Perfect timing because I know you run out of snacking ideas, things for the kids lunches, etc.

This is all about gut health and not having the unpleasant symptoms related to poor gut health.  

Almond Breeze frappuccino!!  It is a nourishing treat because it is dairy free, tastes great, and gives you energy.  If this product has some unique flavors, like toffee, caramel brulee, it will be hard to resist.

Almond Breeze Yum Pot is another nourishing treat because like all Almond Breeze products it is dairy free, tastes great, comes in a variety of flavors like toffee, caramel brulee, s'mores.  It should also be nourishing because it has the healthy bacteria added to it like yogurt.  

Almond Breeze Paleo - nourishing you body because it is dairy free and follows the Paleo diet plan.  Now you can incorporate things into your Paleo diet that you've been missing out on.  Whole foods, lean proteins and healthy fats never tasted this good.

319860,Robert,Whitfield,robertrwhitfield@gmail.com,"The last time this happened was probably while playing Hollow Knight - in particular completing the requirements to collect the King Soul in order to unlock the True Ending (which I still haven't achieved) In three words: Relief, accomplishment, elated. Towards the end of last year I became obsessed with Hollow Knight on Switch. It's a 2D metroidvania game that has a strong focus on exploration and challenging combat. I've been a fan of this style of game after discovering the Metroid series as a kid and everything I'd heard suggested that this was an exceptional example of the genre. I was drawn in by the beauty and mystery of the world, and whilst I often found the boss fights (and some of the general enemies) pretty difficult I was so intrigued by the world and the characters that I kept pushing on. Even though it often felt like I was making absolutely no progress whatsoever. Hollow Knight was tough, but it was ultimately fair, and the reward for sticking with it was an expanding view of this fallen world of bugs and a real sense of accomplishment. As such there are many great moments that I could have listed here. Defeating Hornet at the Kingdom's Edge, or the Watcher Knights in the City of Tears were huge moments because I probably sunk a good hour or two (over several play sessions) learning the patterns of the boss fight and eventually (with a little luck on my side) defeating my foes. The Deepnest is another moment. An unforgettable environment that with its narrow, twisting pathways, scuttling spiders, and re-animating enemies creates a truly terrifying and claustrophobic atmosphere. But for me the stand out was collecting the King Soul *Spoilers ahead* Hollow Knight is a game with multiple endings. I unlocked the basic ending after probably 30-40 hours of gameplay. I was tempted to leave it there, after all I'd heard whilst playing that getting the true ending required the player to complete one of the most challenging platforming sections in the game as well as a final boss after the titular Hollow Knight (a boss I really struggled to defeat). So that should have been the end of it. Well, I also discovered that there was more story and information to be learned by following this path, and I just couldn't bring myself to stop immersing myself in this world. So rather than start again I plunged back in to complete these tougher challenges. And boy was it tough. The White Palace is probably some of the most challenging platforming I've ever had to accomplish and it took me several sittings to get through it all as I died to spikes and buzz saws and mistimed jumps again. And again. And again. But finally, I made it. I collected the final piece I needed to complete the King Soul and I was ecstatic. I felt like I had overcome a great trial - thought I still haven't beaten that final boss. I always hesitate to say that gaming is a big part of my life. It's something that really excites and interests me, but that's true of music, films, literature. When I was younger gaming was a way for me to connect with my friends. A friend of mine ran a gaming forum where we'd discuss news and upcoming games, and we'd get together (either in person or online) to play with one another.  Over time I've moved away from multiplayer experiences and for a while stopped gaming all together (it's an expensive hobby when you're an underpaid designer). Today I find gaming allows me to experience narratives that are more immersive and engaging than big Hollywood blockbusters, or act as a way to challenge my brain with unique puzzle and strategy titles, or just provide a way to relax after a day of work. And the flexibility of games means that if I feel like being fully engaged I can follow the deep, twisting story of a narrative adventure, or unwind with some less taxing side activities or weird challenges. Part of me feels like this is where I talk about a game like Shenmue - one of the first open world games ever made - or Breath of The Wild. Big open world games that you can sink hours into. But if I'm honest I'd probably opt to save something like Into The Breach.  Into the Breach is a turn-based strategy game in which you control a group of Mechs fighting back aliens that are trying to take over Earth. There's no grand narrative, and missions take place on a small square grid (almost like a chessboard) across four islands. So why take something simple like this and not a big, important story game? Well Into The Breach has a huge amount of flexibility. For a start every mission is randomly generated. The core components might be the same but they're always in different configurations. There's a range of different pilots to choose from with unique abilities, and Mech squads with different actions available. This means you have lots of different strategic options. How can you take advantage of this squad's ability to use smoke to cancel attacks? How do you deal with the laser mech that also damages friendly units? And whilst it doesn't have a narrative, it still creates stories through gameplay. One night I was trying to complete a run of four islands and on my final mission I realised too late that I'd messed up a move. It wasn't necessarily going to cause me to fail, but it meant that on the next turn I would need to sacrifice the mech and the pilot to stand a chance of winning.  It was a bittersweet victory. Into the Breach is a game I can see myself playing and never getting bored of.",Luigi,
300181,Tom,Evans,tom@tomevans.consulting,"a. immersed, connected, adrenalised  b. Fortnite, at home last summer - with my 9 yr old son and his friends laughing at how bad I was at it! Played on PS4. I saw everyone playing it, and when they weren't playing it they were talking about. When they weren't playing it or talking about it they were talking about trying to get money for V bucks to spend on skins in the game. I saw kids doing the dances on the tube platform. Even football players in the World Cup adopted the dances for goal celebrations. It felt like a phenomena had swept the globe. I have gone through many phase of gaming. From console addict to lapsed gamer to mobile commute puzzle app time waster. (Dots! etc) Nowadays I play rarely. Sometimes 2 player Battlefront with my kids. And as I try and digital detox mobile gaming is out. I occasionally play Lumosity on my phone - more mindful type games, like brain training type thing. Gaming gives me ultimate distraction. And I'm going through a phase where I don't want/need distraction - in fact I'm trying to be more present, read more, enjoy nature, meditate etc. so gaming is taking a back seat. a.

319504,Christopher,Joyce,cj@cjcreative.uk,"a. Adrenaline / Relief / Joy b. This is a combination of feelings I get regularly when playing R6: Siege, on my PC, with friends. It's usually in a clutch scenario where the success of the match/round comes down to whether or not I can defeat the opposing team, usually against the odds, so that we can make a comeback, or win the game. I know my friends, and other random team mates are watching, either as spectators or using the tools inside the game to help me out. This collaborative team vibe is something that I absolutely love about R6:Siege, and really adds to the camaraderie , and pressure - but makes for unforgettable moments. It's like getting cheered on, whilst the crowd is helping you. It can get toxic, of course, but that's half the stakes. You want to perform, you want to win, and you want to show off - and you don't want to be heckled for sucking! I had a moment like this literally last night, playing said game with friends. It's not exactly a rare occurrence to be put in this scenario. It's a 5v5 match, with an attacking team and a defending team. The match is only a few minutes long. The attacking team need to reach the objective and disarm the bombs, whilst the defending team need to prevent this from happening. Naturally, if you eliminate the enemy team before they can achieve this, then you win by default too. We go down to 4v5, 3v5, 2v,5, and inevitably, 1v5. Me vs the entirety of the rest of the enemy team. With only a minute or so left to go, the enemy team is under pressure to attack, secure the objective, or hunt me down and take me out. I know this leads to them making silly mistakes and taking risks to get the final kill, being in a more confident position, so I hold angles, and wait for them to come. I manage to take 2 down, fairly quickly - my team mates shouting call outs in my ears, using the CCTV system in the game to locate the enemies. Now there's hope. 1v3. Naturally they start to take things a little more cautiously, but the clock is on my side, it's ticking down. I hold tight. One enemy pushes me, I beg team mates to calm down and stop backseat gaming in my ears, so I can hear where they're coming from. As they continue the pressure I am alerted to the fact that the other two enemies have began disarming the bombs. This turns the clock AGAINST me now. So, roles reversed, I have to push them. I get a lucky head shot on the one pushing me. 1v2. With less than 20 seconds to go, I push the bombsite, find one of the enemies in a corner, get lucky again and eliminate them. 1v1. I can see the bomb disarming kit, I need to get to it to prevent them winning. Only 10 seconds now. I push for it, but the remaining enemy is holding a solid angle on it, so I have to risk pushing him. At this point my heart is beating insanely fast, and my team mates are stressfully silent. The enemy pokes his head out too far, and I get another lucky shot. Leaving me to disarm the defuser with milliseconds to spare. I manage a clutch and we can continue the match, to make a comeback. There's cheering in my headphones from friends dotted around the country and Europe. It's a real thrill, and we're about to start the next round, and do it all again. a. I think gaming has a few roles in my life. The first role is escapism, like a book or a film. It's a chance to switch into a different world, away from the pressures of our own, and forget about the day. The second role, is social. Multiplayer games on my PC, Switch, or Phone, are an absolutely solid way to maintain lifelong relationships with friends all over the world, but especially back home. I have a close-knit group of friends back home, and we grew up playing games together. Playing online every now and again has been an easy way to keep in touch, chat about our lives, and unwind. I know for sure that the friends I have, further afield, that I don't game with - get less chat/call time. Not by any choice, it just works that way. It's kind of killing two birds with one stone. We can play together, and stay in touch. Valuable. Important. The third role, is probably the competitive nature of multiplayer gaming. I love the challenge and I love playing against real people. I'm quite competitive by nature, loving the fun of pitting myself against others, whether it's in sport or anything else. I enjoy the fun of it, more than I enjoy the winning. It just feels more real, and worthwhile, when playing with/against real people.  b. I usually play in the evening if with friends, as it generally depends on us being out of work, and able to get online to a PC, or on a Switch. Naturally, the Switch is a bit more portable than a PC, so is less restrictive in allowing us to play together. As I touched on above, gaming gives us the chance to be virtually together, and to connect/re-connect. a. Right now, R6:Siege.  b. It's just such a phenomenal game, that I sink more hours into than I care to admit. I enjoy the thrilling moments I have with my friends on it and would miss them if those moments were no longer possible.",Luigi,
295473,Nathaniel,Cole,natty.cole@gmail.com,"a. Shock, Accomplishment, Sadness  b. I was playing God of War over the winter/spring and it is an incredible game. I first played GoW in 2005 so to see them remake the game and completely rework the fighting mechanics and story...the mythology, everything was done to such a high standard. I really felt like I was playing one of the best games ever while playing it. So, my moment is when I completed the game. As I stated above, I felt shock, accomplishment and some sadness too. The shock was from the realisation that I had actually completed the game. It's a medium level of difficulty and for me with my rusty gaming skills, it took  a while for me to get into and understand the fighting mechanics and everything. It was shock that I had really come so far. The Accomplishment was exactly that. I had put my mind to something and achieved it! Well done me basically! The sadness was because it felt like the journey was over. This rich story that I was uncovering each time I played the game had now turned is full head. It's sad to know that I can never experience the game in the same way again. I immediately started to read up on more of the lore and the world that they had built for the game so I could better understand what the sequel would bring. Who the characters were, theories for what happens next and so on. I really didn't want it to end. There's such a huge twist at the end of the game too which just added so much to the whole experience. A lot of games that are story-based single player have New Game+ modes where you can replay the game but with your skills and abilities that you obtained from the last play-though but that doesn't appeal to me as much. a. Gamings role in my life is one that allows me to escape. To switch off and put my mind somewhere else. As I type this, it sounds like I'm talking about meditation, which is interesting. I think it's slightly different because my mind still needs to be active for it. I don't have to think about other things as well, so it's a nice distraction that I get to have, without the need to address underlying issues really. Which is good and bad at the same time, but sometimes we just need to put our head somewhere else for a few hours. b. It allows me to get that 'me time' without leaving my house. That might sound odd for some but my home isn't my calming, relaxing space to be honest. I live with family so it's pretty active and busy during the day. It quietens down after 9pm. That is when I can game and get that much-needed 'me time'. It also lets me do this without exercise. I run to get me time but that's physical. This is like my mental 'me time'. I used to be really sociable and play with my older brother and his friend on Xbox One all the time but I stopped that last year as I didn't like the fact that I needed other people to play games. I much more prefer my solo, isolated gaming now. A. Oh man. This is a tough one. I genuinely think that The Last of Us is the best game that I have ever played. It's just incredible from start to finish. I would have to take it. B. As I mentioned, the game is phenomenal and the experience that it gives you from a story point of view is unmatched. It is truly fantastic. It goes above the rest because while they are enjoyable, they don't deal with the same issues that Last of Us did (rape, end of world, parenting) and in that way. It's a serious, necessary game that uses its medium to convey a deep message.",Luigi,

319501,Zac,Masih,zacmasih90@gmail.com,"A) Confident, focused and in-control B) This must of been about 3 weeks ago, but I was playing a game called League of Legends on my PC and I had just entered into a game with a few well known streamers/ players. This was a definite gaming highlight for me, a milestone if you wish. I had a friend who is very very good at the game and he invited me to play with his team as he was a man down, I accepted and turns out I was going up against players I absolutely idolise- players who have competed in the recent world tournament. Just being in a game with these players put me in a whole new state of focus, a state of focus I haven't been in for a very long time. I loved it, the rush, the competitive nature but most of all being able to test my ability against players who are huge within the community. A) I've mentioned this before, but gaming has been huge within my life for a long time now. Having played competitively back when I was at university, gaming has always kept me sharp and kept me striving for more- and I genuinely feel this spills over into my drive in my career and personal goals. Gaming is hugely important because it also allows me to switch off into another world where, me and my online friends strive towards the same goal while simply having fun. I've made so many friends and it's amazing when everyone has the same mindset and very similar personalities when you play. B) Gaming definitely gives me the ability to tap into another personality. I'm a very different person when I game and my friends when I game are very different to my everyday friends. Gaming allows me to, switch out as opposed to switch off, swapping into a different world where I can re-live memories and levels while moving forward and reaching new goals. Before gaming, i was already very competitive, but I've never found a wider community which is striving with that same competitive nature that I've grown up with. A + B) If I had to save one video game it would be League of Legends. I've worked so hard at that game and made so many great friends and connections through it that it would genuinely create a pretty big void in my life if I happened to have lost it in a fire (haha). I've mentioned before in person, but the community is amazing, not only while you're playing but the community through Twitch and YouTube. It would definitely crush me if I had to leave that community of couldn't simply enjoy playing with friends, weirdly enough, who I have never even met in person.",Luigi,
319502,Cameron,Masih,cameronmasih@gmail.com,"The moment i will be talking about is when i almost qualified for the solo world cup in Fortnite battle royale. 
 How i felt.
- Excitement 
 - Nervous 
 - Determined 
 I played the Fortnite world cup qualifiers from my bedroom (where most of my gaming happens) and i played it on my PS4 console. What prompted me to play it was i had a lot of people telling me that i should try to enter the world cup as they all said i was good enough to enter for the prize pool; after seeing the details i decided to try out for week 5 and 7 solo qualifiers. Unfortunately i was unable to qualify as both times i missed the leader board by a small amount of players, but with the amount of people that tried to qualify in the EU region i was still proud with how far i had gotten. The games were very fast pace and tense and required 100% focus at all times as a lot of skilful players in division 7 were trying to qualify for the world cup, as they had to do so in the time given to get a shot at the $1,000,000 prize pool. Gaming plays a very big role in my life and it has done from a young age as I've watched my older brothers play a lot of games over the years and i have also done the same, I also think its safe to say that currently I play games everyday. Gaming is very important to me as i think it helps me take a break from everything for example education, as we can often receive a lot of assignments and after finishing them i need to just wind down and do what i love (gaming). Another reason why gaming is important to me is because i have made a lot of friends from gaming and it can always give a sense of community as well as taking you through a whole new adventure.  If i'm at college then when i finish i usually play for around 5-6 hours but if i'm on half term etc. then i will usually play for around 12 hours in a day.  Gaming just gives me that experience and adventure that nothing else can for example being able to drop into a battle royale field or fighting big monster bosses in my favourite MMORPGs or jumping into summoners rift for a great PvP experience. Gaming takes me through different journeys that i thoroughly enjoy and gives me that feel of adventure that nothing else can. Despite my love for all of the games i play i think i would have to save Fortnite. the reason why i chose Fortnite is because it is the most popular game at the moment which means i could still play with my friends and still be able to meet a lot of people from the Fortnite community. With Fortnite being the most popular game at the moment it also opens doors for me as i could potentially grow a YouTube channel based on Fortnite due to there being such a big player/fan base. And of course overall, Fortnite is a really fun game to play and i can access it on my PS4, PC and on my Phone therefore making my gaming experience such that bit better.",Luigi,

b) It was the first time I had a chance to play the Resident Evil 2 remake! As soon as I got home from work, I sat myself down with a beer and put my phone out of reach. I was playing the same way I normally play games - on my ps4 with a big screen TV in my bedroom. I'd been excited to play the game for so long, and had gone as far as not playing the timed demo that been released as I didn't want to limit any experience of the game/not be able to re-play it.  

The first 45 minutes of the game completely blew me away. The attention to detail, the atmosphere, the nod to the past coupled with the amazing graphics and sound design - it all built to create something that made me feel lucky to be playing it! While I didn't have extensive knowledge of the original game for the ps1, I have a fondness for later instalments in the series and have seen friends play the older games enough to build a relationship with the characters and plot. 

The game perfectly introduces the mechanics and gameplay in a short section in an abandoned gas station, building tension fantastically as you explore the cramped and expertly lit surroundings before encountering the first zombie enemies in the game. It all felt so faithful to what I knew of the games before, and yet simultaneously a very up to date gaming experience in both technical and atmospheric terms. So, I suppose to summarise - I got a rush playing the prologue of the Re2 remake, I think due to a combination of amazing atmosphere, nostalgia (extremely powerful for someone my age, I think), gameplay, and the overall feeling that I was lucky to be able to play something so phenomenal! It genuinely felt special and will stay with me for some time. a) For me, gaming is best described as a release or as an escape. And because as the older I've got, the more I've valued my free time - I'm very selective about the kind of games I want to invest my time in! So gaming is important to me, but perhaps not as important to me as it used to be - that is to say, I used to be able to spend hours playing games that weren't necessarily that great and it was definitely much more of a time consuming hobby. But over time, my interests have diversified, and in all honesty other things in my life have become more important. I've more of an appreciation of making things, exercising and spending time away from screens.

b) There are essentially two types of gaming/occasions that are my absolute favourite - these two types of play are experiences I can't quite replicate in other parts of my life, so will always be something I make time for!

• The first is a fully immersive, escapist experience. The feelings I get from the best big budget titles can be something all-encompassing - I love living through a story and engaging with polished gameplay.  Some of the best examples I can think of throughout the years would be: The Last of Us, (perhaps my favourite game of all time), Resident Evil 4, the God of War games, The Uncharted Series and the Rocksteady Batman games to name a few. I think it's getting harder and harder to find games that really captivate me to be honest! I think I have more of a preference for plot than a lot of gamers. If the writing and character relationships are off, then I'm much less likely to be invested. Naughty Dog is a studio that consistently delivers. Basically, imagine the experience a non-gamer might get from being invested in a critically acclaimed TV show or film. I'm normally looking for the gaming equivalent, because it's like that, but with a deeper connection or more engagment. 

• Couch co-op - specifically scrolling beat em ups! I cannot quite get the same kind of fun from any other aspect of my life. Growing up playing mega drive with my big brother (Streets of Rage being my favourite), I have always loved the feeling of working with a friend to beat a game. It kind of feels like a really bonding experience for me, as weird as it sounds! It turns into something bigger than the game - it becomes this challenging, funny, silly experience and a really good way to get to know people and make good friends. I suppose this is quite different to the other occasions I play, as these games tend to have little to no plot and even the current front-runners in this genre don't really compare graphically (but art style and soundtrack are key!) a) Max Payne 3

b) taking a purely factual/statistical approach to this question! This is the game I have played the most and completed the most in all my years of gaming. The mix of arcadey action and high adrenaline set pieces, plus a plot I still never fail to enjoy make for an experience I think I would repeat again and again. Not to mention I love the protagonist and seeing his evolution over the years and in this particular game. I also find it really replayable because you can just continue and continue to improve on every playthrough - always aiming for a flawless run of that tricky section, dodging every bullet and hitting all the enemies before you hit the concrete! No playthrough is quite the same either - the ai seem to always behave differently, making every encounter a great challenge.",Luigi,
295466,Ioana,Lupascu,ioana.slupascu@gmail.com,"I was surprised, overjoyed and enthusiastic by the craft of Monument Valley. I first hear of it through a friend that was surprised I haven't already finished it. Given its distinctly architectural style and play on geometry I was surprised too that I didn't know of it. As soon as I downloaded the game on my phone, I got a new sense of appreciation of the gaming industry. The visuals are stunning! Also, although the main instinct was to play as fast possible to finish the game, I soon became aware this is not a racing game. Monument Valley is an experiential, immersive game. Plunging in in my headphones to listen to the soundtrack, made me aware of the slow pace I need to take. There are only a small number of levels. There is a story and for a change the characters are mother and daughter. It feels like a journey playing the game, not a competition. I enjoy the occasional game, mostly out of pure curiosity. It's an interesting field with a very particular way of thinking. More that anything, I like pondering about what made the designer make these particular decisions. What though process was used in designing the game? Do the creator enjoy the games they make or is it only for the interaction with the gamers? As a designer, I often switch between user and maker, I like having this dual experience.  What I get when playing games is an insight into a different way of seeing and interpreting the world, new creative thoughts. It also happens with reading, watching films or videos, but with games, I am an integral part of the environment. I enjoy the ability to manipulate an environment within the limiting capacities of the game design. I like how it challenges my brain to make decisions and explore. Out of the ones I know and have played, will probably save Limbo. Although I have never finished the game - got too frustrated with it, I think it's just really well made. It has very typical game elements but adds a quirky, unusual spin to it. The soundscape is great, the visuals are well detailed, it's a great exploration!",Luigi,ENFP
317605,Helen, Bell,helenbell@ymail.com,"  Within the app I’d expect support - forums/community section where customers can ask questions and anybody can reply. I’d expect them to be monitored and a Zen employee to respond with the correct answer, even if another customer has answered it correctly. I’d expect chat support, offered 24/7, other contact links such as various email addresses and phone numbers with opening times. Self help resources. Blog so customers can keep up to date with what’s happening within the company and any other news like charities/community events/work, awards, relevant articles etc. I’d expect the ability to change details like address, phone number, email, bank details, direct debit date. Possibly an option to change my plan or add on extras. My previous bills, balance and ability to pay that in the app, amount spent so far during the current billing cycle. Speed test, previous and current usage stats. Somewhere to show if there are issues in specific areas.  I’d expect the app to be very well designed, for it to be easy to navigate and visually appealing. No clutter. Touch ID to access it or at least certain areas of the app with personal details/extra controls 3 brands that I love the apps for are Monzo, Uber, and Netflix. All have a similar user experience. They’re easy to navigate, not cluttered, and have useful resources   ",Liteyear,
317606,Lauren, Turner,laurenturner975@gmail.com,"The companies that have kept me as loyal customers and made me feel like spreading the word are ones that excel in customer service and provide a great product.  I really value multiple ways to contact the company (ie web chat, telephone, email and Twitter. And I appreciate it even more when I am not left waiting to be connected to an advisor too long, and the advisor is friendly, polite and understand what I am asking and tries to help instead of reading a script.  I value a good product that isn't overly expensive, does what it says on the tin, and is easy to use. And it is an added bonus if their social media accounts are on point, making me laugh and engaging with everyone! I would most probably retweet funny content and competitions. 1. O2.  O2 is a mobile network providing phone and data service across the world. I have chosen O2 because they have always had the best service in my area (I once entered a two year contract with another network and hated it, and will be with O2 now for a long time). Their prices are reasonable, their service is top quality, and their social media is informative, helpful, fun and interactive with lots of competitions and fun information. Zen could adopt all three of these qualities, but in particular their social media direction. It really involves current and potential customers, so long as they are kept engaged.  2. Lego Ideas Lego Ideas is a community platform where Lego enthusiasts can share their ideas for creation. Other members of the community then vote their favourites, and the top ones can be put into production, with the original poster being compensated in some way. I enjoy the collaborative community here, Lego welcomes the ideas of its users, and really focuses on their ideas. Zen could adopt this initiative by introducing a community forum on their website where customers can make suggestions to improve or change the way things work, with others voting on their favourite ideas and saying why. 3. Zoella Instagram page Zoella is a lifestyle brand sold in high street drug stores. Their Instagram account is particularly interesting, especially the Instastories feature. They have a marketing plan and every day post something the readers can get involved in. For example, discussing their favourite book, or posting screensavers, recipes, things to do or things to read. I chose this because It is an interactive way to stay at the front of everyone's minds. I think this would be useful to Zen, but they need to ensure that their contact is engaging.     ",Liteyear,
317607,Tom ,Coles,tomcoles92@gmail.com,"  '- An app would have basic features such as your current internet/ upload speed, as well as a notification for any issues etc. From this screen, payment plans could also be accessed, plus any upgrades, if applicable. Features could also include access to any of the Zen add-ons or features as discussed in the previous exercise. - An app would allow you to access information on your account, next payments, any deals upcoming, renewal dates etc. This could also be used to outline internet safety. - This could control add-ons and renewals. - This may surprise by being a hub for the lifestyle elements of Zen, such as monitoring their environmental efforts. Perhaps there could be live streams of litter being removed from oceans or beaches, or articles on encouraging people to go zero-waste.' BT wifi app: I've chosen this one because this is the internet I currently use, though I didn't bother downloading the app until now! One of their features is to automatically connect to a wi-fi hotspot, potentially saving data. This seems like a good general use app that sets a good standard for the minimum requirement. My EE:  I've chosen this because they're a popular provider and their app is very well-presented. The app allows users to control their pay monthly or pay as you go accounts, allowing members to view their bills and staying on top of charges, adding add-ons if necessary. This particularly appeals because it's useful to have everything in one place, plus a place to add additional features. It's also good to have somewhere where there's a central area to report issues or complaints, making users feel like they are being listened to. They also reference constantly updating their service and features, which is encouraging when signing up for a service. Plusnet Mobile:  Plusnet mobile has been chosen as they're a smaller provider. Their setup is more basic and looks less impressive. They allow members to track spending, usage and add bolt-ons. This is useful if a little basic; I would expect this to be the bare minimum. I would also expect an app to be presented a little better; this seems a little slapdash and would refer sharper, clearer icons, and an app that had more interesting or useful functions (as discussed in the previous exercise) that went beyond base functionality.

317600,Amanda ,O'Shaughnessy,amandacoshaughnessy@gmail.com,"    1. Bulb energy
The energy provider that we have now signed up to for our electricity plan. They have a specific community to allow customers to talk to them and other customers about ideas for Bulb and how they can improve. The community section also shares advice on how to save energy / make life greener. It breaks away from the standard customer service email / phone / FAQ page setup and encourages people to come together to knowledge share instead. This in turn benefits customers and the company alike.
By introducing a Zen community you could again farm great ideas from the power of a community to improve and evolve - the value is that you’re gaining this from the horse’s mouth so to speak: your own customers. But it also allows people to exchange advice and inspiration from anything to child safety online, navigating fraud and secure website watch-outs to fun, inspiring web resources and portals for passion points and different lifestyles.

2. Madeline Moves
This is a fitness app I use for strength training, HIIT and conditioning. It’s amazing as it provides a wealth of exercise routines on a weekly basis. You can save favourite workouts for future reference, weekly workouts are banked for two weeks allowing you to go back to them if you miss them. And there are other routines that allow for more cardio if you prefer. 
The reason I chose it is Madeline is super vocal about how to use the app to its max and is always answering FAQs on her Instagram stories, sharing pointers on how to customise routines for instance or how to navigate the pages in case of confusion. In addition, as part of your subscription you get access to a Facebook community where you can ask literally anything to those who are like-minded and have the same goals, all journeying through the app. It can be anything regarding macro tracking, substituting exercises if you have knee pain or if you work out from home rather than gym. It’s brilliant and I go on it daily.

Zen could use Instagram stories, IGTV and posts as an effective way to engage and inform consumers with content. For example Q&A sessions, polls (e.g. you can offer a vote on service packages / offers). Again Facebook communities could be so invaluable - they allow for great discussion and knowledge share but I often find those who engage are serious - they’re there because they subscribed (e.g. many podcasts have these in place and the only way you can join is if you know of the podcast and you subscribe that way) so there isn’t the trolling that can be experienced with some forums. Zen can learn a lot from the community here in regards to their habits and patterns, preferences and what they need more of. But I think they are great examples of breaking away from using a page to house a tome of info in one space and allowing people to inform each other with the support of the company.

3. Latest in Beauty
This is a beauty box subscription service I use to trial new beauty products on the market in a cost effective and fun way! As I travel a lot the samples also provide me travel-sized products which is always helpful.
Whilst you can purchase special edition boxes that are already curated, you can also build your own, customising it with products you truly want rather than what is selected for you, e.g. like other beauty subscription box services like Birchbox. I also love that as a member you get exclusive access to certain box launches, special offers and unboxing moments on Instagram to get you excited.
Zen could offer subscription benefits that support the various consumer lifestyles and complement these. They could send a pack on sign-up as a welcome pack and then each year send a pack that contains info on the latest news from the company, services and pointers but also other benefits like exclusive partner offers, e.g. Netflix subscription offer or an unlimited data offer for roaming. They could also include other elements to support CSR, e.g. offering people the chance to contribute to the planting of a tree / aiding sustainable energy growth, etc. Better still you could offer people the chance to customise their membership pack so each offer / item isn’t wasted and supports their lifestyle / interests.  ",Liteyear,
317601,Gary ,Roberts,Robertsdavidgary@gmail.com,"I think an easy way to have one person spread the word of a brand with friends/family fairly immediately would be if the brand gives you a deal that means you can offer a friend AND also get something back for doing so. A simple example is I can give a friend £50 credit for joining but I also get £50 credit if they sign up. Okay repeating myself a bit from the previous question but: 
 Bulb : £50-£100 credit for both your friend and you when you get them to sign up. As mentioned before it’s a great amount of money to offer a friend / receive but also for their brand message/mission statement anyway it’s something I can get behind anyway. Credit is an easy thing to offer for broadband... so easily adaptable for Zen. 
 PS Plus: PlayStation offers you a deal where you pay a monthly subscription and have access to buy games at a cheaper rate but also get free games included etc. Is there a way that Zen could offer some joint deals with other companies and maybe together they could give discounts for other products etc.  AirBnb: This is maybe a bit abstract for a broadband company but we use AirBnb a lot, and a few years ago did share a lot with friends to get credit. Now though it’s become the go to when travelling instead of paying for a hotel and it obviously revolves around the idea of a community that talk, stay with one another, trust, experience. It’s obviously totally different to a broadband community but if there was something that meant Zen could bring people together to either talk about “Zen” things? Wellbeing? Maybe there’s “Zen” events for customers... like a mini festival?     ",Liteyear,
317602,Josh,Mann,joshmann33@gmail.com,"    1) Laithwaites Wine
- They emailed me to find out why I was no longer engaging with their emails.
- I personally love email marketing and I liked the upfront nature of their query (we're tracking everything, now tell us why you don't read our emails).
- The use of a reward in exchange for information is refreshing. Almost everything is transactional now, more often than not online this is the exchange of your email address for information or access to a service.
- The idea that they would ask for more information in order to improve their service for me as an individual or try a new method to re-engage me is neat.
- They transformed emails into interesting content by dropping the purely promotional angle and talking to me differently.
- Zen could offer rewards for engaging with the brand, could use a unique tone of voice and/or treat users as individuals, by engaging with them all differently (or at least segmenting them into smaller groups).

2) Monzo
- Emailed me to tell me about changes to the T&Cs...boring!
- They used eye catching & friendly imagery to put me at ease. Whilst I didn't read the whole email, it didn't get deleted straight away and I scanned the main points.
- Zen could give their brand a 'face' or 'personality'. Gaz & Leccy for smart meters, the cute flame character from N-Power and Alexander the Meerkat for Compare The Market. Halifax have adopted well known characters that resonate with the target audience such as the Flintstones, Scooby Doo & Thunderbirds. This can make the brand more approachable and softens it from what it is (a bank, a finance brand, a utility provider).

3) Virgin Money
- They emailed me about their consolidation with another bank...again, boring!
- They start by telling me that nothing is going to change. Good start. I only have this account as a somewhat temporary measure, so I'm not invested in it for the long haul, so I'm unlikely to engage with the content, so brief is better.
- They helpfully created a (colour branded) section that stood out and gave me the TLDR Cliffsnotes of what the changes meant to me.
- Zen can adopt an approach that acknowledges that customers have 101 other things they need or want to do with the time. By making things simple and easy to read I feel far more positively towards the brand. If I am going to be effected make that clear, if I'm not just let me know about the change in as short form as possible.

4) A brand that has pushed me away is Vitality
- Whilst there were various factors to my leaving the brand, one thing that bugged me and seeded resentment was their tone and approach to change.
- They continuously cut their benefits and each quarter I would receive the magazine and an email telling about the changes (which were never for the better IMO). Instead of acknowledging that I was now getting less for my money or benefits would become harder to achieve they would hide behind phrases like ""Great news, we're making changes..."" I would then proceed to read about all the downgrades they were introducing.
- Zen can learn from this by acknowledging that customers aren't stupid and should talk to them as such. Be honest and I will be more likely to stick with you. I need to trust a brand if I'm going to commit to them long term.  ",Liteyear,INTJ
317603,Liv ,Hayes,Olivia.Hayes@ed.ac.uk,"  Firstly, I love this idea and am very keen on the thought of having control of my broadband via a mobile app.  This app would have:  A communication tool which would connect the user with staff in the Zen office/call centre. You'd be able to access an online chat service and be able to deal with billing, network, and connectivity issues and queries via an online chat service via your smart phone app. I hate spending my evenings/lunch breaks on hold to deal with issues related to any household utility and love the thought that I could manage any problems via an app on my phone during my daily commute! Fingerprint recognition & a password as security/appropriate identification when dealing with billing queries cutting down the need to spend precious time on the phone & often on hold! Up-to-date information on your monthly, weekly and daily usage. Alerts where there are network issues in your area, i.e. a pop-up notification if enabled - if not enabled then a text message would be sent to the user Information I want to access:  Billing information, the date my payment will be taken, how much and the ability to download a statement My monthly usage and a breakdown of the usage per device (if that is possible) Max download speed available at the time (i.e. if your using the network during a high demand time, that information is available on the app) Suggested 'quieter times' would be an added bonus. What would it allow you to control:  It would allow you to switch the internet on and off from your device either at set times or as you please, for example, to switch off the internet during mealtimes Parental controls - limiting access to certain websites Set monthly/weekly or daily limits Check your usage against those limits The bank account/card which is debited each month (i.e. able to update this information in the app). The date the debit is taken. Increasing or decreasing monthly tariffs/data limits Pause my usage for a month/holiday period.  How might it surprise and delight you? I think it'd be really cool if you could set a profile for the household and the app would be tailored to include only the information/functionality that home is interested in. For example, a household of flat mates might be interested in seeing a breakdown per device, whereas a family home may like the ability to switch off the internet for particular times of the day (e.g. meal times). Again, it ultimately comes down to giving customers the opportunity to make their experience as personalised as possible, there are numerous functions on apps that I do/don't use and it'd be sweet if I could tailor the app to only what I'm interested in seeing. An added bonus would be a notification via the app if my monthly or daily usage was significantly higher than normal, especially if I was on a limited plan! 1. British Gas App This app gives me a monthly breakdown of my gas and electricity usage. I've found the app to be really user friendly and intuitive. It has up to date information on my billing information and notifies me when a new bill is available or when a gas reading is due to be submitted. I can also set a home profile and see where my usage is (smart meter only

This is one of the best utilities app experiences I've had and I'd suggest that Zen use this as a template model to build from. I like that fingerprint recognition is all that is required! 
 2. Airbnb The app is really easy to use however I have had difficulty in updating payment information when a card has expired or I've moved countries. I had to go onto the Airbnb website to update payment and billing information which I found frustrating when trying to book accommodation. Airbnb now offer the ability to split your payment into two payments and it notifies you around 5 days in advance of your second payment being taken, I really liked this (especially as I'd forgotten about the second payment) and doesn't make for any nasty surprises when checking your bank account. I think the payment notification is a great idea and something Zen could/should adopt for their own app. 
 3. Monzo Again, I find this app incredibly intuitive and easy to navigate. I use my Monzo card solely for my 'fun spending' (i.e. eating out, nights out, etc), and generally only transfer money to the account when required. Monzo sends me a notification when the funds are running low and I'm due for a top up. I love that it does this- I do not want to be caught out unable to pay for my meal and it keeps my 'fun spending' in check so I can keep tabs on exactly where my money is going each month. I think Zen could adopt a similar idea by sending a notification to users when they are close to their monthly data limits.   ",Liteyear,
317612,Lillian, Philip,Lillian.lee@outlook.com,"     1. When choosing a broadband provider, one that speaks my language. I don't know how many MBPS I need, I just want to know what I can do e.g. You can stream a full length HD movie in 5 minutes, all whilst scrolling Instagram, uploading photos on 5 different devices. 

2. It's a straightforward, upfront and SHORT (less than 10 minutes) process, I know how many steps there are in the process, and where I am. E.g. sign up, then there is a delivery and setup within 14 days, there's a cool-off period, etc. You're up and running in 14 days... I don't even know if this is possible!

3. when I'm waiting to received my kit, would be great to have a text the day before which gives me a 2 hour window of when it might happen. 

4. Ongoing account management - I really don't want an app, or sign in details, I just want to chat to someone over the phone (with a number I can google, none of the call back business, unless its pretty instant), or random re-routing through loads of ""press this number for XYZ"". Live chat would be nice too, but if I need to contact my broadband provider, I probably can't get online that easily. 

5. What would make me feel valued, is if they value my time. I want every interaction to be simple for me, and easy. Loyalty should be valued, so that each year, new customers don't get cheaper deals, or cool bundles that existing customers aren't entitled to. Better yet, bundles for loyal customers that get better each year, something that gets us in tune with tech. Could be a Google Home, collaboration with a tech college, amazon dash, Philips Hue light bulb, plantpot that's wifi enabled to tell you if it needs watering etc. PhotoBox had brilliant customer service recently. I ordered a photo album from them, but it didn't have the matt cover I wanted - I had inadvertently not ticked the box, even though it was a Matt book that was being described. I livechat them, and they told me if was my own problem as I didn't check the box - I had thought it was their mistake! I decided to give it another go, and called them. 
I had a lovely man who listened to my problem, looked at my account, told me ""I can see it's your wedding album and know how important it is to get it right, let me give you a voucher to reprint, do make sure you tick the box for a matt cover. I just need you to return your current album to this address, which I'll email you with all the details."" I was gobsmacked. It took less than 5 minutes, he was calm, upbeat and wasn't condescending or patronising. He also didn't make me feel like they did it for everyone, or that it was my own fault - it was personal. I now print all my albums with them. 
If you can make every 'problem' into a personal fix it service that is tailored to the customers needs, then you'll create both loyalty and brand champions. 
However, you have to make sure it's not only tailored to the customer, that the processes for your company is slick to enable them to do this. There's nothing more frustrating than someone trying to do their best and having to wait forever and jump through a million hoops to get something done. It needs to be slick and quick.",Liteyear,

Zen could look at covering the essential questions  - what happens if my service goes down?  And address other people's concerns.

2) Wix is all about making websites easy to make and use, they have reflected this within their terms and conditions. Using the #ItsThatEasy hashtag Wix summarises each point in the terms and conditions in an easy way to understand. They have also incorporated this in a contemporary way - as they are also about well designed, pretty websites. Zen could definitely do something similar- and summarise each point.

3) I recently was on Trussle's webiste and whilst they don't do anything standout, I feel their language and font make their ts and c's easy to read. Zen can make sure they use easy language, and a font, colours which are easy on the eyes.  ",Liteyear,ENFP
295466,Ioana,Lupascu,ioana.slupascu@gmail.com,"If I think about the brands I rave about without hesitation, they tend to have a clear differentiator from the rest of the brands in the same field. Something simple, effective but not too invasive as a solution. Monzo has a great brand colour you would recognise from miles, Oatly uses the no-cow line and honest, dry humour, Who Gives a Crap - the name and no plastic packaging are the winners. It feels like these brands know their target audience, and that audience brings the message forward to non-targeted costumers.  If the service is genuinely good and transparent, it will naturally attract people. As for making it popular and trendy, since the product itself mostly resides inside the house, a great solution for the router could be an answer. Whether a pop colour, a more aesthetically pleasant box to house the router in, or even a cool plug for the socket. A good first liner to get the conversation started with people.  Another way to go about it, is to make every costumer part of a common goal. Whether it's reforestation, donating to charity or opening a centre for elderly people to meet up and fight loneliness, it's the feeling that beyond just being able to use a service you are also contributing to giving back. An altered version of the Kickstarter Goals, once the network reaches 100.000 costumers, the company invests in planting 100.000 trees. When Monzo rebranded they chose a pop colour that is impossible not to take notice of. That is the conversation starter, then it is the app, it's simple and super user friendly with great costumer service. Also, as a member or employee you can buy shares and be an investor. It feels like a dynamic company that is resilient and adaptable to future changes. Make the Zen service minimal and hassle free, allow costumers to invest in the company.  Who Gives a Crap made talking about toilet paper fun and a way to help other. Apart from producing toilet paper from recycled paper and bamboo, 50% of profits go into building toilet infrastructure in less developed places. Zen could make sure that while expanding as a company, the invest back into the community. It can be workshops to teach people new skills that later that can use to be hired,  or even a play on the name, where the company introduces meditation classes into the school curriculum.   Oatly is a great product and the branding so much fun. They keep coming up with new ways to keep the conversation fresh, whether it's tackling climate change by being super transparent about their CO2 emissions or offering solutions for the after use of the tetra pack (pots for gardening) there is always something. Maybe what is so nice about Oatly is that it does not feel like a mass pleaser brand. It has its own thing going, a bit against the mainstream but definitely very current in terms of service. Zen could also choose a common fight that already has a great community of supporters, it can be by actively pursuing the reduction of carbon emissions to be in line with the Paris Agreement, or advocating for a less energy dependent lifestyle. The secondary goal has to be in line with current affairs, offer a solution and a platform for people to exchange ideas. It can be a forum, a conference that is supported or organised by Zen.

317610,Sean ,Young,seanayoung@gmail.com,"  I covered a lot of this off in an earlier question, but to recap: 
 It would have the following:

24/7 online chat.
Everything should be able to be done from both the app and a webpage.
The app would include all your services and bills as well as downloadable pdfs of your bills.
All documentation and contracts would be accessible via pdf in the app.
There would be a single monthly charge for line rental and Broadband.
The customer service rep would be able to deal with all issues and wouldn't have to pass you on to anyone else.  If they had to pass you on you would only be passed onto one other person and there would be no further wait to get through to them.
The app should show a real time stats dashboard of your broadband connection (with history of how much data has been used, split into categories) to included what speed you are getting vs what speed was promised.
The app should connect through to your router (when on the same network) so that you can easily make changes to advanced settings without having to type in the IP of the router.  The dashboard should also show you what devices are connected to the network.
Cancelling your contract should be simple and quick and should be able to be done from within the app.
The app should hold a history of all telephone calls and in app chat you have had with customer service representatives.  It should also include things like dates and times of engineer appointments and the ability for you to easily change them from within the app. 
 It would allow you to block/remove devices on the network in real time. 
 The app would send you notification based on what you’ve set up. E.g when a user isn’t hogging bandwidth. Starling bank: Simple and intuitive interface. Simple menu system at bottom of screen which gets you to everything you need easily. Subtle but inviting colour scheme. Zen could use a similar menu bar. Fantastical: Clever interface that uses pressure swipes to perform actions rather than going through endless menus. Also uses basic AI so when typing”dinner at 1200 at the shard” it know to populate the time and place fields which makes it very quick for inputting events. Could be used for changing router settings. Seconds: Great interface like starling. 5 button menu at the bottom of every screen so everything easily accessible. I like the tiles timer screen. I think that could be utilised well in any app as a menu with big bold short cuts to other less uses features. Many apps just have a list. The bold tiles can be easily associated with different functions. Zen could utilise in much the same way.   ",Liteyear,
317611,Georgina, Young,georginalyoung@gmail.com,"    I am struggling to think of any product or service I have used where the terms of use etc have been presented in an engaging or interesting way. When I think of every service or contract I have with a provider, beyond the itinial bullet points of what I should get in the package, I always then have to read through the small print to double check there isn't a catch somewhere or just to make sure I know clearly what I am or am not entitled to. Lots of people I know don't bother to do this and I do understand why - it's time consuming and boring. But I just happen to be a fairly thorough person with a fear of getting things wrong and wasting money when already budget conscious so I am generally prepared to read the extra information (within reason of course - I'm talking conditions of medical claims for travel insurance, or cancellation terms of broadband for example, not the mammoth small print that goes with a credit card when I know I'll pay it off via direct debit every month anyway). I have asked my husband this question too seeing as I can't think of any examples, and he can't think of one either!  ",Liteyear,
235001,Freya,Bromley,freyabromley@gmail.com,"To build a community of advocates I would introduce a referral benefits scheme. It incentivises users to positively endorse the service to their friends by offering money off or maybe points for somebody kind of experiential reward scheme. I’ve seen this work well with fitness classes (like Frame) where you invite a friend for free to try out with you. If they then go on to book a class, you get a free one too!  Also banks (like nationwide). Are doing great cash rewards. £100 to the referee and referrer which is a huge financial incentive. They have cleverly marketed this to position themselves as a community bank with friends taking pride in referring them to others.  Lastly it also works the vouchers which many travel websites use. Airbnb in the early days and voyage prive now will give £5 credit for every friend who signs up through you. It’s a great nudge to move people from verbal recommendation to a real follow up as their friend then takes responsibly for emailing or texting the code/link rather than them having to remember to search for it.  Zen could do a cash back reward but I think the most successful would be a week of broadband free for every friend that signs up.

Enticing others by making it more convienent and simple to use so it spreads organically through word-of-mouth during conversations. The process to sign up can be done through mobile, with different tier packages based on usages (pause, resume usage), no hidden set up costs and track the progress of setup easily like Amazon/parcel tracking keeping me informed at every stage. It will deliver what it promises, if it takes xx days then make sure it can be done in less time. Make sure the kit feels like a welcome package and takes all the stress out making it as easy as an elderly to set up themselves or be able to have an add-on service to get someone to do the work for you like a reliable handyman. You have an app that can be shared for household usage and have insights to how you use it, can control when to change package or pause/resume. The statements are digital, there is no need for paperwork. It provides insights in how to best save money by your usage levels. It can also help you reduce your usage levels to develop better habits of internet time particularly for those who are parents too and might want to control the levels of usage on certain devices that kids use. there’s a different pricing model that is flexible and doesn’t require to commit to long term contracts. However, there is a stickiness to stay with Zen the longer you use it or refer others to use it and have shared benefits in some way. Whenever you change home, it should make it easy to decide whether to stay with Zen (catchment area, speed in the area) and be able to compare easily how much people can save money or at least a guarantee for the quality of service at a customer service level but also the broadband qualities itself First example is Monzo and I’ve managed have problems resolved in real-time with the chat assistant twice now: once at an expo purchasing something where I was double charged and the other time I was at the airport setting up Apple Pay with my Amex card for work to have the card verified to be used. These scenarios are in public places where it can be difficult to chat on the phone with all the noise so this text channel for real time support is brilliant. It is supporting the user when things goes wrong and having a human way to deal with it responsively and in s friendly and professional manner.

The second one is Booking.com where there are benefits using an app version (I only just adopted this as most of the time booking hotels feels more natural on a laptop or desktop screen). However, due to easier pay like Apple Pay and also getting better deals when I book with them than other competitors (E.g Expedia) it has immediate benefits for each booking made and will last too. It’s better than the loyalty schemes like BA or Virgin airmiles where I feel restricted after collecting so many airmiles not being able to use it. Whereas Booking.com has made each booking count. Perhaps Zen can find a way to adopt this to retain customers.",Liteyear,
262618,Kate,Rushton,krushtie33@gmail.com,"     I have attached two diagrams (tell me if it is hard to read). The key is minimal disruption, rewards for loyalty, and for me sharing my preferred communication with Zen and for Zen to follow this and only contact me via chat. 

A real reward for me would be offsetting my carbon emissions through replanting of the rainforest etc. but I choose what offsets I want not Zen. Amazon - their chatbot operates 24/7 with minimal waiting time; they refund asap; and are always pleasant and positive. Their user experience and user interface is really not great but that does not matter. If Zen had 24/7 customer service instead of 9 to 5 I would be happier. 

Mindvalley - I had to cancel one of their courses I bought because it was just not working for me. I was able to do this all via email without having to call them. Being able to cancel via email frees up my time. If Zen had the option for encrypted email/chatbot communication, I would be super happy. 

N26 - The whole user experience with N26 is seamless. Information is easily displayed and it is so easy to transfer money on-the-go and track payments. They have upgraded accounts with things that are useful for me e.g. travel insurance and co-working days. I also like the ""refer a friend"" incentive - I get EUR 15 for every friend that joins N26 via my referral link. Can Zen have a referral scheme? I also love the ATM map for N26 Can Zen have a wifi hotspot map for when I am travelling?

AirBnB - I love the fact that AirBnB can be contacted via multiple ways - Twitter, In-app chat, and call back. I don't like being put on hold and waiting in a queue on a call and this allows me to communicate with AirBnB my own way. I love the fact that they now sell AirBnB experiences and you can get a full comprehensive travel package. What else could Zen offer as well as wifi and storage? Could they offer utilities, office supplies etc?

Sleep
Evening relaxation

But on reflection I'm prepared to mess with these areas but only if it works. In other words they are high stakes and super important not to get wrong :) I would like to wake up better. I often feel tired in the mornings and don't feel refreshed, struggle to get out of bed and get going. This may be because of too late bedtime or poor quality sleep.

I would like to be in a constant flow state during my work period - as opposed to peaks and troughs 

I would like to be able to feel tired earlier and therefore go to bed earlier and get to sleep quicker and have better quality sleep Actually on reflection nothing is off limits to me if it works.

I guess the evening 'wife/netflix' time I'd want to be very present for - as opposed to high/distant. But at the same time want to relax...

I guess what is fundamental is the underlying curve of the caffeine dose, I would say that the way that it progressively accelerates + rises over the extended period, to then drop but not sudden enough to provide a crash but quick enough to not disrupt my sleep pattern is essential

How this is achieved is of lesser importance to me, obviously the fact that I enjoy drinking coffee is a massive added bonus but not the deal maker! Say for example - for whatever reason the only way to consume caffeine was via an oral pill or from coffee in its traditional liquid form

the catch is - when drinking via liquid it was 400 calories per mug , but when consuming orally there were 0 calories. Both options offer the exact same caffeine curve and sense of wellbeing.

Despite much rather drinking my coffee and enjoying my time spent drinking it in the morning, I would probably stop consuming it + go for the pill form as this would complement all my other lifestyle factors more appropiately In regards to gap: for me its pretty simple - its really just about maximising the half life of all the positive outcomes showcased in the picture map, without having to be completely wreck less with the total consumption, ie not having to push caffeine consumption past 500-600mg. Ideally consuming say 400-450mg a day

In an ideal world I would be able to achieve the below curve with say a 400mg daily dose and not have to push the upper threshold of whats probably deemed safe but cannot be confirmed definitively 

Also, as you can see from the diagram, if something could be changed, upon consumption the curve would rise more aggressively in the early phase, 10-20mins from consumption to that optimal performance peak without over reaching , then level out + coast  there for the duration of the working day before steadily starting to decline 

all achieved with a reasonable mg dose of the supplement

again how this is achieved is of less importance to me There is not a great difference between my groups. For me it is all about efficiency, bang for buck, risk vs reward

when it comes to maximising the performance/nootropic effects, whilst limiting or minimising health risks.

For me it is all about finding the best recipe/dose that can maximise the above or get me as close to the above as I can

230593,Jacqueline,Travaglia,jacqueline_travaglia@hotmail.com,"I want to feel an adrenalin rush during the day. I enjoy the sensation, feel alive and feel rewarded. It is very satisfying to have this feeling. I seek it out through sailing, rollercoasters, trying new activities I have never tried before and also from getting lots of work done during the day. It is important for me to keep this sensation.

I also want to feel extreme relaxation during the day- I get this feeling through massages, jacuzzis, great sex and also after I have completed a lot of work and feel satisfied and exhausted. This feeling also makes me feel alive ad rewarded. It would be great to prolong the waking up process so that I wake up gently, gradually and evenly. At the moment I wake up and fully focus as quickly as a Tesla accelerates- 0 to 100 in 2.6 seconds!  It would be great for my brain to wake up/accelerate evenly. So I can start off in a deep trance, slowly making sense of the world around me. Then experience my brain slowly acknowledge it's surroundings, then start to tune in to the world around me including sights, sounds smells and eventually for my brain to start to think about the day ahead, then move on to processing tasks. Like coming slowly out of a deep meditation or general anaesthetic. So the acceleration would be more like 0 to 100 in 5 minutes where I transition from asleep to awareness to attention to alertness to information processing.

I would love to not have so many energy dips throughout the day and instead be fairly constant in terms of energy, like driving a car on a motorway! Once my brain is awake in the morning, I want to be cruising along energy wise at a high speed, processing information quickly and having the physical energy to keep up. Now and then I might need to overtake another vehicle- e.g. my brain may have to respond much quicker, sometimes it may slow down a bit due to lots of traffic, but ultimately I want to be cruising with my brain's alertness and body's energy levels at a fairly constant speed.

I want to slow down at the end of the day gradually. Like a cool down after a hard workout. I want my brain to slowly stop processing tasks and to move to just being aware of the world around me and taking it in without judgement or information processing. I want it to then slowly shut down to a sleep state.

I feel this type of energy use would be much more relaxing for me and less tiring overall. I feel I would be more productive as I wouldn't have the mini burn outs I currently experience during the day.  I would still get my little adrenalin shots when my brain needs to quickly process lots of information, but the contrast wouldn't be as great as I currently experience. I also would get my relaxation that I currently experience at the end of the day.

So overall the transitons of my energy and focus levels would be more like a bell curve throughout the day. A slow warmup, high intensity with some very minute variations of lower or high intensity, then a gradual cool down. At the moment I have many peaks and lows during the days. I love the adrenalin of the highs and deep relaxation of the lows- I don't want to change these. The highs make me feel alive and focused. The lows help me to relax deeply, sleep well and switch off.

I would, however, like to change the transitions between the highs and low so that the change is slower and I don't feel utterly exhausted. I would also like to reduce the numbers of highs and lows in the day.

The transitions need to be smoother between my different states during the day. Again if you think of a car, my current journey throughout the day involves continuous heavy acceleration, and heavy braking. Lots of stops and starts. This is very wearing on the engine (e.g. my brain and body!). Redlining is not great for a car when it happens suddenly and often. It also means I am only at top speed for short periods.

I want a smoother ride. I would like to start slowly and graduall, reach high speed and then slow down again, coming to a stop so that the engine has a warm up and cool down. This would result in less wear and tear and a happier engine! I would still get the adrenalin rush of top speed but it would be more prolonged and efficient. I could cruise at top speed longer. At the moment I reach top speed for a short period then brake quickly again! Fully present (being in t  Mind switched “on” Mind switched “on”",Levitate,
325426,Patrick,Smith,patricksmith02@gmail.com,"I have chosen a few areas that I would definitely keep in this map, in green. I have explained with text on the picture for each one. I have marked in red the areas I would change or am working on.

Firstly I have been having difficulty keeping to a strict time schedule, starting my day at 8. Some days I start later, but still manage to be productive. I think I get into my best flow at about 11, so as long as I start working by then I think I can afford to wake later. The problem is if I wake early and then don't immediately get into my routine. So sticking to the graph should be a focus no matter what time I get up.

Overcoming morning anxiety is always a trouble - and I can end up getting absorbed in unimportant tasks or stresses. I think I would add more detail about techniques that could help me with this. The best thing is just already being in a mindset that this will be a work day, and then getting going without thinking too much about anything. Having a stricter schedule might help - that way I have to follow a checklist and getting myself absorbed in checking the boxes could help me avoid that anxiety.

I would add more detail to the initial uptick in energy, because on good days when I get to the top of this, everything else is likely to flow really smoothly. For example - what happens if I do all the right things in the right order, but don't feel good or high energy? What else can I add to make sure this goes well? As said above, maybe just keeping to a checklist or something more explicit or physical would be helpful to make sure I'm mindfully climbing this uptick. And if I don't get to a peak of high energy even when doing all the right things, I think I could then just have an exit strategy (take a few hours to do some creative things or non-work things, then try working a little later).

Having a better work space is a priority for me. I would like more space, more greenery, more light, and clearly separated work/play areas. I would go into more detail about this in the map. Ideally I'd have a completely separated work space from my sleeping space, and then another space for creative activities. Working on this is a big life goal though, might take some time to achieve.

Removing the lunchtime drop off would be good - I don't really experience this so much, if I've managed to get to the first high point. This more often happens when I don't get going well in the morning.

Much like how I'd like additional strategies for getting to that first peak on the graph, I'd also like to add more detail about what that first drop off in focus is about - when it's healthy and when it's not. Ideally I'd notice a dropping in energy levels while I was working towards the end of the day, or a rising contentment, and be able to gradually wind down work in a healthy timescale so that when I finish my brain is not in work mode any more and I can focus on social things, and eating. Still being in a focused, work-centric frame of mind can make socialising really hard and people have gotten frustrated with me in the past for not being present. So I would like to think about this part in more detail and get more used to switching modes.

Journaling is something I need to do more often - on bad days I'm not in a good enough mood to journal, on good days I'm too content and high energy to care about it! I think some techniques would be useful - maybe something like writing a 5-line poem instead of a full journal entry, which would encourage my creative side and make it more likely for me to take a couple minutes out of my day to write something. It looks like the things I want to keep are the overall important fundamentals. So a day that starts with a healthy breakfast, some yoga and meditation, preparing my space and diving into work riding on a wave of positive energy and intention. Then having a brief healthy lunch and knowing how to wind down in the evening. 

The things I'd want to make better are the details - how exactly to keep that uptick going and reach that peak; how my space should look; strategies for noticing my flagging energy and helping that decline into a healthy non-work mindset; strategies to help me keep a regular journal!

I'd be open to trying new things in the latter areas - in the details. But overall I wouldn't want to change the basics - the fact that my ideal day gets going quickly and with lots of energy and positive intention, and I can effectively turn down the intensity dial towards the end of the working day.

235035,Sean,Little,sean.patrick.little@gmail.com,"What areas would you want to keep the way they are?: I wouldn't want to change the fact I get more alert and aware a bit later in the day as I think it fits me and who I am, plus I've become comfortable with it and I like that I work much better at a time when most people are fading out. I am very much ok with matcha and kratom being part of this, and while I wouldn't say I am 100% hands off for that I definitely don't want the option taken away as they both serve a purpose that helps me reach a flow state that I find valuable. I also like my habit of taking breaks and even taking short walks, physically changing locations and environment for a little bit to mix it up and keep me sharp. I think there's a lot of benefit to doing that beyond just staying alert and creative so that is off limits. We’d now like you to tell us about what exactly you would change in these area(s) and why:
I would change the start of my day and my energy levels, specifically how I don't wake up with a lot of energy or focus, with it continuing to drop in plunges followed by plateaus until after lunch around 2 or 3. Specifically it's about sustaining a combination of energy, alertness, and concentration. Each of those things are important for me and harder for me to achieve in the AM, and I often struggle with finding a way to wake up with each of those things in readily available, and then use my reserves economically enough to get me through the first 4 or 5 hours of the day with some reserves left over for when I need them, and not use them in ways that make it feel like I loose energy suddenly and then level out for a period (which in some ways feels like more of a psychological energy loss than physical). This is why I chose the drop off points and start of the day showing AM Kratom for energy because, while this does a decent job of helping me transition and keep energy, I would prefer not to have some every AM as it can sometimes be a little rough on the digestive system. The areas are different because the ones I wouldn't loose help me maintain my energy, focus and concentration, or even gain more back. They help me feel mentally and physically on point and motivated, like I'm getting closer to my ""true"" self energy wise etc. The ones I would change are the down side of this. It's almost like an inverted pyramid for me it seems with the middle of day feeling like what a lot of people feel like at the end of their night. I'm more open to trying things in the earlier parts of the day because the fogginess and lack of clarity/energy I face require more energy to overcome than I even feel I have at times, and I'd like to overcome this without adding too much more to my routine to keep it simple. I would replace aspects if I had a better solution that covered various aspects of concern I have. Sustained Attention (stat  Calming anxiety Executive function (the a",Levitate,

Also a shower after a run is so restorative and rejuvenating to me that I couldn't do with out it.  I think in all other areas I am open to try anything new. I've highlighted in green the areas I really appreciate and I want to Prolong those feelings so for me I find that life can get on top of me and I begin to feel anxious so to have that feeling of relaxation, and rejuvenation is paramount to being able to give focus to the areas of my life that do cause me stress.  That feeling of being invincible gives me good endorphins and can motivate me to achieve more whether its in work or personal areas but somehow I need to reach that Zen state of mind more easily.

The areas i've highlighted in pink are areas that I think I am using 'things' to make me feel better and more alert, especially coffee. So i want to eliminate my 'need' for this or at least reduce my apparent reliance on this.  I've made a deal with myself to go vegan for January to see how this makes me feel so the eggs will be eliminated and look at more natural and plant based options and see how this will effect my energy level and hope that I can get a better equilibrium of energy rather than lows and highs.  I have a reliance on sweet treats which is so apparent on the chart but I literally struggle to go to bed without having had a 'sweet' sometimes its so bad that when I am trying to be healthy my hubby and I will decide not to have dessert, but I'll sneak out for a spoonful of sugar, or hide chocolate in my bag to eat it.  I actually feel physically shaky if I don't have it (I don't have diabetes or anything) but its crazy how it can make me shaky, sweaty and light headed.

I don't like to sleep with earplugs in but have found that I now need to complete silence to be able to go to sleep so its almost become a bit of routine habit but a very hard stuck habit.  2 years ago I wouldn't wear ear plugs as they were uncomfortable but now as soon as there is a little bit of noise I can't sleep unless I put them in.

The areas in blue area ares I want to avoid completely.  I don't want to be irritable or cranky, and I don't want to feel that the start of a run is 'hard' as these are all negative feelings which can really impact my entire day. These areas are different as to me my running and walking with my dog are sacred to me, they are what make me, me.  Hence I don't want to mess with them as I feel like they are my identity.  The other areas are from forming habits, either resulting from my upbringing, current location/situation and/or my own mental impressions of how these things work for me, whether that's come from what I've read, practiced or learnt from others.

Lunch: Lunch is really similar to breakfast however as I mentioned, there are a few brands on my roster.

I know I mentioned focus, but I would like something which helps 'bring me to a level', helps to boost me in my mental and physical focus, helps me feel ready and 'charged'.

Yes I need the almost 'animalistic energy' to smash a workout, but I need something which almost compliments my music- something upbeat, high tempo and sharp and strong. I need more alertness and concentration after a long day but without the comedown and horrible feel afterwards. I need something which can hit me just as I get to my workout while maintaining some positivity before I get to the feeding ground (my dinner table). It's definitetly the emotion which is felt between the two which strikes the biggest difference. I'm so happy when I'm having my breakfast, lunch and dinner.

- throughout the experience I want to be fully present and remember my intention, so I can focus on my objective with absolute clarity. Its ok to get lost in the overwhelming moment, but certain habits (music, conversation with my friends, focusing on my breath and the intention) remind me to be conscious and what I want from the experience
- the integration of the experience is absolute key after. therefore taking a quiet moment and putting my thoughts onto paper is key' I would like to experience the benefits of the psychedelic experience (extreme clarity of thoughts, ability to brush away unwanted thoughts, deep focus on emotional topics, and exploration of my psyche - especially bringing light to unconscious behaviors and strong ability to reflect on my nature/actions from a birds eye view), without the sometimes overwhelming side-effects. These can make it hard to focus on the real intention. Therefore I would like to try micro-dosing and how I cope with the aftermath. I would be able to amplify the positive effects and sharply restrict the eventuality of a bad trip. 

Ideally I would also improve my long-term effects by having someone to integrate my experience right after the trip, or even evaluating my journal. Ideally I would also take time after the trip to use the moment of clarity for an extended meditation.
I would be very drawn to have the psychedelic experience in a safe-space, as security is a crucial feature of a good trip, and makes the latter much more probable. This can be given through the right overseers, but mostly through a calm, serene and non-judgemental place. Music, visual experiences and the right smells can further improve the trip Feeling secure during the trip is of decisive importance for me.
Micro-dosing would potentially give me more control of my body and thoughts, while decreasing the possibility of negative side-effects.
I would be very interested to have the experience in a safe space with professionals, possibly amplifying the effects by mixing in more alternative/traditional/unconventional techniques to access higher states of consciousness.

Missing breakfast usually has negative impact not only immediately after but can all have lasting negative impacts for the rest of the day.  

Coffee I appreciate is like any drug (legal or illegal) can be filtered out.  However, when used in moderation it is a fantastic drug to be enjoyed not only for its taste but for its brain and performance enhancing ability for me personally.  I appreciate the disadvantages for me the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.

Lunch again is an another very important meal and a meal where I can make up a lot of my macro-nutrient requirements for the rest of the day and potentially avoid a heavier dinner later in the evening.  

The gym for me is not only beneficial for physical wellbeing but more importantly for mental wellbeing.  Without exercise I would be an overweight, unhealthy, unproductive and depressed individual. 

6-8 hours of high quality bed / deep sleep time is fundamental to healthy mental and physical wellbeing. It should not be something we compromise on a regular basis. Area A represents the period of time it takes for me to wake up in the morning to me reaching my optimum state which seems to be taking 4.5 hours.  I would like to shorten this period down.

In this state I can process vast volumes of data / information, be a good clinician, be empathic,  lead, teach and innovate.  There are too many variables that cold potentially stand in the way of me reaching this equilibrium.

The second area is the post-prandial dip in state in the early afternoon.  My concentration and focus starts to wean down.  I find that I am slower, lethargic and unfocused.

Typically, I used to . turn to my trusted friend and saviour coffee, but I have been trying to avoid coffee after midday as I am more acutely aware of the negative impact it can have have on sleep.  Using natural remedies such as exercise make sense but essentially my brain needs a stimulating fuel that perhaps isn't so toxic. On reflection, although I have said breakfast, coffee, lunch, gym and sleep are off limits in general as broad concepts, I would be prepared to look at these factors more closely to see how best I can manipulate them to improve performance.

It is the time taken to achieve peak performance as well as the time kept within this peak range that I am more interested in as well as its enablers and detractors.

Also, I would like to mess with the peak, to maybe have the peak more than once per day and to have it earlier in the day. Also, I would like to stay in the think freely zone for longer or be there more often – more like the ideal curve than the current curve. I think living a healthy lifestyle would improve all areas of my day. Go to bed early, get up early – eat regularly and eat healthily. Have fixed times of work and fixed times of relaxation. I don't need any add on or any tool to have a better experience of my day – I just need to get my shit together and focus more.

In general, my biggest concern is eating properly. I know how to change this, I'm just too lazy to go shopping, to cook, to prepare meals I can eat throughout the day etc.

I smoke, because I enjoy it and because it gives me time to think. I could as well eat an apple, but I like the process of rolling a cigarette and the process of smoking. I don't like that smoking is bad for my body and I feel the nicotine ""kicking in"".

I don't really know what you're after here, but from my point of view I'm just living an unhealthy life with all the downsides of doing so.

I know what needs to change (as stated above) but I'm just too lazy and it's difficult for me to see the longterm loss although I'm aware of it.

Also, I don't want to be ""dependend"" on a sort of tool or drug to get me going.

I'm not sure if this is of any help but in my eyes, there's only healthy food, regular exercise, fixed times for work, enough sleep and a positive attitude to optimize my life. I don't want to mess with my sleep and I don't want to peak ALL THE TIME – the rest I'm happy to change and mess with and try out differently. Mental clarity  Mental clarity ",Levitate,ENFJ
262618,Kate,Rushton,krushtie33@gmail.com,"1.	I really need to catch up on my emails soon after I wake up. Facebook and all other social media can be removed. I just really need to know if there are any last minute changes/updates or new jobs coming in. 
	2.	I really need midday air and something to drink to get some fresh perspective and to wake up. I spend most of my time glued to my laptop so I need to make this a routine. 
	3.	I really need to make the middle of my day calm and productive. This is around the time I get new requests coming in and new work updates. 
	4.	I really need to stop drinking caffeine by 4 pm, if I can’t cut it out altogether. Otherwise I will struggle to sleep and will be awake in the early hours of the morning. 
	5.	I really need a walk around 9/9:30 pm to reflect on my day, re-focus and to get some time away from my laptop screen. These mini walks really help my mental health and alertness. 1.	I want to leap out of bed in the morning alert and full of positive energy. I am motivated and I am happy. I believe the world is full of possibilities. I don’t want to slowly wakeup anymore hitting the snooze button. I no longer want to be lethargic in the morning. 
	2.	I want to have a rapid increase in productivity before 9 am. I am able to focus and power through a lot of work. This  needs to be more natural and unaided (less coffee, more nature)
	3.	I want to get through my day without a nap. I am starting to look into full-time roles and taking a nap during the day is going to be a problem. 
	4.	I want to fall fast asleep at 10 am. I almost want to crash out with a rapid decline into a deep, refreshing slumber. At the moment I feel like I am in a daze most of the day. I want to be so tired, I am struggling to keep my eyes open while I brush my teeth. 

I want a ritual that applies wherever I am in the world and what opportunities I get in 2020. I want a night time ritual that is less than 10 mins and a morning ritual that help with a rapid burst  of motivation and productivity in the morning and a rapid decline and calm in the evening. If I am totally honest I am happy to try changing anything, but the ones I don’t want to mess with are all about me have a break from my work - having a change of scenery and environment - to get a fresh perspective and feel connected to nature/the world. 

They are also things that could affect my earning potential i.e. if I don’t check my emails I might miss out on a job. 

Also, many of the “don’t want to mess with” areas are areas where I am calm and more focused. 

I want to try new things in areas where I waste time and are unproductive e.g. waking up and going to sleep. Instead of 4-6 hours of doing not very much, I would be writing, reading or doing so much more, and doing something useful with this “dead time”. 

The things I want to change are mostly at the end and start of the day and I feel that if you start off on the right foot and end on the right foot, you have had a good day. The activities I do that I want to change are associated with wasting time, procrastinating and not being outdoors, refocusing and getting a new perspective.

334694,Sam,Roberts,Sam.roberts1@outlook.com,"1. The image of a hot cake, very close up, looking very gourmet
2. Gluten-free, all natural. Add water and microwave for 60 seconds- A piece of cake. 1. Indulgent Me-time
2. Indulgence, feel-good treat
3. I don't like the idea of comforting flavours- it sounds more like i'm eating it after a breakup instead of a treat at the end of my day or as a 'reward'. I would respond more positively to something like 'Decadent treats in four classic flavours' or 'Decadent treats in four delicious flavours'.
4. Watching a movie in the evening - a delicious dessert without the effort. I'm by myself, i'm feeling good but just want to relax, and a sweet evening treat would hit the spot but I don't want to take the time to prepare anything. 1. Plant-forward goodness
2. Plant-based, healthy sounding, but still delicious cake. I also like the 'lifts you up without the gluten or dairy to bring you down' line! I loved freshly baked too.
3. Plant-forward sounds weird, and i associate it with vegetables instead of almonds. I think it would be better if you used all natural or maybe organic?
4. When i wan't a healthy treat in the afternoon - like an afternoon snack to eat with tea during a break or after I get home from work. Alone, feeling fine but want to indulge without guilt. 1. Craving Convenience
2. convenience is a big one- cake can be such a faff to make and I only want one serving.
3. I don't like fleeting moments - i'm not eating this on the run, I'm eating it because i'm too lazy to bake my own cake but I want it fresh.
4. I picture this as something I eat at any time of day, afternoon or night, when I wan't a sweet treat. I'm alone (seems very strange to think about eating this with people), but I just crave some cake-y goodness without wanting to spend the time or effort, and when I only want one serving. I think the simplicity of the image is striking and makes me want dessert - if there was a tagline on it it would be perfect. With food, especially sweets, I am driven by the look of delicious cake, and if I can have that cake whenever I want, then it's a product i'll buy! 1. The image of a baked good, close up.
2. plant-based, all natural baking made simple. 1. Plant-forward favourites
2. Highlighting that they're gluten and dairy free which is so amazing for baking mixes
3. Plant-based instead of plant-forward
4. When I want to bake for a gluten or dairy free friend but don't want to get all the weird ingredients like xanthum gum etc that i'll never use again. I feel happy, im likely baking on a weekend afternoon, either with a friend who is gluten or dairy free or by myself, and I want to be sure I can get it right. 1. Bake together with love
2. The idea that everyone can have classic baked favourites. So many people I know have dietary restrictions and so an inclusive message resonated.
3. highlighting the fact that it covers dietary restrictions more prominently. Gluten free and dairy free, so the whole family can enjoy.
4. I would bake this for a party or for a big group of friends so I can be sure i'm including everyone. Likely a morning or afternoon, and i'm excited to use a product that I know will produce a delicious result without all the hassle of gluten and dairy free alternatives. 1. Fuss Free favourites
2. Fuss free- gluten and dairy free baking requires so many substitutes that I don't know how to use properly, so the idea that I can make something delicious without a fuss is great.
3. Highlighting that they're gluten and dairy free, so its extra inclusive for those with restrictions.
4. So many situations, baking for myself and friends, even just to have around the house for my gluten-free housemate. I would typically bake by myself but share the result with friends, but I don't want to buy all the substitutes and waste time on a recipe I don't know will work. 1. I like the idea of showing all the wild substitutes that you would need to make a gluten and dairy free recipe from scratch, and then compare it with a box of the mix - no fuss, delicious results.
2. more explanation as to how it's dairy free? Flavour options?
3. Same as previous activity. 1. A close up image of a moist and freshly baked muffin, bursting with berries.
2. plant-based, flavourful muffins, gluten and dairy free 1.Muffins made easy
2.  Fuss free is a big one with the gluten free mixes. I don't want to mess around with xanthum gum and gluten free alternatives only to come out with a flat dry muffin. 
3. Instead of almond flour i would say gluten free and maybe put almond flour down lower.
4. I picture myself making these on a sunday so that my friends and I can eat them throughout the week when we're on the run, or just want a snack in the middle of the day. I would probably eat them alone as a snack, but I could also picture eating them with a friend on a weekend. I would actually make the muffins on my own on the weekend or on a free weeknight. 1. a quality start to your day
2. California-grown, the idea of protein fibre and good fats in a muffin makes me feel like it's more than a carby breakfast
3. I would put superfood more prominent, and add in high protein or gluten free to the first line to differentiate them.
4. I'm grabbing a muffin on my way to work after working out. I feel healthy and energetic and i want something healthy, delicious and easy to carry for breakfast. I make the muffins on a weeknight or weekend day. 1. Plant forward mornings
2. I like the idea of a healthy, plant-based breakfast that's easy to grab and go.
3. I don't like plant-forward - it makes it sound like it will taste like plants. I like plant-based, but I think it would be better with some of the language from the quality mornings one.
4. I'm on the go and want an easy snack for work, breakfast, or for after work if I don't want a full meal. I'm by myself, in a rush, and want something that I can take with me. 1. I love the idea of a high protein muffin with lots of fruity goodness. 
2. I think the flavours are important. I picture muffins bursting with berries and fruit and nuts but i might also picture a dull dry bran muffin, and so the description of taste is important.
3. I would indicate the same ad as activity 1.1 for the same reason. 1. Plant forward favourites - plant-forward lifestyle. Part of a healthier plant-based lifestyle.
2. Plant-based instead of forward. I also think adding in language about the flavours would be useful here. I also don't like the use of almond flour foods - it makes them sound really floury and dry.
3.  almond flour breakfast bars, almond flour puddings, a wider range of almond flour baking mixes. 1. natural goodness of california almonds. Superfood.
2. maybe almond flour based products or foods? I think I like products because they are 'processed' in a way, and they're not entirely flour. Alter the title to introduce other products beyond just almonds- it made me think that you were just advertising their almonds.
3. n/a 1. From Orchard to table - I love the all natural, ethical, sun-soaked imagery.
2. Again, it's not clear until later that it's advertising a range beyond almonds until later on, especially in  the second part. I prefer 'enjoy the natural, sun-soaked goodness of almonds in a wide variety of new almond-flour based products, sourced from our california almond orchards...'
3. Crumble baking mixes, other fruit forward baking recipes, doubling down on the natural farm to table theme. I think that the launch should be very image heavy, showing how delicious the end products appear. Using talking points about all natural, protein rich, fuss free, that will get across the message that the products are easy to use, nutritious and delicious.",Hollywood,ENFJ
334758,Genevieve,Toussaint,genevievetoussaint78@gmail.com,"1. I think close up shots of fudgy, melty cake would get me to take notice! Complete with the almond flour health push. I want a healthy treat that is chocolately and delicious. 
2. Melty, fudgey, chocolately goodness made with low-carb almond flour and the highest quality chocolate
2. Low-carb, high quality 1. Naughty but Nicer
2. I like the word indulgent a lot. It conveys a high quality treat without hammering in the word quality which is overused. I also like the word rich because I want my desserts to be very rich! Also like nourishment, it makes me feel like I am eating something nutritious!
3. It's a little repetitive, repeats nourishment and indulgent 2x. I REALLY liked my #1 and #2 concepts, so I would want #3 to incorporate one of those (plant-based, not weighing you down). 
4. This one is the ""sexiest"" of the concepts, I feel like I would be wrapped in velvety sheets in a bed eating the TLC, I'm alone since the TLC is the ""sexy"" part of this situation, it's probably 9 or 10pm before bed, maybe watching a movie or reading a juicy book! I feel like a TLC because I'm treating myself after a nice bath! Oh, also it would be delicious in the bathtub, ha! 1. Great taste without the waste
2. unnecessary Waste, perfectly portioned. I like that it reminds me that it's a perfect healthy portion for me.  I also hate wasting food, but obviously as someone who's health-conscious I don't want to eat an entire cake, so if I bake goods, a lot of times some of them go to waste which really bothers me! So this appeals to me as a way to majorly cut back on wasted food. 
3. I really like it ! I don't think it needs changing. 
4. This one gives me more mom vibes, even though I am not a mom. It's more like brightly lit kitchen than bedroom. Maybe it's a mid-afternoon snack out on the deck when you're craving a treat but don't want to bake anything. 1. Plant forward goodness
2. lifts you up without bringing you down! I love that. Plant-forward cake makes me feel like it's really healthy, but since it's a cake it won't be gross-healthy 
3. I don't like the last line- I don't think you need to talk about what you are ""Not"" again. I think instead you could say, made with highest quality, nourishing almond flour to keep you going.
4. Definitely outside on a patio! Esp because of the plant verbage I think this would be a situation where I would heat it up in my kitchen and enjoy it outside on a fall night, maybe while the kids are playing in the autumn leaves at dusk . 1. Overall, I think you need to combine 1, 2, and 3- Plant, keeping you up instead of weighing you down, and nourishment. 
2. No, I really like the concepts. 
3. I've attached an ad for a strawberry cake tea. It's a cake that looks like a mug. It reminded me of this product since it's a cake in a cup. Would be cool to have something visually appealing and unqiue. 1. I want it to be low cal or low carb, so an ad highlighting a plate of pancakes for X amount of calories would entice me. Also interested in how almond changes the flavor 
2.  Reimagine home baking with nourishing, plant-based almond flour that gives more flavor with less gluten/dairy/carbs 1. Quality you can trust. 
2. I only liked the phrase the ""almond people"" and ""with a healthy twist"". This one is very ""just ok"" to me, it doesn't really say anything unique. An almond is an almond, i don't know if there are high quality almonds
3. I just don't like the ""quality play"" in general anymore for marketing, unless the product really needs to be quality
4. Baking pancakes in the kitchen with my family, healthy weekend breakfast that is still exciting 1. Tasty treats to share
2. Share, bring joy, freshly baked favorites. I like the rhyme, show you care with baking mixes made to share. 
3. I don't think it needs to say ""closest friends"". Just friends. That just struck me as odd. 
4. At a backyard party, like a BBQ, bringing a plate of cookies or cake that you baked, able to be eaten by everyone even those with gluten allergies! 1. Plant forward favorites
2. I loved this one for the TLC too. It just makes me feel like it'd be entirely guilt-free to eat, since it's plant-based. Feels very healthy. I LOVE the phrase lifts you up without bringing you down!
3. I love it, no changes needed.  
4. Outside in nature, enjoying delicious muffin or baked good, and able to go exercising after or just keep going vs taking a nap or feeling bad about eating a cake. I just really like the plant-based, nourishing wording that a couple concepts have pulled from. I want a guilt-free baked good and even thouhg this may have same calories as flour, definitely tricks me into thinking it is healthier. 1. Hmm. I think the blueberry muffin is very overdone and everyone knows EXACTLY what that tastes like so your standard muffin isn't going to pull any weight here. I almost think you need to throw in a unique ingredient here. It would catch my foodie eye as something new and interesting, and I would be compelled to buy the almond flour for the recipe because I know that the almond flour to regular flour conversion can be tricky. I get a LOT of my recipes off Instagram, and the ones that catch my eye are unique ingredients. Banana oatmeal coconut muffins, or maybe grapefruit poppy seed. I feel like rhubarb is trendy again. 
2. Nourishing, flavorful (insert flavor) muffins that can keep you full until lunchtime!
2. Not your average dry blueberry muffin- take things up a notch with Blue Diamond Almond Muffin Mixes! 1. muffins made easy
2. I hated #4 and #5, so this one was just ok to me. l just don't really get it- muffin mixes are always easy. It's always add egg and water or oil. This wouldn't get my attention because I don't believe muffin mixes can be made easier than they already are. 
3. Sorry, i think the entire concept of easy muffins is just not appealing at all, so I think this one is lost on me. I don't think this 1. a quality start to your day
2. people love starting something off right- the year, the week, so why not the day! It makes them feel like they are set up for success. That is why i liked this concept. Though, i noticed it used the word superfood. I think that word is overused and done.
3. Get rid of supefood. I would also even further lay out the idea that youre starting the day off right, like a new years resolution!
4. I wake up early in the morning, I make a little lemon water and drink it and put on workout clothes and go on an early morning run. after that, I get the muffin mix out and pop the muffins in the oven while I shower after my run. Then I sit down with a coffee and enjoy a delicious fresh muffin! I earned it, and it's healthy and keeps me full til lunch 1. bake now, enjoy later.
2. People love meal prepping- it's all over instagram. saves time, makes eating healthy more convenient. this reminds me of meal prepping and makes it sound very easy and doable to create healthy breakfast for yourself
3. you can even use the words meal prep if you want in this concept- in case people aren't getting it already. you meal prep for lunch, why not for breakfast?
4. I am in a rush in the morning, on my way out the door to my job. If the muffin was frozen, I'm asusming i popped it in the fridge the night before. So i grab it out of the fridge, bring to work, make my morning coffee, and enjoy at my desk. Not super glamorous or anything, but realistic. you could even play off the dreamy ""coffee/newspaper/breakfast at your natural light apartment"" by being like THIS is what most peoples breakfast actually looks like, let's be realistic! 1. My first place concept- the bake now, enjoy later meal-preppy one, could be a bunch of short-cut clips together of a rushed and hectic morning. Could show you grabbing the defrosted muffin and after busy commute, train delay, sitting down to desk and finally breathing and eating the muffin. 
2. This is a digital ad for daily harvest meals. It was a collection of real people recording themselves in their homes/gym and explaining why they love the product. Felt real and more personal Better for you, better for our growers
1. i like the word cooperative, I see what you're going for here. It makes it sound like a small business/little farm that you are supporting. I definitely think this would work with people and makes them feel like they are buying from a farmer's market or something. 
2. Don't think we need to say ""brought to you with love.""
3. Bread mixes. People love making breads at home right now. Maybe almond flour crackers, almond flour popcorn. fast fixes 
1. This was one I had sort of created in my head as well. I love that it's sort of bridging the gap between ready-made things and healthy things. A lot of times I open my fridge and see uncooked broccoli and then I see Cheez-its in my pantry and just opt for fast instead of healthy. This is a good inbetween!
2. You could even provide a visual to the above experience I just described ,where you consider cooking from scratch and consider chips and then reach for the almond mix.
3. Definitely think frozen meals or even vaccum sealed fridge meals would be great. plant-forward
1. this one has been my favorite from the beginning. I love plant-forward, makes me feel like I am eating a salad without having to. And I love love ""lifts you up without bringing you down."" makes me feel like i am eating something LIGHT and that i am LIGHT!
2. Love this one as is.
3. This was great for the cake in a mug mix because that's probably the least healthiest item we've seen, but it definitely makes me feel like I could eat the cake and not be ""brought down"" No, I really think you guys have hit several nails on the head and there are a couple ways to go. But I personally love a combination of Fast Fixes and the phrase ""lifts you up without bringing you down""",Hollywood,
334691,Kirsten,Riccardi,kirstenriccardi@gmail.com,"1. I would take notice if the cake in a cup was aesthetically pleasing and clearly made in a microwave safe sustainable mug! They seem perfect for a picnic gathering or a rainy day movie night. Super easy and great for people who live in studio apartments with a limited kitchen. There are a lot of “in-law” apartments in San Francisco without full kitchens which can make you imagine it to be a “bachelor” studio with less regard for that homey feeling you get baking cookies. I think the TLC sounds like a great way to cheer up a small space without all the cleanup. Plus TLC to me refers to tender loving care. Great concept.

2. Celebrate yourself with a healthy and hassle free cake baked in seconds!
    For the small wins that feel big, microwaveable tasty little cups fill my heart!
    To my friends who thought I couldn’t bake! Take a tasty little cup for the road :)
     Three cheers for Tasty Little Cups, the mini microwaveable morsel made by me. 1. Naughty but nicer.
2. Nourishing treat!!
3. Human high value treat. I have a dog so the term “high value” comes up a lot when referring to treats for good behavior. Also the term “reward”. I think I would like to reward myself more often with nourishing high value treats. Energy bombs!
4. After winding down in the evening and ready to watch some Netflix. I’d love to pop a TLC in the microwave and have a little reward for myself. A reward that won’t make me feel too guilty and also keeps the portion limited in a fun way. If a family member is around to join me then I could easily make a cup for them as well :) Also, afternoon coffee by myself with a TLC could be a great way to conjure some energy for the second part of the work day and feel like I gave myself a little secret lift. Finally, I can easily imagine making these with my four year old niece as a healthy treat activity! We love to watch things grow, so this concept is so much fun for both the child and the child within you. 1. Great taste without the waste.
2. I just realized now that the way I interpreted that was the packaging being compostable. Now I understand it to be about the portion size and not having a whole cake that would be wasted. Still, I do lean into an idea of individual portions because I have often baked a cake and wished I hadn’t eaten it all! It would be wonderful if the package could be composted or at the very least minimal amounts of plastic please! That is one of my big hesitations on individual portions- the plastic waste.
4. I’m home in the late afternoon doing some chores and wrapping up my work day. I’m waiting for my partner to get home but feeling a little hungry for something special. Luckily I can have a TLC and not spoil my appetite for dinner plus we won’t have a surplus of baked goods tempting us to overeat. Score!

Or, a classic midnight snack ;) 1. Craving convenience.
2. Delicious in 60 seconds.
3. Reminds me of the end of a dinner party and you ask, “Coffee?Tea? Cake?” Except this time you can pop a TLC in the microwave and have a portion made for a guest just like that. So convenient and so flexible. On that note I think there could be a slightly more sophisticated design for the cup. More stark colors like black and white with a plum purple. 
4. I imagine it’s early afternoon and I’m going to visit my 93 year old aunt for a quick hello. I realize I don’t have anything fun to bring over so I grab a TLC. I hand it over and give her instructions. She disappears for a few minutes and returns to the front porch with a smile on her face holding the TLC and then I laugh with joy and say “bon apetit!” before I drive away. 1. I think TLC is a great concept. I appreciate interactive experiences like scavenger hunts and classic video games. What if there was a fun way to gain coupons?  I imagine a MS PAC MAN style app or ad campaign that involves a Memoji that can eat as many blue diamonds in 60 seconds to win a free TLC. The element of surprise is always fun, maybe a fun fact under the lid to read while you wait. Maybe things that are made in 60 seconds or unexpected world records associated with 1 minute.

2. I do wonder about the plastic packaging aspect to these individual portions. I hope they can be as minimal as possible!

3. Interactive Content and Shoppable posts!
Like a silly quiz i.e. “What kind of cake are you?”
The shareability increases brand awareness :)
https://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes/food

On Instagram there are shoppable posts that definitely get me clicking. I end up perusing websites and buying, especially when there is a deal of some kind, a sale or promotion to complete the transaction. Also, in terms of just getting the idea out there, I have been ordering food delivery more often these days. I order poke bowl quite often and they include a free dessert with my purchase. If there was a way to partner with local restaurants to include TLC, it might spread the word on them and get people to buy them next time at the grocery store. 1. I would respond to words that help me believe that almond flour baking is better for myself and the planet. I would be pleased to see an image of the baked goods cut in half to expose the rich and moist texture of a delicious baked treat. I also think it helps to promote the fact that consuming almonds supports a way to create energy, one handful at a time.

2. Bake like you can see your future self and couldn’t be happier.
    Forward movement is the best movement, let almond flour take you there.
    Allow it to be easy.
    News flash! Jack’s beans turned out to be ALMONDS after all! 
    Giant in the sky bakes almond bread for the gods! 1. Fuss free favorites
2. For me this was like an introductory choice to use almond flour baking mixes. Like when you go to a restaurant for the first time and you order a classic staple to test run what the kitchen can do. It feels like a smaller commitment that should give someone a chance to experience the new flavor and benefits of almond flour cooking without added complications.
3.  Training wheel treats. 
      A is for Almond, B is for Baking.
      Favorites with a facelift :)

Note- this is in fact a baking mix and not an already baked item correct?

4. These easy baking mixes seem appropriate for when you’re going away for the weekend to the cabin in the woods where you don’t necessarily have all the added ingredients. You crave the home baked goods but have limited resources. I could certainly see myself grabbing a quick pumpkin bread mix for the weekend and waking up before my partner to fill the house with that good old baking smell! Then enjoying it together over coffee. Definitely a great getaway comfort food. 1. Quality you can trust.
2. Once you trust a brand, you become a loyal customer. If you feel like the company creates delicious products AND respects their employees it is a major plus. I know I didn’t rank this concept very high on the previous activity for TLC but as I explore my shopping patterns and lifestyle choices, I have concluded that I very much repeat buying from trusted brands. “Family-owned” is great, especially if employees can have equity in the company as well, to extend the “family”. I also responded well to “healthy twist” made me think of a cinnamon twist made with almond flour!
3. Things like, join the family of almond people. Or, for the California sunshine in your heart.
4. Baking is a stress relieving activity for me. So I could imagine making a Blue Diamond baked good to give myself a simple task with tangible rewards. For the times when things in life are confusing or convoluted, baking is simple, straightforward and guaranteed to give you a boost in confidence. I can imagine the end of a work day, gloomy weather, and the impulse to bake as a pick me up. Plus, you have leftovers for the morning to grab on your way out so it feels productive! 1. Plant-forward favorites
2. Classic —-> alternative. Nourishment that lifts you up. I was curious about gluten and dairy maybe bringing me down. These word choices worked really well for me. I think a lot of people are beginning to question whether or not they are gluten intolerant or lactose intolerant. These baking mixes are a great way to test it out and see for yourself, yet staying within the familiar classic recipes.
3. Plant-forward doesn’t really appeal to me. Makes it feel like a wheatgrass shot, almost too healthy and so potentially with a taste that doesn’t pair well with sweet baked goods. With plant based burgers these days I just don’t really love the concept of the term plant-forward. Protein-forward is more appealing to me. Wheat is a plant as well, so I don’t really experience the difference almond flour really can make. Power-forward also resonates with me.
4. It’s a Monday. I’m feeling a bit lethargic from the weekend of outside the home food sources. I want to get back on a healthy track for the week AND I’m feeling curious about starting a food journal to observe my moods and energy levels. Boom! Blue diamond baking mix is a perfect alternative trial that could very well end up being a permanent contender. Like in boxing- eating cake made with gluten might be like boxing without gloves. Put on the gloves for more power in your punch. 1. I think the power of the almond can be emphasized, even to an extreme like the commercial below. I could imagine a commercial of someone carrying a baked good out of their home and walking it through their neighborhood to grandmas house. Everyone starts to follow the smell- it’s magnetic and maybe even magical! By the end of the commercial there is a crowd of people at grandmas doorstep all waiting to see her take a bite. Maybe a grandma like the woman in the Adam Sandler movie The Wedding Singer. They are all frozen and watching her and then snap! She cartwheels down the front stairs and stands with an energetic grin.  Then it cuts to all her regular flour being sprinkled out her window like snow to make room for the almond flour baking mixes by blue diamond being delivered to her door. Just an idea!

This ad I thought was a fun way to show the extreme power of a snack with some humor. Like a secret weapon, almonds can be seen as fuel for humankind.

There are stories I know about people in southern Italy who were poor and couldn’t afford flour so they would be forced to grind off the edges of a wall in their home to add to the flour in order to bake bread. It’s very tragic that people have less than what they need for nourishment. Almond flour is a richly satisfying source of protein and nutrition, available for all. I think what’s beautiful about it is the concept of a new way of living. Hopefully we can all take care of eacother through better food models that can help achieve overall quality of life. On that note, quality of life starts with the quality of your cupboard eats! 1. I’m a mini muffin maniac. I always feel drawn to mini portions because they seem less indulgent and of course they have that cute factor. The big difference I find between homemade muffins and store bought muffins is the texture of the muffin top. I really prefer a crumble top than a soft sticky top. I would lean in if I saw a good cinnamon crumble muffin, a juicy blueberry muffin or my absolute favorite, lemon poppyseed. It would be really fun if you could potentially have a variety pack to buy.

2. Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes, a tasty revolution.
    Avoid the muffin top waistline with healthy Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes!
    You’re nuts, did you say ALMOND FLOUR EASY MUFFIN MIX!?
     Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes, for energy all day and sweet satisfaction.
     The more the merrier- Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes for every family.
     Be good to your friends, bake them Blue Diamond. 1. Bake now, enjoy later.
2. This concept is great because it gives you permission to be spontaneous and fulfill a craving AND prepare for the week! It feels like a double win and I think that’s fantastic. It allows you to have a muffin now and then toast some up later. Like a squirrel stores nuts for the winter, it’s very sweet and practical.
3. Smart muffins save you time. On-the-go is all-you-need! Grab an extra one for a friend because you care. I usually shy away from freezing things if I can help it, so that part doesn’t appeal to me. Muffins are meant to have fresh or enjoy days after, so I think I’m more inclined towards a bread box concept.
4. I imagine it’s late Sunday evening and I want an activity (and a snack). I’m alone watching Netflix and figure I can multi task. I bring my iPad to the kitchen and grab the muffin mix, diving right into some stress relieving baking plus meal prepping. I sneak one muffin before bed and don’t feel guilty about it because they’re made with quality ingredients with nutritional value! 1. Bake together with love
2. “Create shared moments and healthier food habits”. Yay!
3. “That the whole family can enjoy” could be changed to “ that will energize your family” or “that helps your family grow”. Spark fun into your family with Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes. Show Love, Bake Together.
4. I can imagine it’s Saturday morning and I’m gathering some things to bring over to my brother’s house because I’ll be spending time with my nephew and niece today. My brother has type II diabetes, which means he needs to be conscious of his diet, especially in regards to sugar. My niece Lucia loves to bake so it’s a no brainer choice to grab Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes. We not only can bake them together but we can enjoy them as a family knowing they are nutritious, plus pack some up as a gift to the new neighbors. Baking with your family is a wonderful way of teaching lessons about math, science and generosity. Especially during these times where parents are filling in as school teachers- this is a great way to exercise skills & awareness. 1. A Quality Start to your Day
2. Superfood! Kick start! Start your day right.
3. I think the last sentence is a bit too wordy. Energizing fat, fiber and protein without the carb overload fuels the rocket in you!
Cut the carbs down and add some quality almond flour, lifting you to higher goals each day.
4. New Years Day. You want to make some changes that will last. You want to set yourself up for SUCCESS. So, you evaluate a transition in your life that’s easily maintained. It’s really not a big commitment to try a wholesome food that has amazing health benefits. A benefiting diet, a highly rewarding energy source with all the gushy comfort food satisfaction. Plus it’s EASY. Life gets complicated but making muffins surely should not be. Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes, super friendly food. As a fan of alliteration, the idea of Maximum Muffins, or Muffins to the Max catches my attention. Muffins normally have a connotation of being indulgent and fatty unless they’re a bran muffin. The exciting concept of Blue Diamond Muffin Mixes for me has to do with family, community, and nutrition alongside the warmth and comfort of homebaked goods. A great substitute for pancakes that must be eaten on the spot, muffins can be creatively packaged for a picnic the following day with loved ones. Kids need to start healthy eating habits young, and by eating nutritional baked goods they can expand their palette and really be ahead of the curve. The terms that have to do with starting your day right are memorable. The terms that have to do with creating new healthy eating habits are also valuable. Flexibility and adaptability are extremely rewarding because they illustrate an open mind. We all can be less stubborn about what we consider a treat when we highlight the power of almond flour.

Powerful almond flour to give you strength and comfort. The Titans tv show is about powerful athletes in competition. They speak about being bold, fearless, excited, young and old. Food is fuel and it should always taste good. It’s empowering to know that you can have some control over your moods. Eating quality almond products can pave a path for a healthy home.



Here is a popeye the sailor man clip-https://youtu.be/7zrRlMGeBes

Here is a Titan Games clip- https://youtu.be/TCOlZ2TZHFY 1. Faster Fixes. “Satisfaction of home cooking”. “Quality food that’s fast”. Again, the easy baking mix feels like a solution to a challenge. You want to bake but you don’t want it to take too long and be over complicated.
2. Weekend Escapes. I think gearing it more towards a quick and easy thing to bake when away for the weekend or simply outside of your own home. You could even figure out a camping baking mix to make over the fire! I saw an ad where people made muffins in the hollowed out oranges they ate. They filled the rind with batter and wrapped them in tin foil. Then placed them on the hot coals and they made muffins!
3. Cast Iron Cookie. Pre cut Toastables. Mini Pies. 1. Powered by the Almond. “Natural goodness”. “Superfood that adds a nutritious boost”. I leaned into this concept because it clearly communicates the power source of almonds and the nutritional value.
2. Eating better starts with almonds. The superfood that boosts your nutrition in every bite. Almond energy makes a smile into laughter.
3. Powdered Power Donuts. Cakewalk. Tea Cake O :boxing_glove: 1. From Orchard to Table.”Sun soaked goodness”. “Family growers”. “Made exclusively”. The reference to sunshine is great! Family is always a great term to use, especially if it branches out to your chosen family. Saying it’s made exclusively is strong because it feels special and pure...important that it’s not a mixture from other sources. Perhaps add “100%”.  I always lean in when I hear about eating locally grown food. It’s not only beneficial to your health but it promotes community building and helps create a thriving social network. My college was very driven towards sustainable agriculture and I learned that eating local honey was the absolute best for your body. It also fosters a sense of pride within your community which can help boost confidence and positive energy.

2. Welcome aboard could be a term that might allow people to feel invited to this new wave of healthy and prosperous living. Whole food ingredients is a bit vague to me...  if you want to discuss the ingredients being unprocessed but still carefully combed through you could use terms like patiently selected or never stripped of natural benefits. Loved the way they are. I think sometimes people shy away from the idea of eating healthier because they assume it won’t taste as good. There are certain connotations health foods can bring to mind. Tasting like cardboard, being too grainy, too seedy, not fluffy enough. Or for example the fig is a fruit that a lot of people may not have tried before or think they don’t like. Fig Newton is a total success. The rectangular box is easy to recognize and the simple ingredients make it a great crossover cookie. I think recognizing the healthy option as the tastier choice, then the Blue Diamond almond flour-based products will win us over. Also, the tollhouse cookie log (also Pilsbury made it too) is a smart in between option for fuss free baking. I personally do not go into the frozen food aisle for more than ice cream and occasionally Eggo Waffles. Toastable options could be great for people who want an on-the-go option that’s not as processed as Eggo Waffles and Toaster Streudels or Pop Tarts. Savory options could also be of interest to me! Blue diamond has very creative flavors which I appreciate, though if I were new to almond flour based baked goods I would want to first try a classic to make sure I was satisfied with the product texture. Blue diamond almonds are a staple on our road trips and picnics so I think focusing on the portable adventure energy source is appealing. Thanks!",Hollywood,
252388,Sachie,Uchimaru,suchimaru@gmail.com,"1. The packaging, it would have to be visually appealing and make me think that it's going to be good for me (healthy) as well as tasty. 
2. A fast, easy and tasty snack for you and your family that is also so healthy! Naughty but nicer 

1. It wasn't as eye catching as the top 2, but I felt like it was still a very unique phrasing so it was eye catching. 

2. Naughty is what was eye catching. i would actually wouldn't say it was positive, it made me actually have a negative connotation since when I think of naughty foods I think I should avoid them. The nicer part didn't off-set it enough for me.

3. I would take out either reduce the ""naughtiness' of the first word, something more like ""indulgent"", and/or make the second word more positive (like ""healthy"" or ""good for you"")

4. I would be with my 6 year old who has an insane sweet tooth, and I don't have the time or headspace to bake him anything. It would be a fun activity to do with him for a snack. I would be in the kitchen. I would feel happy that i am being a ""good mom"". It would be around 4pm on a wednesday. I am with my 6 year old. Great taste without the waste 

I noticed the waste part, because you don't usually associate that with food. So it made me stop and think, what is being wasted? And then I got it that you would actually use less dishes to make this instead of a cake from scratch, hence reducing water waste! I thought that was very clever.

I actually don't think I would change this at all. I like how it rhymes, and I like the waste word a lot.

I would still feel like I would be making this with my 6 year old for an easy snack for him, but this one also makes me think I can encourage my 12 year old to make this for himself for his snack. He is at the age that he can make his own snacks but he always makes a mess, so this would be easier for him to reduce the clean up and also for me Plant forward goodness

I definitely noticed this the most because of the strong association with plant-food (aka almond). This would make it stand out amongst all the other baked goods, making you take a second look and wonder what is plant forward. The word I noticed was ""plant forward"". 

I may change the goodness word. It's not exactly a strong positive word. Too generic maybe. Maybe changing it to something more like ""plant forward wellbeing"" or ""indulgence""

I see myself eating this as part of a healthy eating lifestyle. I did not imagine my children with this concept. I am at home, maybe even with a glass of wine after dinner after the kids have gone to bed. I am by myself having some self care time, wanting to unwind after a long day. 1. I think pushing more the almond part of your product is key. You need to distinguish this from all the other brownie and cake mixes out there, and your product is unique in the almond aspect. 

2. I don't think so

3. There is an instagram account from Japan called kurashiru that has AMAZING ads of their foods. The pictures are really really appealing, and they have short videos on how to make them. Their account is the best I've come across in making their foods look appealing. I almost always click on them! 1. It would have to appeal to my healthy eating routine. I would 150% skip an ad for a baking mix without it because I am staying away from calorie rich things like that right now, especially with shelter in place! 

2. A healthy plant-based alternative to baking mixes Bake together with Love 

I noticed the ""love"" word, you usually don't see that in a food ad. I also noticed the ""together."" It made me immediately imagine baking with my kids.

I think it does not make you realize that it is a gluten free alternative at all. I would definitely add in those words, also words to imply it is healthier alternative.

I am at home, baking with my kids (6 year old) who are hungry, and I whip this out to do as a fun activity together. It is a weekend since it will take some time. probably snack time (late afternoon).I am excited because it is going to be an activity to do with my child and also proud that it is healthier than normal cake.  I feel ike the blue diamond mix because it is healthier alternative than a regular Dunken hines baking mix. 1. Fuss free favorites 

2. I noticed the word ""fuss"", because that's a unique word to put in a food ad, and that it was ""fuss free"" appealed to me because i'm a busy working mom now with two kids staying home with me all day!

3. I again think this is missing out on the health benefits that people would be interested in, the fact that it s plant based and made from almonds is completely lacking from the ad. 

4. Same as the first one, I'm home with my kids who are bored and hungry, and i whip this out to do as a fun activity to do with them. I am happy and proud of myself that I can offer them somethign that will make them happy but also has less ""bad for you"" ingredients. 1. Plant forward favorites 

2. The word ""plant forward"" because it makes me think this is different from al the other baking mixes out there, all of which I immediately assume are super unhealthy and bad for you. 

3. I think it's pretty good, maybe make the ""favorites"" part a little more interesting. What is it a favorite for? What makes it special? Maybe replacing it with words that talk about how delicious it is despite being healthy with the plant based aspect, something like indulgent

4. I can suddenly see this product being fancy enough to bring to an adult party, with the branding of ""plant forward"". It will be a talking point and people would think it's ""cool"" as opposed to me bringing a Dunken Hines brownie--which would be totally ""uncool"" because of how unhealthy it is AND its from a box . 1. I would really highlight the healthy aspects of this product that make it different from the other baking mixes. Plant based, almond is a BIG health food right now so really pushing that word more forward.

2. See number 1

3. The instagram ads that I often find myself compelled to click on are ones that have some alluring color (pastel colors somehow seems to imply more healthy), some sort of discount attached, and of course the food looks really good. There is also some tagline that catches your attention. With instagram the ones with videos are also more eye catching than a still ad . Today I saw one for Blendjet that was very eye catching because it's a video and the health benefits are obvious, plus they made it look so easy and you can immediately tell that since they demonstrate for you in video how easy it is to use it 1. A video versus a picture since it catches your eye more, maybe someone really skinny and wholesome looking, maybe with a child. Really pushing forward the almond flour portion, and the health benefits. Something has to really set it apart from the typical baking mix box 

2. A plant-based baking mix to make indulgent snacks while staying healthy! 1. A family breakfast 

2. Family-- a baking mix I would never use if I didn't have kids. Having kids seems to be a good excuse for not making something out of scratch, because you can do it with them in an easier way and you're pressed for time. I also read the line about ""show them you care"" and that tugged at my guilt strings. Not sure if that's a positive thing, but it did make me notice it 

3. I would add in the part about how it's plant based, and hence healthier, and that's why it shows even more that you love and care about your family. 
I would also add in the part that it can be something you do WITH your family, not just something you do FOR your family.

4. I'm at home, in the morning on a weekend, maybe I woke up earlier than usual and the kids are still asleep. I decide to do something extra nice for everyone and whip this out. I feel excited, maybe I'm going to surprise everyone when they wake up. I feel like a Blud diamond mix beaus i think it's healthier than making muffins from another baking box because of the almond content and it makes me think of protein 1. A quality start to your day 

2. The word ""quality"". It doesn't usually go with a product like a muffin mix box, so I noticed it. It made me think there may be some health benefits. And then the word ""californai grown"" definitely made it seem like it's healthy with the connotation I have of Californias being all skinny and healthy. 

3. I would add in the specific health benefits of almond mix to the ad. Like words like gluten-free or protein.

4. I'm home in the kitchen, also similar to the first one, maybe i woke up a little earlier than the kids. This one though I don't feel as excited, I'm feeling a bit more like on a mission to  cook something healthy for them for breakfast that they will eat. Maybe feeling is more serious. 1. Plant forward mornings.

2. The word ""plant forward"". If that was in an ad for a baking mix i would definitely take notice since it's unusual and it catches your eye, and it makes you think it's healthy. I liked how it said the words ""gluten"" and ""dairy""--dairy specifically because i wouldn't have known that dairy was omitted, and I recently read that dairy is a really big inflammatory thing. 

3. I would add in the word california like in the other ad, and also ad in words like ""indulgent"" and ""healthy"" to emphasize that it's something that's good for you but so delicious. I would also add in the words family because I think moms are the target audience here. 

4. Same as the other ones, I'm alone in the kitchen on a weekend morning, having woken up earlier than everyone else. I'm feeling excited to bake my family something that is healthy for them, and they won't even notice the difference. I'm kind of thinking something like an Impossible burger-- healthier alternative. For a visual ad I think definitely go with short videos--the ads on instagram that I notice are mostly all video. Bright sunlight, skinny people who look healthy and happy, probably with a family. 

I think you will need to come up with some flavors that are atypical, and maybe targeting an audience that is maybe upper middle class, or at least health conscious. Flavors like ""birthday cake"" isn't going to draw this audience. I'm guessing that the price point is going to be higher than Dunken Hines, and for people to spend a little more they are going to have to be drawn to it as a luxury item--and the flavor has a lot to do with that. Flavors like matcha, or lavender, sea salt, etc. 

I noticed an ad for a company called coconutwhisk on instagram today and clicked on it because it used a color scheme that I automatically noticed, and assumed it was a health food. It was something about the soft lighting and the pastel color. Foods that are usually generic and not healthy often have bright colors like bright red or blue. 1. Powered by the Almond. Definitely noticed the word ALMOND that brings your attention to the fact that that is indeed what it is made from. It would seperate it from the other products. Then the word ""power"" also is good because you then think of Almond=protein. Then the longer ad I like words like ""california"", superfood, and nutritious. 

2. I think I would specifically add in words like ""protein"" to make the link more clearer. 

3. Almond protein shakes. Almond flour energy bars. 1. Plant forward favorites. The word ""plant forward' is definitely eye catching because it immediately has a healthy connotation. Then the words of gluten and dairy being mentioned in the longer ad are great because you wouldn't automatically assume that it would be dairy-free as well. Many people are trying to avoid dairy right now because of inflammation. 

2. I would add in more health benefit words like ""protein"". I would keep the california aspect. 

3. Almond flour chips? Almond flour cupcake mixes? 1. Better for you, better for growers. I definitely noticed the ""better for you"" part and liked it because that's what eVERYONE wants now, to be healthy and lose weight if possible. Then I noticed the better for growers and this peaked my interest, so I thought about it for a few seconds. I figure an ad that makes you think about the product is good. Then I read the longer ad to figure out why it would be better for growers, and then was surprised that it is a coop. I thought to myself, they should advertise that more! 

2. I think combining the health conscious concepts from the other ads in with the co-op aspect. Since you're saying ""better for you,"" you would probably want to highlight that a little more. The ad as it stands is all focused on the co-op part. Americans are selfish, they really won't do things unless there are things in it for THEM. (unfortunately) If they can feel better about it with the co-op aspect that helps, but they also need to think there's something beneficial for themselves and their families. 

3. I think a baking mix is perfect for this ad. It helps people get over the guilt of buying something unhealthy like a baking mix I don't think so... I've put in all my thoughts!",Hollywood,ISFJ
225801,Jeanie,Demoss,jsheyngis3@yahoo.com,"1. The ingredient list, why it is food for me. 
2. Grainfreemessfreecupcake. Convenience is the one that I put in 3 place because it is important to have convenience but ingredients and taste are the number one. Convenience, taste, plant based are words that stood out to me. This concept could be improved with different toppings that have different types of benefits. 
I would want to have them while I am at home, feeling like I want something sweet, but nothing that will hold me down and make me feel gross. It is evening time and I am on my own or with my husband. I feel like enjoying something sweet after a long day. I like concept 2 because it talks about nourishing And tasty, being the top 2 important factors of a treat. This concept can be improved if it talked about keeping you more full and energized And having the correct amounts of fiber and such. I would want to enjoy them on the go, with my kids, and at work with coworkers or on my own as a midday snack. I feel confident and excited for my tasty treat. Plant forward is my favorite one because it is truly a guilty free desert. It makes me feel better and lighter when eating gluten and dairy free. This concept can be improved by saying that it is tasty. I feel excited, I am out and about, it is night time, and I am with girl friends and want something sweet and delicious. Someone that feels like running even after having a treat because it is light and doesn’t weight you down. 1. Plant based, high quality almond flour would get me to notice. 
2. #Plantbasednutcakemixes It says exactly what the product is and what it is made out of. 1. I put the sharing concept as my 3rd choice.
2. I like the idea of spending time with family and learning good healthy habits early on. 
3. I would also add that it is filling, and what flavors it might come in to make it more exciting. 
4. I can see myself enjoying it with my kids, at home, feeling joyful and energetic. It is mid day and I want a healthy snack that tastes great and is easy to make everyone's favorite one. I am with the family at home and feeling like having a treat for my hard day. 1. Bake together with love was my 2nd favorite concept. 
2. I liked the family love, the sharing, sharing good ingredients, learning healthy young. 
3. This concept can be improved by giving some examples of what these family favorites are to get us excited and back to our childhood. 
4. I am at home with family, feeling loved and close to each other, after dinner. I feel like making a delicious treat for the family without the long mess. 1. My top concept was the plant based concept. 
2. I took notice because it was the choice that I would go for since it is plant based. I would get my treat but also not feel like I had a cake. Plant based, dairy free, gluten free,  healthy choice are some of the words that made me notice.
3. This concept can be improved by having delicious flavors. 
4. I am at home by myself, after a hard work out class and really need something sweet, it is around 10:30am and I feel like having a healthier but indulging treat. I feel excited and intrieged. It would be good to say that the texture is moist and the flavors that they come in, while still being the healthiest and most convenient cake ever made. 
Can't think of an ad but being transparent about the ingredients that are being used, is very important and how they make you feel after you eat the product. Plant based muffin mix would get me to take notice. 
Plantbasedmuffinyummies I put A family breakfast as 3rd choice. I noticed it because it is a favorite that everyone in the family could really enjoy and I like the idea of eating healthy ingredients with the family. It can be improved by talking a little more why this is a good start to the day. I would want to enjoy them with my family at home, for breakfast, and I want it to be special so I chose a fresh muffin mix. I feel good because it is healthy and delicious and no one can even tell. I chose plant forward as my 2nd concept because it is made with great ingredients and it will make me feel good to start the day. It is light and nutritious. This concept can only be improved by suggesting adding fresh berries. I would enjoy these camping or at home. I am camping with my family and I need a healthy treat that will not make me feel sick in the woods. It is evening time. My first choice was a quality start to your day! I liked that it is a superfood, low in carbs, and high in protein, fiber and good fats. I can only see improvement by talking about the texture because many times gluten free and vegan means dry. I am at home, before going to the gym, at 8am, and I feel like I need something good to get my day started off on the right foot. I am by myself and I feel energetic and eager to start my day. I think that all of these should emphasize that they are gluten free and vegan because that says higher quality and interest to me.  
https://www.pinterest.at/pin/743234744737931881/  I chose this ad because it is easy to see the ingredients and colors, it is transparent and that is what I look in a high quality food item. 1. My 3rd choice is What made me take notice is called powered by the Almond.  I liked natural goodness, superfood, nutritional boost. best quality ingredients, and I love the almond people. 
2. I would add that it keeps you fuller longer, delicious at any time of the day. 
3. Almond flap jacks, waffles, pancakes, English muffins. 1. My second choice is plant forward favorites. I like the phrases it will lift you up without the gluten and dairy to bring you down, plant forward lifestyle. Only thing I would add is the protein factor and how full it will keep you, and how much protein there is exactly. 
2. High in protein, vegan, gluten free, and adding flavors.
3. almond protein shake, almond coffee 1. My first place choice is from Orchard to Table. Whole food ingredients, sun soaked goodness, grown with love by family growers, almond sourced. 
2. Only thing is knowing how much protein is in there and how full it will keep you. I would also mention that it is gluten free and vegan. 
3. Almond drinks that are lightly flavored. My final thoughts are that protein amount needs to keep being pointed out, how full protein makes you feel, that it is vegan and gluten free for the best quality ingredients.",Hollywood,
334670,Rose,Aiello,BIKRAMPHILE@GMAIL.COM,"1- This is the first time I have heard of such a product, or at least, it was last week for the introductory portion of this project. I adore cake, but the idea of microwaving one just never appealed to me. That's not to say I wouldn't try one - maybe it tastes amazing. The Instagram pictures should feature the Tasty Little Cups beautifully decorated with frosting, sprinkles, fruit, plated on fancy China. This would make me think I am looking at the page of a fancy pasticerrie, and entice me to create the same feel at home.

2-No time to bake? Fancy a little treat just for you? Tasty Little Cups made with almond flour-unlike any other! 1-Plant Forward Goodness
2-The title Plant Forward Goodness grabbed me. I like eating ""plant-based"" products such as Impossible and Beyond Meat.
3-The title speaks to Plant ingredients, or at least, that's what I get from the title, but the description only speaks to it being dairy-free. I would like to know if there are any plant ingredients, aside from Almond flour.
4-I'd be at home. It would be later in the day, evening. I'd be feeling peckish- several hours after dinner, maybe around 9 or 10pm. I'd be alone or with my husband. A Tasty Little Cup would be a good choice, because it's portion controlled and the perfect size as to not make me stay awake from a heavy snack. 1-Indulgent Me Time
2-Again, here, the title is what drew me in. Thinking of the size of the cake, it sounds perfect as a snack, specifically just for me, hence, Indulgent ME Time. The last line about ""getting a moment alone to treat myself"", resonated too. During this pandemic, between working from home, e-learning with my kids, I feel like I never get time to myself.
3- I really like this concept as is. The way it is written is perfect for the idea of Indulgent Me Time. Maybe a cheeky little saying at the end, like ""Go ahead, be a little selfish"".
4- I am home, hiding from my family. I am feeling a little secretive. It's early am or at night when everyone is asleep. I am alone, enjoying Indulgent Me Time. I feel like a Tasty Little Cup because I am finally getting some time alone and want a snack that I don't have to share, something just for me. 1-Great Taste Without the Waste
2-The name says it all- I feel great knowing that I am making a small portion that will definitely get consumed. Oftentimes, I make a large batch of something and we don't finish it all before it spoils.
3-The name and description fit perfectly well together. I don't feel the need to change anything here. This fits many situations - a cake for yourself, small cakes for your family members.
4-This feels more universal. I don't only think of myself hiding and enjoying my cake alone. This could also be me making a small cake for each of my family members to enjoy, anytime of the day. It could be an afternoon snack, or dessert after dinner. I feel like a Tasty Little Cup because I want one small snack, or maybe I want to try each flavor, or make small cakes for my kids and husband. 1-I stand by the idea of really dressing up the tasty little cakes with frosting, sprinkles, fruits, on beautiful plates, in a party setting to make them feel gourmet and festive.
2-I like the ideas presented here and don't think anything was missing.
3-Please see the photo below. I chose it because it's dedicated to Mug Cakes and makes them look festive and adorable. 1-I'd really be interested in knowing what plant-based means, specifically. Aside from the high quality almond flour, this would draw me in, because it's the first time I have heard plant-based used to describe baking mix.
2-Plant based almond flour baking mix-add a new flavor profile to all your baked goods, along with added nutrition! 1-Tasty Treats to Share
2-It really spoke to one of the activities my kids and I love to do together-baking. It reminded me of home, creating together and of course, sharing.
3-I like this concept, but I would speak about it being an almond-based flour. I don't see anything indicating that here. 
4-I am in the kitchen with my kids. I am feeling happy because we are doing something together as a family. It is daytime on a weekend. I am with my kids. I feel like trying something new- for nutrition and taste. 1-Plant Forward Favorites
2-The title makes me more interested. I want to know more about what the ingredients are and what makes this plant-based, aside from being made from almonds, which, from this description, aside from seeing ""plant-based"" and knowing the brand, Blue Diamond, I may not really know this is an almond based product.
3-It definitely needs to be more transparent about the ingredients. What does plant-based mean? Also- there is little here, that even indicates that this is made from almond flour.
4-I'm making a cake for my vegan friends. I feel rushed because I probably waited until the last minute to make this cake. It's the morning of the day that I will share this cake with vegan friends. I am alone. I would make this because it states that it is vegan and this would be ideal for the people I have in mind. 1-Fuss Free Favorites
2-Fuss free, the idea of convenience is appealing, as is the detail about highest quality almond flour.
3-I think for this purpose- a convenient product made of high quality ingredients, the title and description fit together well.
4-I'm in my kitchen. I feel like making dessert for my family for after dinner. I feel generous. It's a weekend afternoon. I am alone - the cake is a surprise. I feel like making something new for my family and seeing what they think about the flavor. 1-Like the mug cakes, I would dress this cake up beautifully too. Almond flour sounds healthy (and it is), but healthy food doesn't always evoke delicious thoughts, even though that isn't true.
2-I would just make sure to add the fact that it's almond flour, whichever direction is decided upon. 
3-I chose the photo below, because it speaks directly about cakes made from almond flour and the designs, in my opinion, are beautiful. 1-I would lean in more, if, beyond the fact that it's almond-flour, it came in new flavors I haven't seen before in muffins- like banana/caramel, dulce de leche, pineapple or mango. I'd also like to see very professional pictures of the muffins, in elegant scenes.

2-Bored with your current breakfast muffin options? Now, Blue Diamond offers almond-flour based muffins in new and exciting flavors! 1-Bake Now, Enjoy Later
2-I'm interested in the concept of baking now or freezing for later. I was intrigued because I am not quite sure if they mean, I can bake the muffins and THEN freeze them for a portable breakfast later, or if they meant I could freeze the batter. 
3-To improve this, I would clarify the point of freezing and specify what they meant so it's clear.
4-I am in my kitchen. I feel hungry and ready for breakfast. It's early morning before anyone wakes up. I am alone and making breakfast for my family. I feel like surprising my family with delicious muffins for breakfast. 1-A Family Breakfast
2-It just evoked feelings of family and spending time together. It sounds serene and peaceful.
3-I would write about the flavor varieties these come in, since ""the whole family will enjoy them.""
4-I am home, in my kitchen. I am hungry and ready for breakfast. It's early in the morning. I am the only one awake, so I am alone. I feel like making something delicious for my entire family for breakfast. 1-Plant Forward Mornings
2-I like the idea of starting my day with something made from plants because it makes me think of fruits and vegetables, something I try to include in each meal.
3-Much like the other offerings, I would like to know more about what ""plant-based"", or ""plant-forward"" actually means. Is it only because there is almond flour, or other plant ingredients?
4-I am in my kitchen. I feel hungry and ready for breakfast. It's early am and I am making breakfast muffins for the day since we are all headed back to work and school (in this scenario). I feel like making this so that we have a healthy muffin to take with us as we each go our separate ways. 1-I would definitely make this product in flavors that are not common of haven't been created yet. That would make it even more unique. I know muffins are typically breakfast food and contain fruit, but maybe a savory option would be interesting too.
2-I don't think we missed anything. 
3-I chose this ad because the imagery is cute and thoughtful and makes me stop and look at the page. For 3rd place, I chose Powered by the Almond.
1-I chose this one specifically for the catchy appeal of the slogan. Though it was my 3rd favorite, it is definitely something I will remember. I also like the mention of almonds being superfood.
2-I wouldn't really change anything. The slogan is really catchy and memorable. It also specifically mentions the power behind almonds and Blue Diamond is all things intrinsically almond.
3-We haven't mentioned anything about these, but I think a smoothie made with almond flour would fit this concept. I think of smoothies and superfood or powerfood, fuel. For 2nd place, I chose Better for You, Better for Growers.
1-I like to support brands that support their staff and the members that make the product possible, along with their customers, so this really speaks to me.
2- This is very straightforward and doesn't need to be changed. It;s clear that this concept speaks to idea of everyone benefiting from using this product.
3-This concept makes me think of almond-based teas, as well as almond-based grain bowls. I think of something nurturing and hearty. For 1st place, I chose From Orchard to Table
1- I am a big fan of the whole ""Farm to Table"" movement. I enjoy buying products that make this claim and eating in restaurants that tout locally grown ingredients. I think of these products having not had to travel very far to get to me, and doing less harm to the environment.
2- I think this concept really strikes a high point, as is. I also like how it speaks to the family growers and family owned California almond farms. It sounds like this brand supports small businesses which makes me proud to support them.
3-I think of almond butters or spreads, something wholesome and comforting. Other than really focusing on new flavors and ingredients like unique fruits related to the baking mixes, I love all the concepts I have seen- I love the focus on family farming, supporting small business and convenience.",Hollywood,ISFJ
334985,Mary ,Scinto,marytscinto@gmail.com,"1. Re: Instagram add for Tasty Little Cups: 
1. Q: What would get you to lean in and take notice ? 
    1. a)  image of the product - packaging plastic, bio degradable, re-usable? 
    1. b) Directions on how the product is prepared ( if it says microwave only I wouldn't click on it because I don't have a microwave, hopefully they can make it so you could just add hot water)  
    1. c) Cost of product - is it affordable 
    1. d) Serving size of product- is it for one, does it come in multiples 
    1. e) Shelf life of product, is it refridgerated or shelf stable- does it expire within short time/vs long 
    1. f) Is it branded as healthy- I don't buy things that are desserts but claim to be healthy, feels like manipulative false advertising, it's beneficial *sometimes* to no calorie content. If it claims to be low fat or non-fat and has increased sugar or modification to be ""low fat"" yet higher sugar // other ingredients and changes that still make it ""unhealthy"" yet branded as healthy 
   1. g) Image of product post preparation- what does it look like when it's ready to eat 
    1. h) coloring and lettering - does it catch my attention, is it too overwhelming in design, is the design artistic? usually lean toward simple classic logos or artistic design that looks like an artist did it not just ""branded"" 


2. Re: Instagram add for Tasty Little Cups 
2. Q: Imagine there is a 20 word tagline on the ad...what does it say?
    a. Dessert in minutes, gluten free, almond based, dairy free- ready in minutes! No fail baking for the baker in all of us! 1. 3rd place: Great taste without the waste 
2. Great Taste without the waste, plant forward goodness- is it all plant based or just almonds as the only plant? are there fruits or vegetables or cacao or other things used that are plants because just almonds with sugar/ other non-plant based, highly modified ingredients would be misleading branding 
3. Detail words like compostable, re-usable, what kind of packaging is it? 
4. Enjoy at home, at the end of dinner with a friend for a quick dessert, evening time, home or at a friends, feel like a tasty cup because I want a sweet treat for dessert 1. Plant-forward Goodness (2) 
2. plant forward goodness- is it all plant based or just almonds as the only plant? are there fruits or vegetables or cacao or other things used that are plants because just almonds with sugar/ other non-plant based, highly modified ingredients would be misleading branding 
3. would include potentially the ""plants"" that make it plant forward and anything about sustainable harvesting of them 
4. 4. Enjoy at home, at the end of dinner with a friend for a quick dessert, evening time, watching a show, home or at a friends, feel like a tasty cup because I want a sweet treat for dessert 1. Quality You Can Trust (1) 
2. Quality and trusted brands are always important when buying food, trust is implied by knowing the brand 
3. I don't love that it says you can trust, I think if you didn't make it future or passive voice it's better like Always Quality, or always sustainable. Trust makes it a bit more intense, and what does it really mean to trust a mug cake? A bit about the brand is helpful when illustrating this concept like since 1910 or family owned or employee owned ( think branding like king Arthur flour, jiffy corn muffins) 
4. 4. Enjoy at home, at the end of dinner with a friend for a quick dessert, evening time, home or at a friends, feel like a tasty cup because I want a sweet treat for dessert  
 number 4 is the same answer for everyone? Not sure why it would change. I may not be the best person to answer this, because I am usually aversive to buying any advertised products. 

If there is anything about how they give back to the community or invest funds, sustainable business practices, fair trade, employee owned company, history of company,  anything related to their stance on equality, anything regarding their diversity in the work place, equitable practices related to how their products are made- avoiding certain additives like corn syrup, guar gum etc. Are they avoiding use of plastic, what is the companies status on waste. Do they throw away products unused or donate. Do they have a minimum number of ingredients? can this be of benefit to advertise? 

I don't have any adds to share but branding I like includes 
King Arthur Flour 
I think it's love Chocolates  the packaging includes XOXO and they have quotes on the inside, and they detail the history of the chocolate industry and highlight slavery involved in chocolate trade- all things i really had no idea about that were a great learning experience and made me align with the brand knowing buying the product was contributing to a more equitable chocolate trade. 
 Jiffy corn bread- classic, simple, easy guide/ instructions on baking, recyclable 
Trader Joe's does a good job with variety or branding
The daily table is a non-profit grocery store with a lot of products that have good branding
Classic, simple, same font, not a lot of different sizes. not a giant image of the product, easy to read nutrition label, less than 5-10 ingredients Saying plant based and high quality almond flour feels repetitive, I think baking at home instead of home baking is more engaging. I 'd take notice of how easy it is to make/ what other ingredients are needed, cost, packaging. 
 
Almond based Cake mix for baking at home, only 3 ingredients needed, ready in xyz minutes Fuss free favorites, but I think the last 3 I ranked, Fuss free favorites, Tasty treats to share, and back together with love should all be last place .

The phrasing fuss free reminds me of babies, and i don't think anything cooking should be called fuss free, but perhaps you are branding for a british market and that's a common saying 

I would use other words to describe easy and convenience like fool proof or simple steps 

If i bought the mix, I'd make it at home, with myself, when I want dessert or plan to bring some to a friend or need to bake a cake last minute for something second place is quality you can trust. I didn't like the branding here, it felt very verbose on the power point, when people know a brand and buy it they trust it. Too much highlighting of trust makes people question if they are trustworthy. I don't love that it says you can trust, I think if you didn't make it future or passive voice it's better like Always Quality, or always sustainable. Trust makes it a bit more intense, and what does it really mean to trust a mug cake? A bit about the brand is helpful when illustrating this concept like since 1910 or family owned or employee owned ( think branding like king arthur flour, jiffy corn muffins) 
If i bought the mix, I'd make it at home, with myself, when I want dessert or plan to bring some to a friend or need to bake a cake last minute for something Plant forward food 
Not a lot of baking mixes pride themselves on being plant based, curious what other plants are in here besides almonds that make it plant based. I think that plant forward is an iffy descriptor why not plant based? what about the plants are forward moving. plant filled? Plant based ingredients , made from nature, made of plants. 

I'd eat it in all the same situations said before, pm, at home, when I want to dessert or need to bake something for others, this question feels repetitive! I don't get digital adds for food usually and I rarely click if ever. If a website is booming with adds I won't continue reading. 

I think it should be simple 
to the point 
talk about the ease of product 
not be misleading in language 
not be overly verbose, the power point felt extremely repetitive. Why do you need to say blue diamond is introducing something when blue diamond logo is of course on the packaging or logo. The less word and more iconography the better. Keep the font simple, classic, i think digital adds become overwhelming with so much information, or are too simple and no one knows what is even being sold.

Good luck! 1. The image prepared product, what it requires to make it, cost, ingredients/ allergies 
2. 20 words feels like a lot of words on a little add 
1, 2 ,3 4, 5 ,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
Simple muffin mix for the perfect morning muffins, full of plant based nutrients & home baked love 1.  Plant Forward morning 
2. Plant & morning 
3. I don't love the word plant- forward, I think there is better way to say it like plant based or ingredients from nature 
4. how to enjoy? : home, a breakfast that is special// break up routine, morning time, alone or with company coming, want to make muffins quick and easy 1. Muffins made easy 
2. Muffins, made, easy - the product, that you can make them, that they are easy to make 
3. Easy to Make muffins - active voice more engaging 
4. home, a breakfast that is special// break up routine, morning time, alone or with company coming, want to make muffins quick and easy 1. Quality to start your day 
2. start your day 
3. Could say something about nourishment or taste, quality you can taste, enjoyable way to start the day 
4. home, a breakfast that is special// break up routine, morning time, alone or expecting company coming, want to make muffins quick and easy, maybe make to take to a breakfast Less words 
Not all the concepts in one add 
avoid repetition 
use more imagery than words 
add humor potentially 
indicate price/ ingredients/ allergies 
source of product 
don't like "" show you care"" with muffin mixes 
don't like ""introducing"" people know if it's an add that you are introducing a product 
don't like saying gluten or dairy brings you down, if you want to target a wider audience don't demonize certain ingredients. people buy products that don't have gluten or dairy and also consume others that do 
bake now and freeze later seems s trange, people want fresh muffins if they are so easy to make why are we freezing them and then eating them 
claim back your mornings is strange to me, nothing about muffins makes me feel like i am claiming back my mornings 
portable breakfast and breakfasts on the go are the same thing 
not everyone has a family so saying things like everyone instead of family will encourage people who don't have families to buy them 
you could include the amount per serving/ amount of servings and get the same point across. People know chips are enjoyed by many people, if you want to say family size or something that makes you think more about size instead of who is consuming it 

don't have any adds to share, I try to avoid adds on social media 3- plant forward favorites 
1. plant 
2.  I don't love the word plant- forward, I think there is better way to say it like plant based or ingredients from nature- wholesome plant ingredients idk  
3. people love bars maybe a bar or those terrible almond butter squeeze tubes, personally i'd like to see some ice cream or bread 2- Better for you better for growers 
1/2 source of product- better for growers, better for you, this phrasing isn't perfect but it's getting there I think tying the product to the source and how that source is important to you is very relevant- why is it better for you? because it's almond based or because it is also better for the growers so you are participating in an ethical & sustainable sourcing of ingredients 
3. like mentioned before, ice cream, bars, weird packets, people love the combination of a fruit or vegetable and dip, maybe something there- trail mix, cookies - what do the growers like? maybe they have good insight here 1/2- from orchard to table 
orchard is a great word not used in branding, farm to table gets overdone and bougie and assumed expensive, i like to table because I think people should sit and eat a table. should be cautious with the table if you are simultaneously advertising this to be eaten on the go, there is cognitive dissonance in consuming that media. I like reference to the source, maybe add a picture of an orchard and farmers eating whatever the product is or the muffins falling from trees or something. fun surrealist 
3. like mentioned before, ice cream, bars, weird packets of almond butter i don't like but other do people love the combination of a fruit or vegetable and dip, maybe something there- trail mix, cookies ? crackers . people seem to be into almond cheese, that seems very processed. Almond based pie crusts, almond pancakes almond crepes Didn't get an images to go with the language so it's difficult to get language that feels correct without knowing what icons or imagery will accompany the advertisement",Hollywood,ENFP
334696,Rachel,Yonts,rachelyontski@gmail.com,"1. This ad would call my attention because I like to try our non-traditional desserts, which help me to be more healthy and my family. In addition, we really like desserts made from almond flour, they are very tasty. And the idea of having an easy and fast dessert is very striking because sometimes you are at home and you have not prepared any dessert and at some point in the afternoon you need a snack but you do not want to cook, so this product would be a solution for this moment.

2. Well, I hope to meet all 20 words.
The slogan I think would say something like this: Do you need a very tasty and healthy dessert? And besides, do you need to make this sweet in just a couple of seconds? Well, here is the solution! fast and healthy! without compromising the taste! 1. craving convenience.

2. I really liked this: cake made with almond flour
sourced directly from our cooperative of
family-owned California growers.
Because I feel that by buying this product I support local producers in my country. And I think that we can make quality products at a good price and produce, for example, tasty desserts.


3. I think the concept is very good. Perhaps it should be added to the packages that can be recycled or reused for other things. Because it could mean a lot of garbage for the environment if I eat one of these desserts daily or every couple of days.

4. I would like to enjoy it when I don't have time and I don't feel like making a baked dessert. Or when I am working and I have many hours of continuous work and I want to eat something sweet and delicious quickly without wasting time.


- Where are you? in my home office
- how does it feel? with many desires to eat sweet without guilt in order to continue working with more encouragement.
- what time is it? mid-afternoon.
- Who are you with? With my family. All in their activities from home.
- why do you feel like a Tasty Little Cup? Because I forgot to prepare a dessert and I don't have time to bake anything. But I really want to eat something sweet. So I look for it and in a couple of seconds later I'm eating something healthy and sweet. 1. Great Taste Without the Waste

2.  This: Tasty Little Cups from Blue
Diamond. Made with the highest quality
ingredients that deliver a rich taste experience
combined with natural nourishment.
Because I know the brand and I know they make quality products

3. I don't see anything to improve. Everything is fine

4. I imagine myself in the same situation that I said in the previous question. 1. Quality you can trust

2.  This: Enjoy the decadent taste of freshly
baked cake in a cup made with the highest
quality gluten- and dairy-free ingredients.

because the brand is good and uses almond flour in a good healthy option and very delicious at the same time. We also already know that they use top quality products

3. As I said before, I don't see anything to improve. Only maybe you could go for a greener option.

4. same situation Yes, perhaps the part of not polluting the environment may be that you are forgetting a little.
It could help that the dessert packaging is biodegradable or recycled or can be used for something else.

I chose this ad because the packaging they use is free of plastic, which is one of the strongest major pollutants in the environment. I understand that you cannot use any material in the microwave to cook, but it may be an idea to improve the environment looking for a greener packaging 1.  almond is what catches my eye. Because it is a good substitute for wheat and gluten

2.  Do you want a delicious guilt-free dessert made with the best ingredients and quick to make? 1. Fass free favorites

2. because I can make the dessert that I like whenever I want easily and quickly

3. I could not open the file

4.  The situation would be the same as always. Because with the pandemic there are not many possibilities to imagine other moments. 1. Quality You Can Trust

2.  Because I know the brand and I know that they always make good quality products for people.

3.  i couldn't open file

4.  Well, trying to imagine another situation. It could be, in the middle of the afternoon, in our living room. With the whole family together, watching television. Kids crave a snack dessert. I forgot to bake something and I remember that I have these cups in my pantry. I go running to look for them, and with a couple of seconds I already have the individual dessert for each member of the family. Faster than some popcorn. 1. Tasty Treats to Share

2.  because it is a very quick solution for any member of the family and very healthy

3. I could not open the file

4. Another idea, could be that my children come home (before covid19) with a couple of friends and want to eat something sweet as a snack while studying. And I haven't had time to bake anything, so I use these rates to solve my problem quickly and everyone is very happy. Sorry, but I don't see anything wrong with this concept. They are all very well made.
The only thing I could add is the recycling concept. And I have already explained it in the previous activity. 1. The first thing that comes to mind is that I am going to enjoy a muffin with a really almond flavor because I know that it is of good quality and sufficient quantity of almonds

2.  If you need good quality almonds in your life and in your daily snack, this product is the solution for you, your expectations are fulfilled with this product. 1. A Family Breakfast 

2.  Bring joy to your family brunch with delicious,
freshly baked muffins that everyone will love. 

because bringing joy to my family is priceless

3.  Nothing to improve. It is very good

4.  I am at a breakfast with my family and I already have the muffins ready because I could prepare and refrigerate them in advance and I can offer them a quick and healthy breakfast 1. Bake Now, Enjoy Later

2. Muffin mixes you can bake now and freeze
for later

because it saves me time during rush hour

3. Nothing. Looks very good

4. I think I am in a similar situation to the previous one. We are all in a hurry in the morning to go to our jobs and schools, but I had already gone ahead and had healthy muffins prepared 1. Bake Together With Love

2. Share your love of home baked muffins that the
whole family can enjoy. 

because the best way to show love with food

3. Nothing... it is beautiful

4. Here I think I can imagine making muffins on a Sunday with my children helping to prepare our breakfasts for the week. All together sharing with family I say again that the part of being sustainable with the environment is missing. And I really liked the ad that I have already placed previously. And I put them back on Plant-forward Favorites

1. Deliciously nutritious plant-forward food.

because nutrition is a very important factor

2. Nothing, looks very good

3. Cookies Faster Fixes

1. Products with the ease of ready-to-eat foods but
the satisfaction and flavour of home cooking. 

because this is the best combination to achieve the balance that every mother wants to achieve

2. Nothing. I like it all

3.  Bread Powered by the Almond 

1. Eat better with almonds, the superfood that
adds a nutritious boost to the food you eat. 

because almonds are a great source of energy and healthy nutrients

3.  I would like you to name a little more the nutritional value of eating almonds or the advantages

3. bread, cookies As I have always said, they forget about the sustainable part. And I would like you to highlight a little more the advantages of eating almonds",Hollywood,
225811,Renee,Townsend,rtown50@sbcglobal.net,"1.  I would take notice if the image if the product looked appealing. 
2.  Do you want to try something that tastes like nothing you've ever tasted before?  You'll be glad you did. I chose craving convenience because it's after a long day and I want something fresh but quick and easy.  I think I would omit ""fleeting"" because it makes me feel like if I just wait a short time my craving will be over and I won't need a treat.  I would include the ""natural"" concept.  Again, my favorite place would be on the couch after dinner when I am watching t.v.  I want to relax with a tlc as a tasty treat. I chose craving convenience because it's after a long day and I want something fresh but quick and easy.  I think I would omit ""fleeting"" because it makes me feel like if I just wait a short time my craving will be over and I won't need a treat.  I would include the ""natural"" concept.  Again, my favorite place would be on the couch after dinner when I am watching t.v.  I want to relax with a tlc as a tasty treat. I chose quality you can trust.  I found many words that stood out such as lovingly made, finest California almond flour, natural ingredients, the almond people and scrumptious.   I might condense the almond flour description and state ... family owned California growers, Blue Diamond, the Almond people altogether.  I wouldn't repeat California-grown in the third paragraph.   I might have the in the afternoon at work as a snack.  I feel I need a little pick me up and a tlc feels like the perfect treat at the perfect size. They key concepts would be mentioning the quality natural ingredients made from california blue diamond almonds, the quick easy prep and cleanup, and satisfying treat.
I chose this Charmin ad because I found the thank you an impressive angle.  They appreciate their customers. Stating that we are all one community is inclusive and makes me feel like we are in this together. 1.  An image of a delicious looking dessert.
2.  A new way of baking.  A healthy alternative is almond flour, a natural, dairy free, gluten free product.  Try it today. I chose Plant Forward Favorites which is interesting because I chose the same as my 3rd choice for tlc.  I like the same sentence in both - ""nourishment that lifts you up with gluten or dairy to bring you down.  I like the words ""quality ingredients"".  Again, I think I would just mention the gluten and dairy free information just one time, not two.  I would replace the 2nd mention with more information about natural nourishment.  

I am at home with my family and have eaten dinner and are ready for dessert.  I feel happy to be sharing a treat with my family and happy that we are going to enjoy something that everyone likes.  I feel like a Blue Diamond baking mix because it is a fresh, delicious dessert with health benefits. I chose Fuss Free Favorites.  I liked the concept of being simple.  I think enjoying a homemade baked item that is easy to put together is a plus in this busy world.  I like the phrase ""maximum enjoyment"".  I think I would add the fact that the almonds are natural and California grown.  

It's a Saturday afternoon where I have a little extra time to prepare a treat and since it isn't complicated, I can put it together easily and quickly.  I feel good that I am preparing something for my family to enjoy.  After I take it out of the oven, I am going to treat myself to a sample before anyone else.  I will sit back and relax and share it with my family later.  I feel like a Blue Diamond Baking Mix because it's quick, easy, somewhat healthy and tasty. I chose Quality You Can Trust which, again, is the concept I chose for tlc also.  I like the  phrases of wholesome goodness, finest California grown almond flour, and natural ingredients.
I really like the phrase ""Quality home baking with a healthy twist"".  It's the perfect combination - quality, home baking and healthy too.  I might change the heading to sound a little more catchy.  Maybe, Have your cake and eat it too.  Tasty and healthy.

I think I would serve this for company.  It would be something that I prepared with quality ingredients and not store bought.  So it would something that I would be proud to serve.  I would use Blue Diamond Baking mix because it would be easy to put together without a lot of fuss.  I'd whip up a few appetizers or dips, have some drinks and serve a Blue Diamond cake. I would use visuals of quality products that are used in the mix such as fresh almonds on the side, cocoa beans, quality chocolate etc.

The quality, healthy, natural gluten free, dairy free ingredients made easy and ready to share with family and friends sums it up. 1.  An image of fresh, natural ingredients like almonds and depending on the flavor, maybe, fresh blueberries, or raisins, etc.  A freshly baked item maybe cut in half to intensify the senses.

2. Nothing tastes better than the fresh goodness of Blue Diamond muffins.   Natural, fresh, wholesome goodness at your fingertips.  Bake them today. 1.  Bake Now, Enjoy Later is my third choice. 

2. The phrase ""claim back your mornings"" definitely caught my attention.  At least for me, mornings are usually a hectic time.  Having something  that is healthy, tasty and ready to go would be great.

3.  I think I would just include more about the healthy nutritious aspect such as made with high quality almonds.

4.  I would be getting ready to leave the house for work in the morning and I would feel rushed and anxious thinking about the drive and day ahead of me.  Grabbing a Blue Diamond Muffin would be the perfect item to take with me because it's nutritious, ready to eat and portable. 1.  2nd Place is A Quality Start Your Day.

2.  The words and phrases that caught my attention are ""superfood, start your day right, and low carbs, high protein fibre and good fats"".  

3.  The concept title needs to say - A Quality Start to your Day to sound more complete.

4.  It would be breakfast on a weekend.  I would be getting up and wanting to start my day right with eating something nutritious and good for me.  No guilt, I would be relaxed and slowly sip my coffee with my muffin.  I feel like a blue Diamond muffin because it's good, nutritious and since I made them last night, they are ready to eat. 1.  Muffins Made Easy.

2,  The title really caught my attention.  It's catchy and appealing because homemade and easy is a perfect combination.

3.  I might omit the second time ""made easy"" is used and just end the concept with it so not to be redundant.

4.  I am alone in the evening and have a taste for a treat.  A Blue Diamond Muffin sounds delicious.  It's, easy and quick and I can enjoy a warm homebaked treat in a jiffy. I think if the concept includes the health benefits, the delicious taste and the fuss free, easy preparation that everyone can enjoy that would be great. 1.  I liked from Orchard to Table because it connected the natural homegrown concept with the finished product.  I liked the idea that it is grown with love by family growers.  I i also liked the ""new"" range of almond flour.  ""New""  makes it more enticing.
2.  I don't know if I would say ""goodness we all know and love"" while it's true for most but for some people this might be their 1st time trying Blue Diamond and that's  ok.  Maybe just say enjoy the farm fresh goodness that you will love.
3.  I think pasta might be a good fit. 1.  I liked Plant Forward Favorites because it emphasized high quality almonds and lifts you up without gluten and dairy to bring you down.  
2.  I think favorites should be spelled the same in the title and content.  Also, it should mention that it is fast and fuss free.
3.  I think other products could be cookies, bread, buns, rolls, donuts and pastry dough. 1.  I chose Powered by the Almond.  I like this title.  It is empowering, strong and confident.  I liked "" eat better, natural goodness, and the Almond people "".
2.  Again. I think i would mention the fact that it is fuss free and easy.
3.  I'd like to try making tortillas and pizza dough. 1.  Putting attention on almond flour being ""better"" for you.  
2.  I think the fact that it is new should be emphasized in all concepts.  It entices people to want to try it.",Hollywood,
300180,Daria,Wilcocks,dariawilcocks@gmail.com,"1. A video of the cake rising in a mug and the 'ping' of the microwave, before revealing the inside with a slo-mo of the spoon dipping into the cake - basically it would need to feel like an immediate sensorial experience for me to stop scrolling. There could even be elements of the flavours involved in an animation surrounding the mug, like pieces of chocolate, almonds etc

4. 
- At home, at work
- In the mood for something quick and tasty without a sugar crash, in need of a pick-me-up, craving something sweet after healthy food
- Probably closer to afternoon/ early evening
- On my own
- I have a sweet tooth but try to eat healthily most of the day, I'm suffering with PMS, I've had a busy morning and need a little treat to keep going 1. I think the most important thing is to try and have some sort of moving elements within the ad to grab attention, whether it's steam rising from the cup, some words popping up, or the cup spinning round etc. It would make me stop and look at it rather than a static one. I also think the mug needs to be the hero of the ad, you need to understand straight away that this quick, tasty treat is consumed from a mug/cup.

2. I think the gluten-free message is lost quite a lot, but not sure if this needs to be translated through a small icon rather than being the topline message.

3. https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/536772849338588234/

This isn't an ad as such as I haven't seen an ad specifically that I feel is relevant for this category and would be useful. However, I think Pinterest is a good platform to scroll through when you search 'cake in a mug' as there's lots of video tutorials that show people how to make them. Bearing this principle in mind, I think some elements of these types of videos could be utilised; top down/birds eye shot, spoon going into cake to show lovely texture and give you an idea of flavour, stop-frame animation of the product being enjoyed. All these factors can quickly translate the messaging, then once made with a higher production value I think it could be really eye-catching! 1. I think the key thing here would be to incorporate some sort of plant motif/design that is mixed in with the typical cake/baking design, to really drill home to the viewer that this is a plant-based product. There could be a sort of kaleidoscopic effect of all the different ingredients such as almonds from the flour swirling into a bowl and the end result is the baked product, looking perfect!

2.
- Baking the goodness into your favourite home recipes
- The power of plants to supercharge your at-home baking favourites 1. Tasty Treats To Share

2. 'Share the love' and 'bring joy' made me take notice, as baking is seen traditionally as something that you can enjoy as a family or with the end goal of sharing. You rarely bake a special something to only eat it on your own, so I think this is a nice sentiment.

3. Show you care with baking mixes made to share.

4. 

- At home
- In a generous, loving and caring mood
- It's early afternoon (approx 1-3pm)
- I'm with my family or have friends coming round in the late afternoon
- I want something quick and wholesome to share with my friends/family that they will be impressed with, but hasn't been too stressful for me to prepare 1. Plant Forward Favourites

2. 'alternatives to classic favourites' 'delicious nourishment' is a positive way of calling out the benefits of the product here, but I think saying gluten or dairy will get you down is a bit harsh and might put someone off who is more flexible in their diet choices. They don't want to be shamed for eating those things at other times, so keeping it more general appeals to a wider audience.

- At home
- In the mood to entertain but have specific dietary requirements or want something more nutritious than the usual treat food
- It's early afternoon or evening, probably a weekend
- I'm preparing a treat for the family or waiting to see friends (maybe taking the final product around to a friends house)
- I'm curious to try something new, want to enjoy myself guilt-free, don't want to have a blood sugar crash later on 1. Bake Together With Love

2. 'Share your love' and 'create shared memories' struck out to me the most because it makes you feel like the brand understands your desires to be passionate about baking and food, without compromising on flavour. 

3. Fun and easy baking mixes for the whole family.

4. 
- At home
- In an energetic, fun and loving mood
- It's late morning or early afternoon on a weekend
- I'm with my family
- I want to do something wholesome and fun with the family that doesn't involve loads of complicated steps and means everyone can get involved. I want to treat the family without worrying about an unhealthy diet, but I also want to show them that classic baking favourites can be enjoyed without the need for dairy or gluten ingredients. 1. I get the impression that the ad for this concept needs to feel quite well rounded in terms of its audience, it's not as specific as perhaps the cake in a mug product is. It needs to appeal to more of a family audience in my eyes, so the direction of the ad needs to reflect this. I definitely think whatever concept you go with, that the plant-based aspect to the mixes needs to be clear whether through visuals or through the script if there's audio.

2. Again, I think it's really important to drive home the message that just because these are plant-based, gluten-free and dairy-free, that they do not compromise on flavour and I think this message is a little lost in the concepts so far.

3. https://www.instagram.com/p/B_151uxjlOZ/

I think Nakd bars in general produce good, clear visuals about their products which makes you think how exciting the flavour combinations must be, whilst also communicating the gluten-free, dairy-free messaging. The simple 'Mind Blown' tagline at the bottom makes you think how easily your mindset could be changed at how tasty this sort of product is (for instance if you felt like vegan food is mostly tasteless, this type of advert could potentially change your mind and encourage you to try it) 1. Think this ad needs to be clearly communicating the ease of two parts (wet + dry) coming together and voila! a muffin appears - I'd keep the background really simple, maybe even the Blue Diamond blue colour and then the product appearing at the end with some nicely designed text around it to end.

2. 
- Delicious home-baked Muffins in minutes

2.  'muffins made easy

- At home or at work during a tea break
- In the mood for a sweet treat that's not too heavy
- It's around 11am when I want my second cup of tea or coffee, or late afternoon as a snack at home
- I'm on my own or with family
- I have been trying to cut down on higher sugar treats and want to switch to a healthier alternative to a favourite baked good that I enjoy! 1. Bake Together With Love

2. 'Fun for the whole family' stood out to me as muffins is something that everyone can enjoy easily because they can have their own portion, so if there's an easy way of making it together then that is also an added bonus and a reason to purchase

3. Nutritious home-baked muffin mixes for
the whole family to enjoy, ready in two easy steps.

- At home
- In the mood to treat the family and want to give them something that I know will sustain their energy for a long time
- It's late morning on a weekend or early evening during the week
- I'm with the family
- I want to show my family that tasty treats don't need to be unhealthy and can also be made fuss-free with quality ingredients. 1. Plant Forward Mornings

2. I think this is quite a unique concept and one that would stand out from competitors for me. I liked the 'delicious nourishment' coupled with 'highest quality ingredients' because it ties in the idea that a traditionally unhealthy snack can actually be made with better ingredients for you. The bit that doesn't resonate with me as much is 'start your day right' as it's not a traditional breakfast food in the UK, but I will leave it in the concept below if that is the ocassion that you are wanting to go with.

3.

4. 
- At home
- Healthy and like I want to continue my good efforts but in the mood for a little treat to keep me going.
- Morning 
- I'm on my own or with my partner
- I am in the mood for a little treat, but don't want the hassle of going out and buying something specially. I want something that I can make quickly and easily from going into my own cupboard, with potential leftovers that I can use throughout the week. 1. I think the ad can be really short in total (5 seconds max) and focus on the ease of making the product, so you clearly see the dry and wet ingredients combining together somehow to create a tray of delicious muffins. Again, the ingredients need to be brought in visually in a clear and exciting way, perhaps as graphics or flourishing details around the product before the ad ends.

2. I think that the concept needs to feel quite different to other easy at-home baking mixes for it to stand-out on shelf, which is why I went for the Plant-forward Mornings as my favourite - it's not something you usually see in the home baking section of the supermarket. I'd also like to know how much protein these kind of products can provide if they're specifically aimed at a breakfast time to enjoy. How will a potentially lighter product keep me feeling fuller for longer? Can the almond protein content be plugged anywhere?

3. https://www.instagram.com/p/CCOVtDQJiXM/ This is a different category, but I like the simple execution of this content. It blends pictures and words seamlessly and the small details like the squeezing animation really helps communicate their message clearly and in a short space of time. I also like how the ad ends with the final product presented in a really enticing way. 1. Powered by the Almond : ' the superfood that
adds a nutritious boost' definitely caught my attention as it moves the messaging away from purely gluten-free to something that is a bit more intriguing to a wider audience.

2. We are the Almond People. We make real food powered by the natural goodness of
our California-grown almonds.
Our almonds help you eat better, they are the superfood that
adds a nutritious boost to the food we all know and love.
Introducing a new range of almond flour foods
from Blue Diamond. 

3. Wraps, tortilla chips, breakfast bars Better For You, Better For Growers: Well the fact that the word cooperative is repeated three times obviously really drives home the message of it being a socially responsible brand, although I think it's a bit unnecessary to say it this many times! I also liked 'support a network of family-owned growers' because it makes you believe that you are putting your money to good use when you buy the brand.

2. Quality foods brought to you with love from our
cooperative of California almond growers. With your help, we're supporting them to make great food!
Introducing a new range of almond flour foods
from Blue Diamond. Made with the finest
almonds, you can enjoy the highest quality
natural foods and support a network of family-owned growers.

3. Tortilla chips, interesting/artisanal breads, pastries 1. From Orchard to Table: 'natural, sun-soaked goodness' really sums it up for me, it invokes good feelings and makes you think you're buying into a brand that is nourishing you from the inside out. I think it's also good that you've got the 'family-owned California orchards'  within this same concept as it does the same job as the 'Better For You, Better for Growers' but doesn't need spelling out, it's implied within those few words that Blue Diamond is doing a good thing for its employees/growers.

2. Delicious foods made with natural, whole-food
ingredients. Enjoy the natural, sun-soaked goodness of
almonds grown exclusively in orchards with love by Californian family growers.
Introducing a new range of almond flour foods
from Blue Diamond. Enjoy the nutritious, farm fresh goodness we all know and love.

3. Cereals/granola, pastries, tortilla chips I think the visuals are going to be super important here. On the website you see a lot about new products in their packaging, you get a few real-life images of recipe ideas but I'd like to see more lifestyle/editorial style images of the actual finished products such as the Tasty Little Cups and what they actually look like. It will help convince me as someone that doesn't need to be gluten-free that it is an enticing product, just as much as it will reassure gluten-free people that the product doesn't compromise on quality or flavour just because it is gluten-free. It may also help to think of some clever partnerships with influencers who can tell the brand story in a compelling way - invite some of them to see the growers in action for instance? Get people to cook or bake with the products and put their on twist on it? 

2. I was struck by the use of 'Almond People' within one of the concepts that didn't seem to appear anywhere else. This in itself I think is a really strong concept, to be known as 'the Almond People' so if it hasn't been made into an overarching concept before, maybe now is the time to help tie all of these products together?",Hollywood,
334672,Tammy ,Butterworth ,tammy.butterworthusa@icloud.com,"1. Some description of the experience- warm and fluffy, like cozy clouds. Something about the flavor would be interesting too. And to get me to take notice on IG of course a great lifestyle image. 
2. Blue Diamond’s Tasty Little Cups are perfect for when you need a moment of TLC. 1. I put naughty but nicer in third place. 
2. I liked the balance of indulgent and nourishing. Rich taste was a nice way to describe it, and natural nourishment- this makes me want to add it to my repertoire. 
3. I am not sure if it is too much info- but adding in how quick/convenient it is- this is what’s missing for me to have it in third place. Or maybe an indulgent nourishment. 
4. I am at home as I need a microwave (I may have one as a spare in the office for a tough afternoon escape)- I feel tired and in need of a boost/lift of spirits. I am likely with my family, settling down in the evening before bed. (My kids like mug cakes- due to the instant gratification- they can ‘make’ them, and they are ready in a minute- perfect in a child’s world). I feel like a tasty cup as it is quick, warm, cozy, tasty, and not that bad for me. 1. Indulgent Me Time
2. I liked ‘feel good indulgence’- I enjoy moments of indulgence, but they can make me feel guilty afterwards- this would be that moment, and feeling good after. win win. 
3. I am not sure it has to be entirely ‘me time’- it’s nice to have shared indulgence too, to think I am eating mug cakes on my own all of the time maybe feels glutinous, but sharing and having with my family, that’s nice to imagine. 
4. As it is written, after the kids go to bed, when I am winding down and thinking about my day. I am on the sofa. I feel good and like I should be rewarded. It’s just me. I feel like I earned it with a day well done. 1. Craving convenience
2. I do crave things, convenience is key as I work and have two kids, a husband and other interests to fill my time. I like to make mug cakes with the boys- they love to bake but sometimes when the desire lifts their hearts, the timing is not right, or we don’t have the ingredients to bake etc- this is the natural thing for me to offer as a convenient alternative. I liked the ‘big taste’ piece too, when health and convenience solids, taste often loses out- seems like not here. Yum!
3. No improvements to suggest. 
4. I am at home on the weekend- mid afternoon, with the family and we want to have some fun. We feel cheeky and like we should break some rules. Mid afternoon, with the boys. We want to feel happy together. 2. I really think an aspect of shared experiences with kids could be good- as parents we want them to have treats, and bonding experiences- we know they often aren’t healthy. If these bring health balance- then its perfect to bring joy AND peace of mind. 
3. I had to look around for this- I couldn’t think of one instantly...
I chose ‘me undies’- I think this ad they put on facebook is good at showing all of those moments of connection and joy- and how you should forget about the basics and just enjoy. 1. A sense of what this solves for me- is it making free-from easier and predictable, is it making tasty healthier? 
I want to see a cake and some sense of the benefit to me of having this as the cake I choose to make. 
2. Free From baking at its best- it’s free from gluten and dairy, and its also free from hassle- you don’t need that in your life! 1. Bake together with love
2. I like the idea of creating shared moments- we do a lot of baking together in this family, so this resonates.
3. I think it overpromises on teaching healthy food habits, I’d soften that or change it for something else. MAybe I feel like we can do it more due to the health benefits. To the little ones its cake, they aren’t at an age where they are impressed that its almond flour. (Though they would be happy that Daddy can eat what they made as he is gluten free and often misses out- so maybe its shared moments for the whole family- despite dietary restrictions?)
4. At home isn’t he kitchen at the weekend, Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning- a moment to reconnect after a busy week for everyone. 1. Fuss free favorites
2. I like it is simple, maximum enjoyment and delicious- sounds very accessible, and very needed for our house. We like fuss free fun. 
3. No suggestions to improve. 
4. I might be able to squeeze this one in after school/during the week as it is simple and fuss free- rather than waiting for the weekend. I imagine it would be something the boys could take the lead on and feel like they have created something we can then all enjoy. 1. Tasty Treats to Share
2. Who doesn’t like sharing their baking and getting complements? OFten when we bake there is too much cake- so sharing is a lovely way to balance the experience, some enjoyment, but limiting waste/overindulgence. I like that it brings joy, and its favorites everyone will love. Sounds amazing. 
3. Call out gluten free means more peop0le can join the fun? 
4. I would make it mid-week to take into the office through the week (when we are of course working in a real and actual office), I would make for family parties. I would do this one more on my own vs the others being with kids, I’d want it to be perfect so I can show it off- so this one is solo baking, not family baking. 1. NA
2. I think for the sharing one- maybe cupcakes would be an option too- I was picturing a full cake for the others, but cupcakes are good for sharing, especially if I want some to be for at home, and some to be for at work. The other thing I wonder about too is frosting...can this be included? 
3. I don’t have any. 1. I would want to know it is tasty, easy and healthy. I would be interested in the flavors/varieties too- and a nice picture. 
2. Muffins made from almonds....get out...no really- you aren’t dreaming! You can have your cake and eat it after all. 1. Family BReakfast
2. I like the notion of care and joy, nutritious and natural- things that bring us together, that bring a shared a joy meant are always good. 
3. I might change joy to something around connection- joy might be a bit strong, I don’t know what it is that brings the joy? Include gluten free, so all of the family can enjoy no matter their dietary needs? 
4. At home, weekend- feel like I have time and we can have an indulgent breakfast time together. It will be around 9am, with my husband and two boys. We like to make nice breakfasts that we can all enjoy. 1. Bake now enjoy later
2. Genius- I do want to reclaim my morning, the grab and go is a great idea. 
3. Not sure about freezing- that makes me feel like I can’t actually grab and go as I don’t want to have a frozen muffin...
4. I am going to work- driving my car, I eat many things whilst driving- and they often are not that healthy, so this would be great. I am alone, its around 8am- and I want taste and convenience . 1. Quality start to your day
2. I do want to kick start and be set up for the day ahead, I want superfood, protein, fibre and good fat- amazing- when can I get it!!! 
3. I don’t need the California call out- this is nutrition and getting me to a good place. You could get the almonds from anywhere. 
4. I am at home/heading out, we are all busy and doing our thing to get ready (husband and two sons)- this is mobile, convenient, nutritious and needs no thought. It’s around 7.30 and this is something to make sure we have prepared for the day ahead. 1. I love these ideas- I think the grab and go, combined with setting me up for the day ahead- that would be something special. 
2. No. 
3. sorry- I just don’t have any good examples here. 1. Orchard to table goodness- I liked the goodness aspect, and how it was born of love, and from one family to another. 
2. Is there something about heritage, generations of families growing with love? 
3. Favorite flavors/recipes from the growers themselves. 1. Faster fixes- I liked the calling out of ‘ease of ready to eat’ and ‘satisfaction and flavor of cooking at home’ 
2. I think the nutrition is important too- often with convenience it either doesn’t taste good isn’t healthy, or both. 
3. Toaster pockets, frozen line. 1. Powered by the almond- liked natural goodness, eat better, superfood, nutritional boost. 
2. No suggestions
3. Almond boosts for cooking other meals 1. I love the ideas, will definitely try. I think a big emphasis on goodness and family is good. 
2. I wonder if within the ranges there can be some items made specifically to appeal to the children? Mine love to bake, so would want them to try this- but they won’t be attracted to it if it feels too ‘grown up’- and some of the blue diamond products seem to feel a little older.",Hollywood,
334674,Paula,Villaseñor,paulavibe@gmail.com,"I am personally not inclined towards pre-baked goods, so I would need to see a very clear health and flavor articulation. The texture in the cake, a beautiful mug, some almonds and healthy ingredients in the image composition to make it distinctive, I would forego branding at the beginning, or do some subtle form like the example from Kefir below. I know convenience can be a big driver for some people but those who are really interested in their health will be skeptical of something advertised for the microwave. I think we need to find balance between the 2 to make sure it engages with a broad audience and not only those interested in quick and convenient.

Tagline sugestion:
""All the luscious sponginess of a mugcake without any ""baddies""- our new ""brandname"" made with high quality almond flour and (other ingredients)- no gluten, no lactose, no guilt, 60 seconds and you are set for enjoyment! 1.Naughty but Nicer
2. I love that it articulates the positive traits of California Almonds. It focuses on positive health benefits and integrates the experience of tasting and eating the cake : An indulgent treat packed with the nourishing goodness of California almonds. Highest quality ingredients, rich taste, natural nourishment.

3.I would change the opening line: indulgent cake in a cup in just 60 seconds- WHERE ARE THE ALMONDS AND THE JOY THEY GIVE US :)- I would focus more on the almonds than on the 60 second benefit.

4. I would probably eat them as a dessert of mid afternoon snack, when I need a sugar boost. I would pair it with coffee. I would probably feel good about eating something that is delicious but also healthy, like when you eat dark chocolate and nuts. It would be quite convenient to have it ready in 60 seconds so I can continue with my work day. 1.Plant forward goodness.
2. I like how it integrates the almond benefit from the start: Plant-forward cake, it also mentions it is gluten and lactose free which is a much seeked for benefit in baked goods.: made with the highest quality gluten- and dairy-free ingredients.
3. I would move away from the ""negative"" attributes of gluten and dairy and focus on the energy and joy we get from almonds.without the gluten or dairy to bring you down! - I would be more intentional about ALMONDS vs PLANT
4. My answer does not really change from the last part, i dont think the concept would make me consume the product in a different setting or situation. 1.Quality you can trust
2. I love that it talks very clearly about Almonds and where they are sourced. almond flour sourced directly from our cooperative of family-owned California growers. 
3. I think it could talk about the healthy side of almonds, maybe mix with concept : packed with the nourishing goodness of California almonds. 1. I would stay close to communicating the benefits and positive attributes of almonds and how they are sourced.
2. From the packaging ideas I feel they look more like ice-cream than something on the healthier side of the aisle, there are certain ""healthy"" cues both visual and in terms of words and font. I would make sure to have at least 1 version designed for this purpose. For me any instagram ad needs to be visually compelling and very coherent. In this case I would expect to see either a finalized baked good that looks delicious (and of course is topped with sliced almonds) in a very beautifully set table- OR some baking process, maybe mixing the dough and some of the ingredients laid around the mix to illustrate what is in the product. Branding needs to be present but not front and center, it needs to make me feel hungry but also entice me to bake.

Tagline would be something like: ""baking+almonds=joy 1. Quality you can trust
2.I like how this idea builds on classic baking goodness, and the people who grow the almonds. It also connects with wholesomeness and healthy benefits of the product.  wholesome 
 goodness of almond flour, Classic baking, Quality home baking with a healthy twist!
3. It doesn´t mention the turnaround, or final product that will come from this, it does not evoke the actual baked good or the experience of tasting it.
4. For me these products are either to enjoy at home, or bring as gifts when you visit friends. I would not eat this alone, but enjoy the process of baking with my daughter and eating this together. 1.Bake Together with Love
2. I love the idea of baking as a family and making it part of our everyday life, enjoyment as a family. Share your love of baking classic favorite treats
that the whole family can enjoy. 
3. It does not convey the ingredient or final product experience 
4, i dont think my consumption of the product would be affected by the communication. 1.Plant Forward Favorites
2. I like how it focuses on the ingredients and the health benefit. Delicious nourishment that lifts you up Plant-forward alternatives to classic baked
favorites. 
3. I am not sure about Plant-forward as a concept, I am not sure if it is broadly used and can create a bit of confusion it it isn´t. 
4. I would enjoy ti at home with my daughter and feel happy about having healthy alternatives for my family and myself. I am very keen to use almond products and like integrating them in our diet. I believe the sweet spot is the middle between final product, ingredient and experience. Some of the concepts focus more on one or the other, but have not seen one that can effectively deliver those 3. I think every muffin´s dream is to become a cupcake--- approach them as a fun, versatile and tasty. 1.Plant forward mornings
2. Start your day right, Delicious nourishment that lifts you up - I like the empowering tone and how a muffin can improve your day so much :) and it focuses on the experience and benefit as well: Enjoy the delicious taste of freshly baked muffins 
3. I would evaluate the Plant-forward wording, its confusing for me.

4. Muffins are super versatile and you can enjoy them along the day since they travel so well, Unlike other baked goods they are more resistent and practical, I see myself having them for breakfast or packing them for lunch for me and my family. 1. A Family Breakfast
2. I like the idea of muffins bringing joy to a family and making everyone feel happy and together. I am a super fan of family breakfast on sundays so this idea is very appealing to me. Bring joy to your family brunch with delicious, freshly baked muffins that everyone will love. - the concept stays true to the essence of muffins and does not forget the ingredient: made with the highest quality almond
flour and nutritious natural ingredients

3. Instead of making it a way to show you care, it can be a moment to share as a family, for example baking together.

4. At home, with my family, for breakfast. 1.A Quality Start your day
2. I like the idea of starting the day strong and energized, I like integrating almonds and baked goods that are delicious but also a good source of energy (vs something more decadent but super sugary) give you everything you need to kick start your day.  I like how it talks about the nutrition benefits: Its ilow in carbs and high protein, fibre, and good fats as away to set you up for the day ahead.
3. they dont seem delicious, just super healthy.

4. on the go, to work :) Approach muffins with a fun mind, they are so versatile, easy to make, tasty and easy to transport that you can showcase them in many situations, in a beautifully set table, or on the go, fun fun fun 1.Better for you Better for our growers. - Enjoy the highest quality natural foods and support a network of family owned growers. I like knowing where my food comes from and if I can support families through my purchase I tend to lean towards those projects. 
2. I dont think it focuses enough on the actual almonds.
3. I think the proposed range is quite appealing, maybe you can go into almond oils and beauty products,, 1. From Orchard to Table. Delicious foods made with natural, whole food ingredients. Enjoy the natural, sun-soaked goodness of almonds grown with love by family growers- I like this idea because it centers a bit more on the almonds but does not move away completely from the source and growers. The sun soaked idea really comes forward and illustrates a beautiful picture of where they come from:
2. If you think about broadening the range beyond  food items, for example almond oils, creams or beauty products, you might want to eliminate the Table, and make it From our orchard to your home.
3. maybe an almond based granola. 1. Powered by the Almond- Real food powered by the natural goodness of our California-grown almonds. I think this range wins by connecting directly with almonds front and center. The core business and equity from blue diamond are the almonds so centering on them as the ""hero"" of the story  helps positions the whole range. I like how it talks about real food (vs quick fixes)  and the added nutrition that comes from integrating almonds.
2. if you want this range to grow beyond food you could change eat better to Live better, but if you focus only on edibles you can leave it as is I think it is a very well developed concept that can integrate many forms of almond foods. You could eliminate the ALMOND FLOURS and make it Almond products- in this way you do not limit yourself to only flour based alternatives.
3. anything that has almonds on the center :) I think you have done a great job, specially on the range part- I think that highlighting almonds as the center of your concept, and staying focused on the perceived health and nutrition benefits is super important. Having clear core values: ingredient, growers, family- is more compelling than- quick fixes, easy to make, convenience-
anything can be quick or convenient, but not every product is anchored on a legacy, enables family producers to thrive and provides nutrition for your family. I would stick to those 3 core values and always gravitate to and from them.",Hollywood,ENFJ
304828,Kristen,Brotemarkle,kristenbrote@gmail.com,"1. I like the concept - I'd want to know that it was something healthy and a ""good"" or ""wise"" or ""smart"" choice for a quick dessert or snack. The whole ""Just add water and microwave for 60 seconds"" feels a little fast food like to me. I generally stay away from microwave food unless I know it's made with good ingredients or has some other justifier. 

2. A smart choice to satiate your hunger and sweet-tooth, this gluten-free treat made with wholesome ingredients will leave you smiling and full. Great taste without the waste was #3. To be honest I only really like the choices 1-2 I made, but 4-6 I didn't like so 3 was the middle ground 

#2.  I like the idea of something being clean and not having to do dishes. ""avoid unnecessary waste"" made me think this is smart to avoid cooking and cleaning. If there is the less environmental waste component but in that case I'd want to know if this was recyclable or what it's made out of - because buying individually packaged good is actually not good for the environment (usually). I do like the phrases ""great tasting cakes"" and ""highest quality ingredients"" as being a part of it.  

#3. See above comment, is this less waste for the environment? If you take the low waste angle I'd cross-reference it with the zero-waste/low-waste movement that cares are creating less waste in the world, so is this a compostable container.

4. I'm at home, looking for a late afternoon snack or after dinner, and I either have somewhere to go or have been working so don't want to go to the trouble of cooking something from scratch or cleaning up. Also, I could be traveling and at a hotel or something, I can microwave this without worrying about having cooking materials. I'm by myself in this case or maybe with a friend if I'm traveling. I feel like a TLC because I need an afternoon pick me up/snack that i want to taste good but not spike my blood sugar or be full of processed ingredients/sugar. I want to have a good moment in my afternon, even a highlight of my day food wise, without the 1 hr it takes to bake something and then clean it up. 1. I loved ""Plant-forward Goodness"" in fact I think my 1st and 2nd choice are a tie as I love them both!

2. I love that it leads with it being a healthy choice. When you are in the food aisle and looking at treats to know that this is a wholesome choice stands out for me 100%. I loved the first line too about a decadent cup that will lift you up without bringing you down. Mentioning gluten-free and dairy-free was  a huge pull for me here. I'm a big fan already. (Opposed to the other ones). 

I also love the 3rd paragraph that says ""freshly baked"" - even though it's a mircowave cup it's cool to think of it as fresh and bakd. 

3.  I don't see it being improved I honestly love this one. Other words you could play with would be ""quality"" and ""wholesome"" or organic (if that's the case) but those would all be expanding on the current theme.

4.
I am at home enjoying my TLC, or maybe I am on a road trip or travelling. I imagine staying at a hotel during a roadtrip and being able to bring this as there are microwaves in most hotels and motels. Though I for sure see having this at home, too.

I feel excited (!) for my TLC. How it is described makes me feel like it is light so I can enjoy it without weighing me down - that's how I feel if I had a full pastry or something heavy. So I could eat this at 11am for a late morning snack or even sometimes for a late breakfast, or an afternoon snack without feeling like I'm straying away from my healthy eating commitment. I'm definitely excited. I feel like this would make me feel better and energized from the food and nutrition and protein. 

I'd eat it late morning as a snack or afternoon as a snack, or if I'm traveling - like on a ski trip or a road trip- I imagine packing it for a post-dinner dessert.

I'm generallly by myself in all of these scenarios - expect for when I'm traveling, I may be on a ski trip with my family or friends and be able to make 3 of these for an easy dessert choice! 1. ""Naughty but Nicer"" As much as LOVED plant-forward goodness, I felt this one may actually hook me more as a consumer because it's unique and speaks to my desires of having something delicious but still ""good""/nice.

2. I like the dichotomy of eating something decadent if I'm assured it is healthy or good for me too. So I liked the duel pull of ""naughty/yummy"" and nice/protein/almonds.

3. What I think would really improve this idea would be if you expanded on why this was nice. Just saying this is a nice choice due to the california almonds doesn't make sense to me when you could highlight gluten-free or dairy-free. It'd be great if you could add that into the languaging. Like an ""indulgent treat that is gluten-free and packed with the nourishing goodness of California almonds.""

4.
I am at home in the afternoon or evening.

I feel hungry!! I also maybe feel a little stressed or wanting something yummy to treat myself at the end of the hard day - maybe I did a hard workout that day or ate healthy all day or had a long day at work. 

It is 3 or 4 pm (ie. late afternoon snack/pick me up - like instead of coffee but a few hours before dinner) or it is 7:30, 8pm after dinner - I'm still hungry and want something satisfying AND satiating. Since it has almonds/protein I feel it would make me full and prevent the endless trap of nighttime snacking. Like watching a movie and having dessert - it's easy to have 3 servings of a snack or something if it's not filling and mindlessly eat. This way I'd be treating myself to a fun dessert but I would know I would actually feel FULL after eating it. 

I am alone or I am with my roommates or family- we just all ate dinner together and a few of us are making TLC cups to eat while we watch movie

Now that I'm writing out all of these details I think my 2nd choice ""plant-forward goodness"" is a bit more versatile - I wrote that I could see myself having it as a late AM snack, as an early afternoon snack, as a brunch choice, dessert, etc. --- whereas this option I think is more obviously dessert and later day only snack. 

I feel like a TLC as I said above - I am hungry but I also maybe felt stressed and wanted to eat something nourishing and comforting. 1. As I said, when filling this out I realized my second choice (plant forward goodness) may be stronger than the first (naughter and nice) because I could see myself eating the plant forward goodness TLC at more times of the day. However, Naughty/Nice may be a bigger reason to buy if I feel it satisfies a craving/urge I get at the end of the day - this way I can satisfy it in a healthy way. 

2. N/a (just above) 

3. I recently signed up for Green Chef with my family. I loved that it makes having unique, diverse meals easy and it keeps us on a healthy eating plan. What I love about their ads is 1) it generally came with a coupon so that made me more eager to sign-up and 2) the food looks so good!! Healthy but also mouthwatering. Maybe having more photos of the cake itself - like on a fork or someone eating it - could be more enticing in the digital ads. 

Also - there could be a space for making a Keto TLC in the future too - which may sell well. 1. I'd lean in if they maybe had a unique flavor that looked mouthwatering or delicious - but also if they highlighted whole ingredients. In my case that would mean - gluten free flour filled with nutritous almonds and no processed sugar.

2. Wow you friends with your next colorful (or tasty) baking creation that is made whole wholesome, satisfying ingredients like almonds and no processed sugar. 1. Quality You Can Trust 

2. I think when it comes to baking mixes Quality is something that really stands out to me and something I'd be looking for. I feel like most baking mixes or baked goods are usually overly processed cheap, or lower quality. To see something that is ""high quality"" or ""quality I can trust"" definitely stands out in the baking world and would be worth my investment. 

3. I'd probably still include in it that it is gluten-free or healthy, I know it says wholesome but besides being high-quality and almond base - what would make me choose to buy it is knowing it was also either plant-based or gluten-free. I do like the last line saying 'quality home baking with a healthy twist'! But I guess I'd wonder ""why"" is this healthy - is it just almonds in addition to regular flour

4. 

I am at home in my kitchen where I usually bake, or I've brought this over to a friends house for us to bake together.
I am in a decent mode but maybe looking for a pick me up activity. I usually bake when I want to be in a happier mode  - either to enjoy the treat, share with others, or the process itself is enjoyable/meditative. 
If it's the weekend it might be as early as 12 or 1pm, but I usually bake in the late afternoon or the evening.
I often bake for an event or to share it so that is why early afternoon is good. I bake on Sundays frequently as well as an activity then have a treat to enjoy during the week
I am by myself, or I brought this to bake with a friend before a party at her house or at a friends house.
I feel like Blue Diamond Bake Mix because I want something that is quick and easy to make - a unique and delicious flavor - but something I know I can eat. I hate baking something that is full of sugar and white flour and not being able to enjoy the finished product! Knowing it's high quality means I'm proud to share it with friends and also happy to eat it myself. The health component is key for me. 1. Baking Together With Love 

2. Interestingly enough, I didn't choose this one for myself but I think in general it would be a very popular choice. Personally, I don't bake a ton with family members, but I hope to one day. Once I'm a mom I see myself baking frequently for AND with my kids - and I'd love to bake something that I know I am happy they are eating (that wont cause a crazy blood sugar spike etc.) but is nutritious. I think baking together is a great activity for family and for friends.

3. I think such a benefit of the baking mix is it's 1) easy and 2) healthier than the non-almond or gluten heavy counterpart. when you focus on baking with the family I feel a lot of parents would care about sharing healthy treats. So it's not just an activity but a wise parenting more. I know when I bake for my family and friends I want it to TASTE unhealthy but actually be good for you. 

4. 

I see myself baking this with my mom, for a party we're having or for having family over. I also see myself sharing this with friends. I am excited to share my baked good with friends and family so there is definitely joy, as well as the ease of baking with another person so I'm not doing it alone. Not to mention a baking mix which is SO easy.

I see myself doing this before dinner - since it's easy maybe 5 or 6 pm making it, popping it in the even as I make dinner or hang out with family, and taking it out to cool while we eat dinner and then it's like viola - the baked good is ready to share. 1. Tasty Treats to Share

2. I loved the first line: Bring joy to your friends and family with freshly baked favourites that everyone will love.  But I was also hooked with the tagline. I love bringing baked goods to parties and potlucks. I also really like when I know I can enjoy the baked good too. I generally don't eat gluten or high-sugar products so if this was a more healthy baking mix I'd be sold knowing 1) it's healthy and 2) the marketing that it's a good treat to share. When you bring something that looks fresh/home baked I feel like people think you really care. <3 

3. I think you should add the word ""wholesome"" in. Like the last line ""Share the love with these delicious home baked, *wholesome* treats that ..."" To be honest there are already a lot of other baking mixes on the market. Seeing that this is a tasty treat to share hooks me but what is going to make me actually buy it is if I think this is wholesome and healthy. So I'd add that in (wholesome, healthy, almond-based) or else I'm going to move onto the next product. 

4. 
I'd want to use this to bring to my friend's potlucks or parties (they have seasonal parties around the holidays) but also to a brunch! The tagline here makes me feel this is something really joyful and inviting to bring. I'd feel excitement in baking them in anticipating how my friends will respond. So I'd feel anticipation and happiness baking it and then JOY and LOVE when I share them. I imagine sharing a cake or muffins over a table outside for a Sunday brunch with friends. My contribution is thoughtful and well-received - and delicoius! It makes me feel warm and thoughtful that I made such a great contribution to the potluck, and also grateful and present as I enjoy it. It's great that I was able to share something fresh and home-baked, especially since it may have not been doable if I made it from scratch. 

Often I don't spend 1-2 hours preparing things so I'd buy healthy baked goods from the store instead. I feel like making this baking mix so I get to feel that joyful and happy feeling of sharing with friends, as well as the delicious taste I know and love, and the ease of making it at home in only a few steps  - much easier than other baking from home. 1 & 2. My final thoughts is that I really want to emphasize the strongest ideas for me revolved around sharing with friends/family (or baking with friends/family). However - there are already options on the market for this so it is vital to still include in packaging and messaging the health components (gluten free, plant based, almonds/high protein/whole ingredients). Honestly - if you marketed this as being a treat to share but I also noticed it was healthy AND easy to make (since it's a baking mix) I honestly see bringing this into my regular shopping list and using it as my go-to for bringing to parties or baking for family breakfasts/desserts. 100% the strongest idea I've seen in this study - though I liked the TLCs too! 

3. I recently purchased a tea/superfood (coffee replacement) drink by MUD\WTR due to their Facebook ads. I love their conversational/hip tone, I feel like they know me and my world. I also feel like they care about my health - in this case I wanted to get over my coffee addiction and drink something that would make me feel energized and focused. I liked the languaging they used and it just felt like a cool brand with a healthy product. 

I even used the sticker they sent me ""F*** your coffee"" because I loved it so much - I hate the coffee addict culture - and put it on my laptop! And I never put brands stickers on my laptop or anything like that. 

Here is their FB page so you can see their tone/language/voice:
https://www.facebook.com/pg/drinkmudwtr/posts/
I don't have a screenshot of the FB ad as that was weeks ago but I will share a few product/design screenshots which may help. 1. I like that it mentions plant-based and almond - which suggests it is grain free and/or gluten free. Highlighting these two qualities, and being easy to bake, would be my preference. Also, I'm not sure what your plans are with the sweetener -but I'd be more apt to buy it if it had a lower glycemic or organic sweetener (ie. not corn syrup or cane sugar) but instead coconut sugar, stevia, monk fruit, etc. That would make it excell as a top product in my eyes that'd I'd for sure by regularly.

2. Muffins to share with the whole family, plant-based and made with almond flour to give you a high-quality, gluten-free treat! (or   -easier to make than ever before!) 1. Plant-forward Mornings

2. 'Start your day right' - is my favorite tagline here! I love ALL of my top 3 concepts so much, I love how each focuses on the 3 components important to me 1) plant-based and healthy 2) a great way to start your morning with NUTRITION. I love that it says ""Delicious nourishment that lifts you up"" and ends with ""highest quality gluten-free and diary-free ingredients"". These all definitely caught my attention the most.

3. I think adding the word easy would be a great addition without over complicating it. Simply saying ""Enjoy the delicious taste of freshly baked
muffins made **easily** highest quality gluten and dairy-free ingredients."" or some addition there, so it's clear the baking mix is easy.

4. I'd probably make these in my kitchen the night BEFORE I needed them (I wouldn't want to wake up at 6am to bake). Maybe it's Sunday and I'm meal prepping for the week so this can be my breakfast all week, or likely it is Friday or Saturday afternoon or evening and I'm making them to enjoy on the weekend and any leftovers that make it I'd use for breakfast! I also like that these are positioned as being healthy, I feel like I could make them to eat for braekfast but would easily keep them as a snack too. It makes me feel satisfied and proud to be making a smart choice and to be using a kitchen, very adult/productive of me instead of just buying already made treats at the store which feel processed, or spending $4 on a muffin at a coffee shop.So I feel proud and happy that I'm going to enjoy YUMMY breakfasts all week that fit into my healthy regimen. I'm probably baking them myself but open to sharing them with roommates, friends, etc. 1. Muffins made easy

2. As I said, I loved all these 3 concepts. I actually feel this one is tied for first place because I love it. I think life is so busy that if I can eat healthy, save time, AND still feel like I'm doing something unique and special - it's win win win. ""Fuss free"" and ""Delicious home baked muffins made easy.."" were the two lines I liked the most. I felt the rest was sort of repetitive and I already was sold when I first read that. 

3. I think the second half of the ad is a little repetitive. I think you could take out the last line since you already said it was made easy. You could make it inviting and appealing in another way, like ""wow your friends"" or ""stay healthy and strong without all the work"" like say it in a different way. 

4.  Where am I - I am at home to bake these, but I imagine packing these with me for all sorts of occasions. Going to work, going to the park with friends, going on a hike (!!), if I was a student packing it in between classes. I get a much more ""conducive for life on the go"" feel with this theme, which I love. I often want to pack a snack with me for hikes or when I'm driving somewhere/gone all day. It makes me feel prepared and well-equipped, organized and responsible, and happy that I'm setting myself up for success (the oppositive is feeling lost or disorganized or worried I'll be hungry later and without a healthy snack, so I will end up buying something unhealthy or eating something unhealthy at work). 1. A Quality Start Your Day

2 . This is ultimate, what hits my 'pain point' the most. Trying to eat healthy breakfasts can get very boring. And yet, I know that I want to eat healthy/the first half to the day most of all. it sets me up to feel good and feel nourished, have stable energy levels, and not be plagued to carb fatigue or energy spikes from something full of sugar. My favorite line was: ""Its love in carbs and high protein, fibre, and good fats as away to set you up for the day ahead"". I'm actually doing a low-carb diet now so that's good to know. 

3. I think it's pretty stellar as is. I love the emphasis on health/nourishment, starting my day right, and good fits.  Maybe affirm that the muffin mixes are simple - that can help someone feel like even *they* could cook it the night before if they're not big bakers. Also, I'm not sure if almonds are a superfood? I'd check on that before using the wording as it sounds misleading. 

3. I would definitely be baking them and then eating them in the morning before work, or on the weekends for a late breakfast. I 100% see myself wanting to eat this for breakfast most days of the week. I also feel like it makes a great option for bringing food to a weekend brunch or potluck. My friends have potluck brunches sometimes and I hate showing up as the picky eater who can't enjoy anything. I also want to make sure what I bring is tasty/my friends will enjoy it - so bringing yummy muffins that I know I can enjoy for breakfast makes me feel RELIEF of knowing I can enjoy the brunch spread, too, and pride for bringing that is home-baked. I feel like using blue Diamond Muffin Mix because it is high quality so if my friends asked me if I baked it form scratch I can say I used a muffin mix but that it was high-quality and made with wholesome ingredients. 1. As I said-  I liked all my top three. I do think to mention that you are HIGH QUALITY would set you apart from other competition, provided you do use high-quality ingredients. I know many people like myself are concerned with our sugar intake so if this says ""healthy' but then had 20g sugar per serving I'd be very wary. I'd recommend using a healthy sweetener, or at least organic, and mentioning that within the ad wouldn't hurt. I think focusing on easing muffins and high quality is a great foundation though.

2. I'd saw on top on the two ads I already included, it can be good for digital ads to offer a coupon or discount code. I often ""fall for that"" - trying a new product on brand because they either offer a 50% off sale on the first purchase or maybe even a free product plus shipping. I just bought a Blush brand CBC gummie last week because they looked interesting, had a health benefit I've been seeking, and offered the first order only Shipping and Handing (it is a membership from there I believe). So offering a good discount to start is a good call. 

I don't have an image of this as I bought it last week and didn't screenshot the ad since it was before I started these activities.. 1. Faster Fixes, ""quality food that's fast and delicious"" - this is definitely a huge benefit of these products and I think the biggest differentiator, that the food is high quality and also easy/quick. So I think this direct take on a huge benefit (and pain point of consumers is great)

2. I think there could be a greater emphasis on the quality food = healthy, good nutrition. You say 'satisfaction and flavour of home cooking' but that doesn't mean it's good for you. As much as I want something fast and easy, the more I think of something as fast food the more I will turn away. I want it to be easy but only if I also know I am getting something nutritious and satisfying on a health level too.

3. I see frozen meals being great for this, like a frozen almond flour pizza or almond crusted fried chicken. Almond cereal would be awesome too - or an almond based paleo/keto granola as a fast and healthy breakfast. 1. Plant-forward Favorites, I love that this IMMEDIATELY focuses on making a healthy, wholesome, plant-forward choice. I personally am not vegan but am always inclined to eat more plant-based food, I tell most people I eat mostly plant-based. This seems like a miracle of a product - I can eat plant forward/plant based, while not spending an hour in the kitchen. I love it. The first tagline was great ""Deliciously nutritious plant-forward food"" as well as the line ""The highest quality almonds and natural ingredients for you to enjoy great tasting foods as part of your plantforward lifestyle."" I feel like it was written for me/is speakng to me! 

2.  I don't know if it could be improved - I think it's amazing as is! I'd so buy it. The only thing I'd say is I feel the messaging is so starong around high quality, nutritious, plant forward that you would only need to put ""dairy free"" or ""gluten free"" as messages on the packaging. Like it wouldn't need to be within the messaging but could be a bonus attribute when someone is looking at it. I feel this concept is super strong!

3. I see this being frozen or ready made meals - like a vegan pad thai (Amy's does that) or a snack plate (could be a almond and cheese with some veggies) 1. From Orchard to Table. I love the word orchard here - it really drives home the natural/wholesome/organic feel. It is similar to the Amy's video I shared where they focus on the whoelsome farming aspect and really focusing on the ingredients. It makes it feel ""farm to table"" and more luxury when you say orchard. I also think it's great you added at the end ""Enjoy the nutritious, farmfresh goodness we all know and love."" because to me it's not just about being wholesome/from the farm but also NUTRITIOUS as you could have a 800 calorie meal that is also from the orchard, but I want to be health-minded.

2. As I said above, it's good to tie in health and nutrition. I think using nutritious is sufficient here. However, I'd also use ""easy"" or ""make it yourself"" - maybe not fast/quick as that deters from the more luxury, farm to table feel, but maybe ""make it with ease"" or orchard to table ""meals you can make with ease and enjoy from your home.""

3. I definitely see vegetables being a part of these offerings, even though the orchard refers to Almonds, I see it needing to have veggies. Maybe ready to eat or frozen bowls - like with quinoa or rice and then veggies like broccoli and bok choy but it could have almonds on it for a crunch, or have almond dressings or almond croutons on a salad. I also think the almond granola could stil work here, too. And any future ideas like almond-milk based smoothie could be great. Like an almond-based green smoothie that also has spinach and blueberry could be great here. I think the 1st and 2nd choices here (orchard to table and plant-forward) are both SO strong I'd want to buy 100%. I think if you include the ease aspect in both that would make them slightly more appealing, but not leading with it, since ease/quick can be taken as fast food and unhealthy. Leading with quality and orchard to table makes this a more luxury item you could even share with your family members. For frozen foods I'd try to have lower sodium, just because if something is wayyyy too high in sodium I wouldn't consider it healthy (final tip).",Hollywood,
198815,Sophie ,Lee,buddhaness@yahoo.com,"1. Eye catching, beautiful modern design. Bonus if it’s motion graphics, perhaps in a video format with great sound. 
2. Take time for yourself and celebrate life with a decadent treat. Indulge yourself, in a easy convenient and healthy way. 1. Plant forward goodness 
2. The concept of Decadence & quality. I liked the notion of GF & DF but the emphasis is placed on “decadent” and “lift” and highest quality. All words I really resonate with.
3. Really don’t like “plant forward cake”. Makes me think of greens. That name doesn’t make me think decadence. I think of green cake which doesn’t make sense to me and I don’t want to try it. Maybe words like nourishing, that speaks to the body and complimenting diff dispositions is better.
4. At office or at home. Taking a break from work in the afternoon or at night after dinner. Alone by myself. Time for an easy to digest treat. 1. Quality you can trust
2. High quality ingredients is always a top priority so the words like “finest, natural, quality, trust” jumped out. Additionally really liked the words “scrumptious, lovingly” that communicated a mood and care.
3. Would change the word “great” tasting. That almost says nothing. Great is like “nice”. I’d swap it for something like delicious tasting, or deliciousness in a cup.
4. Again either at office or home, afternoon or after dinner. By myself or possibly with a friend. Time for a pick me up and or time to indulge and it’s dessert time. 1. Naughty but nicer
2. Loved this one because can relate 100% and this is what I look for. Esp words like indulgent  treat, nourishing goodness. Highest quality ingredients, rich taste experience, natural nourishment. Yes yes yes.
3. Indulgent repeated 2x here. Swap 1 out for scrumptious or decadent. 
4. At home. Afternoon tea or after dinner. Dessert treat time alone. Or with a girlfriend. Time to relax and enjoy alone time or bond over “dessert” and conversation with a girlfriend. 1. More negative space/minimal modern in design. Less clutter, less to read. Motion graphics for pop and attention grabbing.
2. Personally, I don’t use microwaves because I’m concerned how it may change the molecular structure of the food and alter the quality and nutrients. So I wonder if there’s alternative ways of eating this for people who may not microwave.
4. I noticed this Instagram ad for its cleverness and the way they structured their campaigns: marketing. It felt fresh, youthful, great sense of humor and fun. 1. The overall design look and feel that feels friendly, modern & fun.
2. Delish healthy baking at home during lockdown? and Vegan, gluten & dairy free? Here you go. 1. Plant Forward Favorites
2. I like that it's gluten & dairy free. Words like ""highest quality"" and ""delicious nourishment"" spoke to me.
3. Don't love ""plant forward."" Feels a bit pretentious or robotic. 
4. Home alone, can see myself baking around noon post workout, afternoon for a snack. Blue Diamond Baking Mix feels like it would be healthful and nourishing for my body. The quality of ingredients matters to me. 1. Quality you can trust
2. ""Wholesome goodness"" and ""sourced directly"" are quality words I like.
3. Quality home baking with a twist... what's the twist? Will there be suggestions for additional fresh ingredients the customer can personalize to their mix?
4. At home, alone around noon or afternoon. Time for some comforting alone time. Make myself a turmeric or matcha latte. and have the oven going with the Baking Mix cuz it feels like it'd be healthy. I'd add fresh ingredients to amplify or spice up the mix. 1. Fuss free favorites
2. This concept was most fitting for quarantining at home alone so it resonated most. Particularly liked ""maximum enjoyment"" and ""homemade baking made easy""
3. Don't love the word ""fuss."" Easy breezy is better. A comforting word. Nothing that alludes to stress. People are stressed out/on edge enough.
4. Alone backing at home, throughout the day. Love baking now esp to scent up the apt... adds a sense of comfort during this unpredictable time. 1. If the verbiage can be even more concise and impactful. Feels like theres too many words to grab my attention on Insta. Almost a graphic, bold visual approach to get my attention.
2. Speak to baking alone, esp many people can't share with loved ones the baking experience now that we are still in lockdown or not able to be in physical presence with each other as much. 1. Feeling not alone, understood, fun, easy companion activity to do.
2. Home alone? Bake for yourself and the smell of comfort. Healthy decadence that's good for your body and the planet. 1. Muffins made easy
2. Made easy for Maximum enjoyment. Yes please. 
3. I don't like the word fuss. Again it makes me feel think of stress or mess. I love the simplicity and ease of this concept.
4. Muffins I associate with mornings/breakfast. I'd bake it in the morning after working out... to enjoy/eat around 11 or noon alone since I do intermittent fasting and don't eat until noon. Blue Diamond Muffin mix cuz it's almond based with healthy ingredients and no crazy terrible additives/preservatives. 1. Bake Now, Enjoy Later
2. I have been baking/cooking and freezing since I've been on solo lockdown so this concept made me feel understood and related to. Bake now, freeze later. 
3. Include par bake instructions so that when I reheat it later, it will feel freshly baked to perfection. So perhaps I batch bake to 80% done and have instructions to finish baking/reheat at 20% for ultimate freshness/deliciousness.
4. I'd be baking any time in the day or night. Perhaps meal prepping for the coming week so I'm pre batch baking. Alone, meal prepping for the week ahead. 1. A Quality start your day
2. Liked the word superfood, kickstart the day. As well as the benefits of low carb, high protein, fibre, good fats.
3. I don't like the word right... too judge-y or preachy. Perhaps speak into the concept of the supportive, high functioning morning routine. 
4. Muffins I associate with mornings/breakfast. I'd bake it in the morning after working out... to enjoy/eat around 11 or noon alone since I do intermittent fasting and don't eat until noon. Blue Diamond Muffin mix cuz it's almond based with healthy ingredients and no crazy terrible additives/preservatives. 1. I hope there will be both savory and sweet muffin flavors on offer.
2. If there will be savory, I can see the muffin mix being used throughout the day, as opposed to mostly geared towards the morning.
3. Nuggs like I had previously shared. It was fresh, memorable, fun and it made me want to buy the faux chicken nuggets! 1. The sense of community. Supporting businesses that share similar values. Especially now with the virus, supporting local, supporting good people I believe in is even more of a priority for me than before. Brands who take care of their own people and their customers. Made with love is a phrase I always like. As cheesy as it may feel, I believe intention makes a difference and when I read that on packaging it's always a plus.
2. I like the addition of functional, superfood ingredients. If it's a mix, I like seeing additional thoughtful combos that make the mix extra special. Something that adds to why I would buy this mix and differentiate it from if I just bought the ingredients myself and made it from scratch.
3. Boxed flavored dry almond pastas, almond superfood latte powder mixes From Orchard to Table
1. I like that it's a feel good concept. Simple. Straight forward. Down to earth. Whole food, sun-soaked goodness, grown with love, nutritious, farm-fresh are all pluses.
2. If this can be organic or somehow convey the highest quality of ingredients are used in the mix. Biodynamic practices... processes that convey thoughtfulness and consideration on the farm level.
3. Again the almond superfood latte mixes, Soup mixes that I can imagine being cooked on the farm. Powered by the Almond
1. Real food, Superfood are always keywords i respond to. Especially superfood. Nutritious boost. Best quality.
2. Add High Functional. Real food superpowered. 
3. Morning/PM superfood latte mixes with like collagen, probiotics, spirulina, adaptogens. Dessert mixes with superfood ingredients. Now I'm really obsessing over the idea of SUPERFOODS as the foundational concept for the range.",Hollywood,INFJ
313400,Alejandra,Garcia,lalelugo@gmail.com,"1. An innovative product that is addressing a message for a healthy lifestyle, using a catchy color palette and with an introductory offer to appeal even more.

2. For my next trick I'll just need a few drops of water, close my eyes for some secs and... voilâ, Tasty Little Cups! 1. I put 'Craving Convenience' in 3rd place.

2. What made me take notice was at first the phrase 'fleeting moments' and I liked the words/phrases 'crave, convenient, and big on taste.'

3. Perhaps I'd only change the phrase 'delicious cake' for 'deliciousness in a cup in just 60 seconds' because I think it's a convenient word that can stick to this concept instead of having two words. Besides, in the third paragraph there's the explanation of the product where the words delicious and cake appear.

4. I'd definitely be at home because I need a microwave to make it... but, wait.... I don't have one. So, I'd also think about including the pot option in the cooking method for those without that appliance. I'd be feeling a crave for something sweet, and that I want it to satisfy my need of indulgence. It'd probably be midday, or later like 6-7. I'd be with my hubby and we might have finished lunch, so we'd want a dessert. 1. Quality You Can Trust

2. 'Quality and scrumptious' made me lean in and take notice. The words I like are 'scrumptious, cooperative, family-owned growers.'

3. I'd take the first 'cake' leaving only 'Quality in a cup in just 60 seconds'. And I'd also say: 'Scrupmtious cake lovingly made with the finest almond flour from our cooperative of family-owned California growers.' Perhaps, I'll also make a note on 'know how this TLC is lovingly made in 60 seconds... (and I'd explain here the great taste) and... ready to be enjoyed!' or something like that.

4. I'm thinking about a pic-nic and that there's a kiosco around to buy TLC. I'd feel I want a treat due to the nice weather and company. It'd be 3-4 and I'd be with my friends. And I'd like TLC because of its innovative product made with love/quality. 1. Plant-forward Goodness

2. 'Plant forward & decadent' made me take notice. Decadent is a word that's not commonly found, just like plant-based products with quality ingredients. I liked 'lifts you up ... bring you down & freshly baked cake'.

3.  I might put: ""Delicious decadent dessert in a cup that lifts you up without gluten or dairy to bring you down."" And I'd avoid repetition of 'decadent' in the third paragraph.

4. I'd be at home, feeling like a decadent dessert with no gluten or dairy. It'd be at night, preparing delicious food to enjoy while watching a TV series or a flix. I'm alone and I'd feel like a TLC because I wanna have something sweet and plant-based in the right proportion. Perhaps, I'd include onomatopeias such as yummy to attract the attention of the viewer and make them wanna see what product is about. I'd play with the idea of reading one part of the mug cake pot in only 60 seconds to make the simile with the preparation time. 

3. What made me chose this ad was the name of the brand that would be translated as 'our root' because it transports me to nature, origin. Then, the colors, blue and white combined with the two jars, lured me because they transmit relaxation, health. Finally, who doesn't like something FREE? I believe that's an unbeatable hook. 1. Perhaps words like 'plant based' 'baking mix' 

2. 'A mix of flavor with the most natural ingredients: high quality almond flour, ready to mix and bake. Baketastic!' 1. Tasty Treats to Share

2. 'care... share' took my attention. And 'bring joy to your friends and family' liked me.

3. I wouldn't repeat in the third paragraph the phrase 'bring joy to your whole family and closest friends' I might change it for 'make you and your beloved ones happy'. 

4. I'd enjoy them in a family reunion or a friend's gathering. I'd feel love for them and that I want to share them a bit of happiness. It would be in the afternoon or supper time. I'm with my whole family or closest friends, as it's put in the concept, and I'd feel like this mix because I'd like to share an innovative product/flavor with my beloved ones. 1. Plant-forward Favorites

2. 'Alternatives to classic baked favorites' made me notice it as the second place. The words I liked are 'nourishment, lifts you up, freshly baked, gluten- and dairy-free.'

3. Almond flour alternatives to classic favorites. Nutritious, delicious, yummy! The rest of it is cool.

4. I'd be visiting a friend and got the idea to bake. Then, we'd go to the shop and find Blue Diamond Baking Mixes. I'd be feeling craving for something fluffy. It's afternoon, after lunch or a bit later, I'm with my bestie and we felt like this mix because it's plant-forward and we want our diets to be inclined more to green stuff. 1. Bake Together with Love

2. 'Together, love, share' made me notice and I liked 'share your love, classic favorite treats, shared moments, healthier food habits.'

3. Get your family to bake with fun and love to enjoy Baking Mixes. Together we are better. 

4. I'm at home and I feel like baking a cake. It's 11 am and I want to enjoy it in a family celebration. First, I'm alone because I'll prepare it for the whole family as a surprise. Then, when the cake is ready, I'm with my nuclear family gathered at the table. I felt lilke this mix because it's a different flavor I wanted to share and enjoy with my mom, dad, sisters, niece and nephews, brother-in-law, and husband. 1-2. It might work to include a lot of different muffins appearing one by one to then show Baking mixes concept. I believe the idea of love is great, specially beacuse you can have a connection with cooking together as a family or for the family or friends. 

3. I chose it because you could present different baking mixes flavors with different moods to choose from saying there's a healthy option for every occasion. 1. Its simplicity to express the message and a catchy phrase.

2. Mouthwatering Muffin Mixes. Try our pleasant-tasting plant-based new muffin mix from Blue Diamond. Greener, healthier, tastier. 1. Muffin Made Easy

2. Fuss free almond flour made me take notice. The phrases I like are 'home baked muffins, made easy, maximum enjoyment'.

3. I'd include a pun like Piece of Muffin, to play with the idea of 'piece of cake', easy as pie (or muffin) or easy peasy and won't repeat the words 'made easy' because it could avoid repetition.

4. I'd choose them for a time when I want an uncomplicated cooking experience. I feel like practical and I don't want any problem in my kitchen, but I'd like a sweet treat. It'd be night to bake them at that time and have them ready for the next day. I'm cooking alone but will share it with my significant other. I feel like this mix because I want to enjoy the fullest flavor of almond flour muffins. 1. Bake now, enjoy later

2. What made me notice was 'bake now, enjoy later' I believe this is a powerful phrase. I liked 'claim back your mornings!, bake these delicious muffins ahead of time, nourishing grab-and-go breakfast.'

3. Enjoy more your mornings with a nutritious muffin. Bake these wholesome muffins in advance for a healthy grab-and-go breakfast.

4. I'd be in the supermarket shopping all my food for the week and when I turned around and saw the Muffin Mix, I just wanted to go for it. Then, I'd bake them on Sunday to freeze and enjoy them during the week either for breakfast or dessert. I'd feel great because I'd have chosen treats that I can freshly taste throughout the week. It's night when I bake them, then when I have them either morning or afternoon. Then, I'm alone, preparing to go to work, and I grab my muffin to eat it on the go. I feel like this mix because it's practical and tasty. 1. A Quality Start Your Day.

2. I noticed Quality Start and I really liked 'high quality California-grown Almond Flour to give you everything you need to kick start your day.'

3. Quality=almond flour muffin mixes. Low carbs, high protein, fibre and good fats preparing you for the day ahead. 

4. I'd enjoy it at home or work because I like having healthy food and this indeed is healthful and beneficial for my mind and body. It'd be in the morning and I'm alone or with some colleagues. I'd tell them about these new muffin mixes and give them a bit. I feel like this mix because it encourages a more balanced diet, and at the same time care of your body and the planet itself. 1-2. I'd include the different flavors you have using animation on different screens and a swipe up button to find out more to create curiosity among the viewers and lure them to discover what else they have to offer, trying to incite people to know the product because it's amazing.

3. The first one because I think the phrase 'Muffin Mixes in one click' could attract more consumers, and if you animate the arrow, it's even more appealing. The second one to illustrate how you could include different flavors in different screens and perhaps playing with the copy/text, trying to vary it, not repeating the idea. 1. What made me lean in was the first line: 'Delicious food, easy to make, and ready to go' because it relates to a lifestyle which includes rush and health, which is iherent to today's society. Besides, I liked 'the ease of ready -to-eat foods, satisfaction and flavour of home cooking, almond flour fast fixes'.

2. By including the healthy factor, I think you should always mention it, if it applies, of course. Perhaps, I'd include 'Delicious fast food, easy to make, & ready to go' to put the idea of fast since the first line. 

3. I believe that a milk-shake could be great to accompany this range, it's not almond-flour but it could be made of almond milk. Also, something like almond 'yogurt' could be great. 1- As in previous activities, I think this concept of plant-forward could resonate more in consumers who look for a more sustainable diet. What made me notice was: 'deliciously nutritious plant-forward food'. I liked that you're considering 'classic favourites and tasty treats for a plant-forward lifestyle' and that the healthy factor is implicitly included in the next phrase 'without the gluten or dairy to bring you down'. 

2. Perhaps, I'd mention the word 'healthy' by the end of this concept like: 'The highest quality almonds and natural ingredients for you to enjoy great tasting foods as part of your healthy plant-forward lifestyle' sinceI liked the rest of the ideas. 

3. I might consider healthy bits, like balls of almond-flour covered with dark chocolate to lift you up and give you the boost you're looking for in a healthy snack. 1. First, the title: 'Powered by the Almond' was so catchy that it's my reason for having chosen this concept as the first place. Then, I liked 'real food, natural goodness of our California-grown almonds, eat better with almonds, the superfood that adds a nutritious boost to the food you eat'.

2. In the second line of this concept I'd include 'Eat better and healthier with almonds... 

3. Pasta made with almond flour. It could be interesting to taste it. 1-2. I'd like that the word healthy appear in your products because it could combine plant-forward and healthy, which will add on well-being, I believe this could be more compelling and I think that this is the concept that could be an important part of your marketing.",Hollywood,ENFP
198793,Natasha,Back,natasha_back@hotmail.com,"Natasha’s a good friend and a great listener who’s always there when you need her  This little pottery ornament was brought back from Columbia for me by a friend who went there for work. My mum who passed away nearly 8 years ago was born in Bogotá and I’ve never had the opportunity to visit yet, despite my love of travelling. This object reminds me of my Mum every time I see it, it reminds me of how special she and my family are to me and it also reminds me of how much I love to travel, and, that there’s a big wide world out there to be explored   This Size 4 rugby ball is one of the balls from my coaching kit. I coach my son’s U10 rugby team, Hampstead RFC, every Saturday from September to May. I love it! Aside from keeping me physically fit alongside my cycling, running and workouts, it’s brilliant for my mental well-being too. It gives me an opportunity to not just give back and help develop a love of sport within the children but I also learn a huge amount from them too, eg how we all have a place within the team regardless of strength & ability, how we all develop at a different rate, and just because we’re not the best right now doesn’t mean we can’t be with hard work and perseverance and how sport brings out the best in us all. Despite having to spend many weekends caked in mud and running around in the rain, I wouldn’t swap it for the world.   A hand written card from my kids. Something so simple that means so much. The older I get the less I want for material things  I love Mollusk Surf Shop based in Venice, California. They sell clothing, surf boards, books, prints, towels and accessories. I really love their clothes. They have a classic vintage feel while being innovative. The clothes are fresh, great quality and made with natural materials. They focus on sustainability which I feel is really important today. They come across as effortlessly cool

Food wise, we as a family love Little Moons mochi balls. The brand was created by brother and sister, Howard & Vivien Wong, in 2010, who were on a mission to bring Japanese mochi with a delicious, modern twist to the masses. 

I love that they’ve taken something traditional that means a lot to them and given it their own twist. The flavours are exciting and different, they really stand out. The packaging is fantastic, colourful, eye catching and classy and labelled really well. They’re dairy and gluten free, so they’ve thought about being inclusive and producing relatively healthy treats. Their bite sized mochi balls are divine and one or two are just enough to satisfy. They really place value on quality over quantity Success - you’re far more likely to enjoy success if you’re happy & healthy. It could be success in your career, in your relationship, in your hobby 
Longevity - I hope for a long life and the chances of this are massively increased by being healthy and happy
Freedom - a healthy and happy life grants you freedom; physically you’ll be able to carry on for longer, doing the things you love and mentally if you’re healthy and happy you’re less stressed and hopefully have fewer worries, meaning you’re free in mind Everything in moderation - I love food & drink and don’t want to ever not be able to indulge in a little bit of what I love. I also want my children to grow up loving food, exploring different tastes & traditions and don’t want them to be restricted 

I try to buy fresh food as much as possible and when I don’t I look at the labels to ensure that there aren’t any nasty additives, too much salt or sugar

I’ve always loved dairy products, I remember as a kid, coming home from school and drinking a pint of milk most afternoons, and I love cheese too but the past few years after lots of research I’ve realised it’s really not that great for us. In the past I’ve always felt there aren’t many really tasty substitutes which put me off trying them but recently I’ve been nicely surprised to see and taste for myself some really great dairy free products

I rarely look at calories so long as what I’m eating is natural and I’m fortunate that I’ve never had an issue with my weight, but having said that it’s quite nice for people to see how many calories are in things  Everything in moderation - I love food & drink and don’t want to ever not be able to indulge in a little bit of what I love. I also want my children to grow up loving food, exploring different tastes & traditions and don’t want them to be restricted. These treats are indulgent and promise to “elevate your day” with a “mouthful of artisan ice cream lovingly wrapped in soft mochi dough”   I try to buy fresh food as much as possible and when I don’t I look at the labels to ensure that there aren’t any nasty additives, too much salt or sugar. The packaging clearly states that there are no artificial flavourings, colours or preservatives, the mochi balls are dietary gluten free and they’re suitable for vegetarians & vegans   I’ve always loved dairy products, I remember as a kid, coming home from school and drinking a pint of milk most afternoons, and I love cheese too but the past few years after lots of research I’ve realised it’s really not that great for us. In the past I’ve always felt there aren’t many really tasty substitutes which put me off trying them but recently I’ve been nicely surprised to see and taste for myself some really great dairy free products. These are a great example of a brilliant dairy free product which I’d choose over a dairy product any day of the week  It’s often hard when you’re busy juggling kids, a career, and a dog to find the time to make things from scratch and sometimes the easiest solution is to order food in or get a ready meal. Sometimes you have to be flexible with your principles. Sometimes food isn’t labelled clearly and that can be frustrating and sometimes you go into a store and the choices available aren’t that great/healthy and you feel you are forced into buying something you wouldn’t ordinarily  I chose this brand, Biotiful Dairy, as it’s both healthy and convenient. They’re small bottles of Kefir which is the most powerful of all probiotic foods available today for gut health. Each Kefir shot is the perfect amount portion wise. It’s a source of vitamin B12 and has no added sugar. It tastes great too! The small bottles can be easily stored in the fridge and they’re easy to wash & recycle   I chose Doughlicious gourmet cookie dough because it instantly caught my eye in it’s good looking packaging and I was certain it would being me (and the kids if they’re lucky) joy. You get a sneak peak of the cookie dough through the packaging and it looks just as good as it says it is on the packaging. The fact they’ll be ready in 14-16 minutes without the hassle of preparation is a real selling point. They look like a healthy ish treat: no refined sugars, non GMO and gluten free. I did actually buy these and they haven’t disappointed!   The whole family is addicted to these mochi balls, so much so that I get the manager in our local store to put a couple of boxes aside for me as soon as they come in! I chose this as it’s a non-dairy brand yet it tastes just as good, if not better than dairy ice cream. It’s beautiful packaged, really well labelled, eye catching and alluring   This is the first time I’ve seen or heard of pea milk and from all the brands claims it looks too good not to try. I’d be intrigued to try it as I have no idea what it’ll taste like. It’s dairy free, claims to have 50% more calcium than cows milk and 8 grams of plant protein per glass. It’s sugar free and fortified with calcium, iodine and vitamins D & B12. It says it’s sustainable and it’s environmental footprint is tiny so by drinking it you’re helping the planet. They’ve packed a lot of information onto the packaging in a really easy to read way. The brands boasts are pretty impressive and persuasive and it sounds like a really exciting new alternative to dairy/oat/almond milk which we often buy   I rarely buy smoothies or juices as we tend to make our own. We have a juicer and a smoothie blender in our kitchen and I like being able to know exactly what goes into them and having the option to add and play around with ingredients  
 
The only shakes I buy are Shaken Udder milkshakes. These are great tasting good quality milkshakes that come in a range of flavours. The packaging and branding is brilliant and the bottles are fully recyclable. The brand also work hard to make their business as sustainable as possible. I buy these as a treat for the kids fairly regularly   We love nuts: cashews, almonds & walnuts, we buy these from the health food shop and they’re from Infinity Foods Organic, a workers co-operative established in 1971. Production of their organic range of foods follows strict organic standards and prohibit the use of any genetically modified crops or ingredients. I like to know our snacks are healthy and great quality. These nuts are all night in protein and good fats and are easy to take out in snack pots   
We love Whole Earth Crunchy Peanut Butter. We have this on toast, in smoothies, sometimes just a spoonful from the jar. Again it’s organic which is very important to us and it has no added sugar. The palm oil used in it is organic and sustainable. It’s high in protein and good fats. Even the dog loves this peanut butter 

Eat Natural - Crunchy Nut Bars. These great nut bars are again high in protein, really tasty. They’re great on the go, especially car journeys as they don’t make a mess, and they come in a wide variety of flavours. The brand is also seemingly working hard to become as sustainable as possible

 
   Trendy, high in sugar, all show   Great quality, healthy, responsible   reasonable, staple, consistent   The brand looks really wholesome. Each of the products look high quality, healthy and delicious. I love the recipe ideas on their Instagram feed, showing that their products can be used in a variety of ways and that they’re versatile. The snack drinks look AMAZING! I love that the brand has been voted Finland’s second most responsible brand and that they pledge to work hard for future generations and the environment. The brand clearly has a real social conscience, this is highlighted on Instagram with their donations to hospital workers during the pandemic and also their projects in schools. The brand looks really reputable & high end.   I would definitely buy this brands products. The brand is really compelling. It stands for everything I’d look for in food/drink products   The only thing that jumped out was how white/middle class the brand appears - this is not a criticism but if it wants to open its market and get a big share it needs to be seen to be more diverse I think. Scrolling through Instagram there was only one mixed race girl, giving out snacks.   To me it stands for quality ingredients, healthy choices, social & environmental responsibility ",Harvest,ISFP
382222,Marty,Doran,marty.doran@gmail.com,"I've been called Old Man Doran since I was in my early teens, so I think they'd describe me as exactly that - bit too pessimistic and grumbly, but I also don't really take myself all that seriously even sometimes when I probably should do.  In my early teens I got into metal, then into guitar and eventually into all my weirder interests . This guitar is the signature guitar of the guitarist from the band that piqued my interest in all that stuff many years earlier and I was overjoyed to get my hands on one for my 21st birthday. I think if forced to chose, the guitar is probably my favourite personal object, it ties all my interests in music and love of anything made in black
   In a sense no because I drink at least two peoples worth of coffee every day, but a lot of my favorite parts of the day are stepping away to spend too long making a cup of coffee. I enjoy the ritual aspect of doing it before work while getting in the headspace to approach my computer, of being able to step away when stressed and do something mindless for 5 minutes, and of making a cup after work and parking myself on the couch. I could easily make instant coffee a lot faster and wouldn't mind much, but I like the time it takes. Also, it makes me feel better instantly because I love coffee.
   I'm not even really much of a gamer, but reality is very boring at the moment. I tend to play every day for a little bit if I get bored, it's a nice bit of escapism with little brain work and energy involved. It often tickles the rewards center when you complete something a bit challenging which helps keep the mood up a little.
  I don't look too deeply into brand values very much unless a brand is particularly awful or particularly good. If a brand is particularly terrible for the environment I could give it a miss, and if a brand is donating profits to a good cause I am more inclined to buy that brand (because why not essentially?). When I'm shopping, I'm more inclined to buy something like meat alternatives/dairy alternatives if I'm made aware of the positive impact of making such a change, but it's not something I really hunt for. I try to be aware on some level that whatever is on the packaging outside regulatory information is marketing.

aybe I am more inclined towards environmentally friendly products/brands but I can't think of anyone in specific that I lean towards directly because of their values (not knowingly anyway, but maybe on some leve). However, I do like to buy from smaller or local  brands if the opportunity is there. With things how they are, I think it's good to support smaller local businesses and generally I think these new businesses have more of a focus on doing things like recycling correctly from the beginning. Chill - I like things to be as uncomplex as possible and can be sometimes feel a bit overloaded in complex situations. By 'chill' I mean the general state of things being nice and slow, easy going, and relaxing. I'm generally introverted so long periods of high energy can get me a bit tangled, I always look forward to the next kinda breating space where I can just slow down.
Food - I love food and drink of all kinds, love to try new things and revisit favorites. I love to have the delivery man bring food to me, though not always healthy. I enjoy cooking and the feeling of making something with fresh ingredients and knowing that I'm eating tasty, nutritious. Cooking feeds into my chill time sometimes too - similar to making coffee in a cafetiere, making something simple like a stew or a soup can be really relaxing for the hour it takes. On the other side, somtimes the best thing for your happy life is to order some very unhealthy food and let the healthy life take a backseat for an evening.
Company - I don't see many people these days with the restrictions, but I live with my girlfriend and she definitely helps keep me sane day-to-day and vice-versa. For inside hobbies like films and gaming, it makes it much better when sharing with someone than doing it all alone. We're conscious of eachothers mood and try to keep things upbeat where possible and not let the lockdown misery creep in too bad. Additionally, if I think back to the happiest periods in my life, it tends to be when the company was the best. Healthiness - sometimes I want to be healthier, sometimes I don't care so much. This definitely has an impact on what I buy. When I feel healthier I'm less inclined to buy meat and alcohol, I'll buy diary/meat alternatives, focus on vegetables and try to buy more fresh ingredients. If I'm not feeling particularly healthy, I'm more inclined to do the opposite. There's a visible difference in what we buy in the supermarket based on this.

Price - I would rather buy more healthy options sometimes, but with a lot of the vegetarian/vegan foods being smaller companies in more niche markets, the price often seems about 20-30% higher which is noticeable if buying a lot. In saying that, I don't go straight unhealthy for the price difference, but I'm less inclined to buy some products. For example, I love the Vegetarian Butcher, but when it's not on sale it's hard to justify the price

Time cost - it depends how much time I have available and how I feel like spending it. If I have a busy week coming up, I am less likely to buy ingredients and more likely to buy quicker meals (not often ready meals but faster meals like stuff to quickly toss in a wrap or something). Some weeks cooking can feel more like a hobby so I'm willing to spend more time on it, but others not so much and I want to eat without any fuss. In these cases I'll try to be healthy as I can but it's not a focus.

What my girlfriend wants - we have similar tastes but can be on different wavelengths regarding the above week-by-week. So regardless of what I think about the healthiness, price or time cost, if we're not totally in line I'm likely to deviate into what she wants. If she's feeling healthier or less healthy, I'm likely to follow her lead.  Healthiness - these cost quite a lot more than standard noodles and aren't as good, but they're keto friendly so we paid the higher price for these due to the health benefits when we were on the keto diet. If there were no health benefits theres no way I'd spend this much on noodles
   Time cost - we tend to make super healthy smoothies sometimes for breakfast, especially in the warmer weather where a cold breakfast isn't so weird. We pick up frozen fruit a lot for this purpose because it takes so little time to have a healthy meal, maybe 5mins max. 
   Price - are there more delicious, nutritious yogurts? Yes, absolutely, but for how much I value yogurts I don't care to spend much on them. Since they function only as a light snack a few times a week, I don't think it's necessary to break the bank on them  Lockdown - eating is essentially a hobby now, which is fine when you like cooking, but in the periods where you don't have the energy it's too easy to get takeaway. It's gone from a 'treat' activity to a simple alternative source for dinner. I find I can be real good for weeks but then get three dirty takeaways over a weekend which just leaves you feeling bleh. I used to be more strict when I went to the gym, but since lockdown that's not been possible so it's not been as easy to stay on the wagon. Generally one makes the other activity easier.

Work - my work is generally quiet with a few high peaks during the year which demand many extra hours. In these times, the last thing I want to do after work is go stand in the kitchen and cook dinner, so I'm more likely to pick the less healthy options. Working from home means no more set snacks per day in the office, your entire kitchen is within reach and you can have 10 bowls of cereal if you so wish.

Not strict enough - I don't want to get a takeout, but my girlfriend is dying for one, so we get a takeaway.

Boredom - the mind wanders to food  I love these - they're entirely made from cold pressed fruit with some cocoa which gives it a nice nutty, chocolate taste. I used to bring them to the office as a snack and found it better than bringing the other popcorn or oat bars in - they're cheaper and have less calories but I think they lack in any real nutrition and filling power. The Nakd bars are and have a bit more calories, but they are super delicious and have the added benefits of nutrition and being a lower environmental impact product.
   I discovered Cloudwater on a trip to York a few years ago and it immediately became a favorite brand - I chose it on a whim based on the cool branding, which would be how I pick 90% of the beers I drink. This one is entirely for taste reasons - because this beer (and others by the same brand) are much more expensive than alternatives, I really only get them a few times per year as a bit of a treat. So, when I do convince myself to pick one up, I do really look forward to slowly drinking it on the Friday after work and really enjoying the experience. Other drinks I don't really appreciate so much, but this is such a rare treat that I enjoy every last bit.
   I love Oatly, I worked my way through dairly alternatives last year and didn't find any of them really good until I got to oat milk and specifically this brand. Others are good, but Oatly is absolutely delicious, I could drink pints of it per day if I'd no restraint. It's the only milk alternative that is really good on it's own merit and not for how close it is to dairy milk. Oatly milk itself is delicious, but the chocolate oat milk is just on its on plane of existence, so so good. I love the brand presentation and packaging, it's quite simple but there's a very clear aesthetic which stands out from the other brands of the shelf (which all show some variation of milk being poured into a glass). If I see something is Oatly I'm way more inclined to buy it.
   I think this is new, but it might be that I just haven't noticed it before. I've mentioned above, I love Oatly products - the milk, yogurt, etc. so I really like the idea of the Oatly ice cream also. I've tried other dairy alternative ice creams before but they're all a bit... not good. I also adore salted caramel, so I'm almost terrified to buy this as I don't think I'll ever be able to stop eating it.
   We make our own smoothies using apple juice, soy milk and whatever fruit packs we pick up when shopping, this will usually be: Four Seasons Green Smoothie Mix (green fruit and veg)
 Four Seasons Exotic Smoothie Mix (pineapple, papaya, mango)
 Four Seasons Strawberry and Banana Smoothie Mix

We prefer this as the price is much lower per smoothie and we control what goes in. Generally will add matcha powder, chia seeds and cocoao nibs for added goodness. Store bought smoothies always seem to have a bit much sugar.
 
Which fruit packs we get depends on which shop really, dont have any particular brand preference
 
 
   Hummus - love hummus, will generally buy tescos own brand as it's surprisingly the tastiest we've come across. Will eat it with flat bread usually but often carrots or celery Peanuts - I'll generally pick up a bag of peanuts every couple of weeks and nibble when I'm a bit hungry. The high fat and protein content is good for energy levels and it quickly gets get rid of hunger for a little while
 Fibre One 90 Calorie Chocolate Fudge Brownie Bars - good for when you have a bit of a sweet tooth but can't justify real chocolate. They're not very filling, but scratch the chocolate itch when you have it.
 
   Sugar, fruit, green
   Taste, fun, cereal   Cheaper, vanilla, plant
   It looks like there's a fair variety of products and it seems to be a bit more colourful than other Oat-brands tend to be. I like the focus on fresh fruit/nutrition and the strong implication these products are easily transported and snack-y. The little recipes on instagram look like they're worth investigating too
   After watching the video and viewing the instagram, the variety of products would definitely draw me in and I'd give them a go (i'm looking at you oat, meusli rolls), but I don't think the advertising itself or branding would do very much for me otherwise   The advertising lays it on pretty hard that groups of teenagers love to sit around and eat oat products and smile at eachother, or that it's the oaty glue that holds families together. This isn't really new and is the same direction most healthy brands tend to take, but it puts me off a little bit since its so far from reality and seems aimed at a kind of marketing heartstring-pulling checklist. I think the brand design could stand out more, the type and colour seems a bit reminiscent of old school cereal which is good, but on a shelf it might look like it's just existed forever and not like a new offering
   Calm, connection, soaking in the moment, good robust nutrition.

324040,Abi,Buller,bullerabi@gmail.com,"My best friend would describe me as kind and gentle but with a funny and quirky side.  This notebook reflects me as a person because of my job role and hobby as a writer. Also the iridescent colour reflects my personal style and interests.   These yoga blocks are important to my health and wellbeing as they're a simple and versatile object that help support my at home exercise routine.   This blanket brings me joy every day because the colour really brightens my room and adds a homely touch. It also has the effect of a weighted blanket, which is useful for calming anxiety at night time.  Sweaty Betty is one brand that I feel really reflects my values. Their workout gear is comfortable, flattering and fashionable and their communications are accessible and encouraging. I find it refreshing that they communicate ideas around movement of all kinds and don't just take a one track approach. Stimulating - I feel happiest when I'm mentally and physically stimulated by the activities in my life. This encompasses both work and play. 

Connected - Meaningful connection is vital to feeling happy and healthy in life. This also extends to personal and professional relationships.

Empowered - A sense of confidence and empowerment means that I'm able to feel in control of my life and able make healthy decisions for my overall wellbeing. What will nourish my body?

What will support my mental state?

What will support my hormonal balance?  Supporting my body: I often eat Tofu as a form of protein to help my body feel strong and nourished. As a vegetarian, I feel it's important to support my body in this way. I really like the Tofoo brand because it's versatile, easy to cook, and available in different flavours.   Supporting my mind: I always feel so much better mentall when I eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. I sign up to Oddbox as a convenient and sustainable way of getting fresh and healthy products.   Supporting hormonal health: I've recently started tuning into my hormonal cycles more and becoming more aware of what my mind and body needs to feel energised during my period. It has really helped to avoid sugary drinks and caffeinated beverages like tea and coffee, instead opting for herbal and green teas like this one to make me feel alert.  Sometimes relying on fresh products and ingredients requires extra effort for cooking and preparing food. It can sometimes be a challenge to find the energy and motivation to cook healthy and interesting meals from scratch.  This oat milk is a bit of a staple product for me. I love the taste and the fact it has no sugar (some dairy alternatives seem to be unnecessarily sweet!). I use it to put in drinks, to make porridge and various cereals, so I find it a really healthy and convenient item to have in the fridge.   I'm slightly lactose intolerant so try to avoid most yoghurts and mousses, but this is a really good option for when I want a bit of a treat.   I don't eat very much dairy anyway, but I was drawn to this Starbucks iced coffee drink because it has a coconut milk option. A lot of ready-to-drink options seem to be soya or almond, but I think this one gives it a really nice flavour.   I haven't heard of this brand before, but I'm always keen to try non-dairy options. I was quite drawn to the packaging and the idea of 'seed milk'.   I really like Innocent juices - especially ones like Wonder Green and Berry Set Go. I really like the flavours and find that they give me a boost. Similarly, I also really like to buy Tropicana Multivitamin Boost, both for the flavour and the added benefit of vitamins. I've stopped buying smoothies because I find that they can be quite heavy and bloating.   I really like Nakd bars because I find them super tasty and convenient. It's a kind of guilt-free treat because a lot of the flavours taste like chocolate, cake or sweet flavours, but they're actually just made of dried fruits and natural flavourings.  I also like having wholemeal pitta breads, carrot sticks and houmous as a snack (I usually just buy the supermarket own brand!) I sometimes buy Eat Natural Protein bars to have before or after a run. I find these satisfy my cravings and give me energy for quite a long time.   Bold, tasty, fun   Convenient, healthy, expensive   Comforting, accessible, tasty   Now that I've seen the TV commercial, the brand makes a bit more sense to me and I like that it takes a wholesome, family-centric approach.   It doesn't seem like the most intersting brand. Perhaps something which is more homely and more of a tradition for family environments, but not one that would keep me particularly excited or become a staple in my own life.   I think the Instagram feels a bit confused, with a big chunk of posts that feel very commercial and heavily branded, and others which are much more casual. It's like it's trying to do too much and the values/messaging isn't really clear.   Promoting healthy family lifestyles. ",Harvest,
356712,Olivia,Hayes,olivia.hayes@uon.edu.au,"A sociable person who loves going on adventures and spending quality time with her nearest and dearest; loves to cook and often volunteers to cook for friends and gets stressed out when she plans too many dishes; A high acheiver, who likes to put 100% into everything, especially her work and study.  These are some of my favourite cookbooks just now. The bottom three i rotate through and pick a dish from to make each weekend. The red one on top is a fill-it-yourself recipe book and is filled with some family gems which I love to cook. My mum is on the other side of the world so I often ask her for recipes from my childhood which I add in, it helps me connect with her and feel a bit closer to home.   This is my meditation cushion, in my favourite meditation spot. I sit here every morning for at least 10 minutes to meditate. I love gazing at the growing monstera or out the window on sunny days. It is my one non-negotiable and I meditate every single day. It helps keep me calm and balanced. 
   This is my Alessi whisting kettle which I was given by my brother-in-law at Christmas. It is one of the best presents I have ever received and it brings me joy every day! I love the 'old school' feeling of boiling a kettle and it is a perfect reminder to slow down and enjoy the process. Since working from home it has been a great in getting me away from my desk and bringing me back to the moment. The present was chosen entirely by my brother-in-law and it made me feel special in that he knew me well enough to know I would love this present, which I do!  Fishbox! I think the Fishbox company are fantastic and I am really impressed with everything they do. Fishbox are a company who buy from small fisherman in Scotland and who send fish by delivery on a regular basis. Their tagline is 'boat to plate in 48 hours' and I love that the fish comes with the name of the fisherman and location it was caught giving it a sense that it can be easily traced. They also buy and distribute the by-catch and I've received some fish which I wouldn't have given a second look at, or perhaps wouldn't normally be available in a shop! 
I love their commitment to the local Scottish community, and sustainable fishing. Their customer service team is also fantastic and I love that the fish we receive from them is so fresh, there is a noticeable difference in the taste of their fish! The convenience is also a huge factor for me, during normal times it is difficult to get to a fishmonger so receiving the fish to my door has been a big winner for me, as I prefer not to buy seafood from the supermarket. 
Their product is on the pricier side, but for me it is worth the extra cost!


I also quite like the Plenish drinks range, especially their plant-based milks! The main thing which attracts me to them is their simple ingredients list, they don't add random additives, preservatives, etc. They seem to be focussed on keeping it simple, which I really like. I like the thought of eating plain and simple food, so this is the brand's main attraction for me! Natural - I like to eat a colourful diet filled with as much natural food as possible! I generally feel better and healthier when I eat natural foods, and my skin seems to be happier when I do so too! I like to focus on whole foods, which are either unprocessed or minimally processed (e.g. Plenish plant milks), and use fresh, local and produce which is in season where I can. I try to make sure I have a healthy balance of animal and plant-based products and like to eat and cook with a variety of foods. I love experimenting with unfamiliar products and seeing how I can incorporate these into my diet!

Mindful - In the past I have allowed myself to be overwhelmed by high levels of stress which have wreaked havoc with my body. I have found that by dedicating time for my mental health through meditation and mindfulness I have been better able to control my stress levels and live a more balanced life. I meditate daily, and try to also find ways to incorporate mindfulness into my day, whether that be going for a walk, boiling the kettle or washing the dishes! It has helped give me a much better perspective on what is important and helps to block out the noise of a busy-life!

Physical - My perspective of physical activity has shifted over time and I have realised the importance of incorporating some movement into every day. I used to always think that being active required a hard-core sweat session, however I have realised the importance of gentle activity as well, and incorporating any movement into my day. I try to make sure I always have time for some movement and try to get outside daily. When I don't, I notice a huge difference in my mental state and find I fixate on less important tasks. Some time moving and breathing helps me to let go of this! Taste! I'll give any food or product a chance at least once but if it doesn't taste good, I'm unlikely to purchase or eat it again!

Natural! I try to fill my plate with natural ingredients and/or products with a short ingredients list filled with recognisable ingredients. I like to be able to trace my food and understand what products have gone into making it. I also like the thought that I could re-produce something in my own kitchen, especially if I think I could make it better! 

Gut-friendly & skin friendly - I have had lots of gut and skin issues over the years and have been trying to make more conscious choices which are gut-friendly, and in turn, skin-friendly. This is especially so when choosing dairy or plant-based dairy alternatives. I try to incorporate some fermented foods into my diet every day and find that doing this with dairy/dairy alternatives is the easiest way to do this!

Sustainable- I'd like to think that I make sustainable choices, especially when it comes to purchasing fresh produce. I try to buy what is in season and has been produced in the UK to try and limit my carbon footprint. I also try to avoid plastics where I can. 

Cost - I would love to always be able to choose the organic, locally produced, sustainable products, but in reality this is not always in my budget. I try to be as conscious as I can with my choices though ultimately it also needs to be sustainable for me, so cost does come into play - especially towards the end of the month!  Gut-friendly & skin friendly. I chose this Kefir Natural Yoghurt from The Collective. I have enjoyed trying different kefirs and this is one of my favourites. I love that it is a thicker yogurt rather than a drink and I like the taste which makes it a big win by comparison to other brands I've tried. I can incorporate a spoonful of this into most meals. The product is produced using British milk and in the UK so it gets extra points for being locally produced!   Sustainable! The Plenish drinks range appealed to me for a number of reasons, one of which is their commitment to sustainability. I love that they are carbon neutral and have undertaken additional analysis and research to make sure that they offset their emissions from farm to shelf. The product is pricier than others out there, but this is one which I think gives good reason, plus the product tastes great and much better than others I've tried!   Natural! I chose Dr. Will's Tomato Ketchup when I was out shopping last weekend. The ingredients list appealed to me and I liked that I could pronounce or buy all of the ingredients myself. I like that it is produced in the UK, though there is no mention of sustainably sourcing products. The taste is OK, I probably wouldn't purchase this again on account of the taste, however I do like that it comes in a glass bottle which I'll reuse to try making my own (tastier) version! 
  The biggest challenges are probably: 
1. Cost! The cheaper brands tend to be those which are mass produced and which are cheaper as a result of that! I tend to find this especially true in the dairy/dairy alternatives space where some cheap greek yogurts are £1-2 whereas a kefir or plant based product may be upwards of £3. 

2. Accessibility! Whilst I would love to be able to shop at small independent grocers all the time, that is simply not practical for my lifestyle. I do find it easier and more cost effective to do a big shop once a week and I would tend to go to a larger supermarket for that purpose. If the products I want are not stocked in that supermarket, then I will generally choose the best alternative I can. I try and get to my local Real Foods once or twice a month and stock up on the more hard-to-get items. 

3. Product sizes! I shop for two adults, one of who is very active and eats a lot! We need to buy larger volumes of food to get through the week. The product/packaging sizes tend to be on the smaller size and I need to buy multiple of a product to get the amount we would need in a week. This adds to the cost and is quite frustrating. For example, a Plenish milk comes in 1 litre bottles at £2.50 each. By comparison, the 2.2 litre cows milk at Tesco is £1.09. 
Yoghurt and Kefir is another example of where this is frustrating, most products are 300-450g each, and I need to buy numerous to get to the 1.5kg average we eat in our household each week.  I found this category quite tricky! I chose The Collaborative Kefir Coconut cultured drink as I found this was one of very few healthy convenience items I found in my supermarket! Most items were either not convenience (i.e. appeared to be intended for consumption at home), or filled with sugar (including this one!) which made it tricky to choose one which I really thought to be healthy. The reason I settled on this one was because I associate kefir with health and a healthy gut, both of which are important to me. I liked that this was a thicker drink, so would be more filling and thought of it as an appropriate choice when out and about and looking for a convenient and healthy alternative to most products. 
 I've tried this brand's kefir yogurt which I really enjoyed so I liked the idea of trying this coconut flavoured drink! I really like the packaging that The Collective use, and it is a recognisable branch which I know I'd enjoyed products from previously. I like that it is produced in the UK using British milk though I didn't like all the extra ingredients which were listed (e.g apple & grape juices), which made me grapple with the health side of things. I like the added information about fermation and cultured kefir benefits, and the graphics/colour scheme they use appeals to me. On the whole, I found the healthy convenience section to really be lacking in the biggest Sainsbury's supermarket near to my house!
   I chose Yester Farm Dairies Natural Cottage Cheese. I chose this because I love cottage cheese but have found the supermarket brand cottage cheeses are not to my taste. I've never seen this brand in the supermarket before and so this one caught my eye and I cannot wait to try it! It is produced locally near when I live in Scotland, and is a full fat product so is sure to bring me extra joy! I liked the relatively small ingredient list and that it was packaged in a more exciting container than the bland supermarket alternatives. I like that this hasn't got added flavourings, and I'm going in with the impression that the product tastes great without added flavours to mask  a sub-par product. 
I cannot wait to try this one!
   I chose The Coconut Collaborative Vanilla Custard for this category. I found it was the only plant-based brand which was offering a ready made custard, which really appealed to me. I would usually buy a dairy custard and I think of custard as being an indulgent item so I am intrigued by a plant-based alternative. I'd love to see this in more flavours, like a chocolate custard version! 
 I've had The Coconut Collaborative yogurts and I really enjoyed these so familiarity withe their product definitely helped. The packaging is cool and added to the appeal. I liked that it was in a clear container so I could see the custard. The custard is purported as being lower sugar than other plant-based custards, though I didn't have a point of reference to verify this against. Again the ingredients list is longer than I'd like, but for a treat-product that is to be expected! 
   This was the first product I found and this is the one I am most excited to try! I've never seen this brand before and am really curious to try it. I chose Rora Dairy Scottish Raspberry live yogurt. Everything about this one appealed to me, from the packaging right through to the ingredients list. There were three different flavours in the supermarket but the raspberry appealed to me the most.
 I love that the yogurt is produced in Scotland using cows and raspberries raised and grown in Scotland! I loved the fun packaging and thought the cow on the front was really cute and loved the little snippets of info on the inside of the cardboard as well. I liked that the packaging is clear so I can see the colour and there looks to be loads of bits of raspberry in the yogurt! The ingredients list was short and all things i recognised, i loved that the raspberries were grown in Scotland. 
 I'm pretty excited to get this one home and give it a try!
   1. Innocent juices. I tend to buy juices once or twice a month and love the Innocent range. I love their fun and funky packaging and that they use natural produce in their juices.  The flavours are always fun and interesting and I love that they constantly seem to be bringing out new flavours and combinations! They also taste great and are one of the few that I really genuinely enjoy or trust buying from. 

2. Naked smoothies. I like Naked smoothies and they're really tasty. I don't think I regard them quite as highly as I do the Innocent range, but I do enjoy their products and would happily buy their product if they were the cheaper option on the day. I love their green smoothie and it is by far my favourite of the green smoothies out there. I like that they use real fruits and vegetables in their smoothies, though I tend to find their ingredients list a bit longer so it wouldn't always be my first choice. 
 3. Shaken Udder milk drinks. These are a total guilty pleasure and I don't have these often, but sometimes if I am really craving a milk drink I'll buy a Shaken Udder drink. I like the flavour range they have and it is like no other milk drinks range on the market that I have found. I tend to find other shakes have standard flavours and have an artificial taste, whereas the Shaken Udder shakes actually taste like the flavour they're marketed to be. The packaging is eye catching and funky, and I like that there are also plant based options for those days when I fancy a plant-based alternative.  
   1. Dried fruits - apricots and figs. I tend to get the Tesco brand and I simply choose it as it is the most cost effective when compared with other brands. I like that I can get the soft dried fruits which make them more palatable and I enjoy the texture of the soft apricots and figs. I haven't noticed any brand-name alternatives to these two specific fruits on the shelves before so I suspect they either don't have any in the fruits I like, or they are just too expensive for me. I tend to keep these portions small as they are quite calorie dense!  2. I also love to get the Urban Fruits dried fruits, the fruits they have in their range are different to any other and they are so tasty. I absolutely love the dried coconut chips, dried mango and dried pineapple. Initially their packaging is what drew me to the range, however after trying their products I was sold! I like that their products are packaged in small portions (around 100 calorie portions), though they are on the more expensive side so I tend to buy these as a snack or treat when I'm out and about. 
 3. Rice cakes and cheese. I love to have rice cakes and cheese as a snack, especially after work. I choose the Tesco unsalted rice cakes and would usually have either some cream cheese like Philadelphia or a hard cheddar like Cathedral City. I like to get full fat cheese and keep my portions small. I simply like the taste of both Philadelphia and Cathedral City and would choose the unsalted rice cakes as it is a healthier choice. 
I would normally prefer to have cottage cheese, but I don't like many of the supermarket own brands, so am eager to try the new Yester Dairies product I found to see what it is like!
  
 
   Natural, cool, healthy   Gluten, off-limits, oats.   Mass-produced, disconnected, everywhere   I like that they have gluten free oats and products which i spotted on their instagram. I'd be really keen to see more gluten-free oat based dairy alternatives in the UK! 
I like that it seemed to be targeted at people of all ages and showing that healthy habits are formed from an early age, this also seems to be supported on their Instagram where they have a pregnant woman regularly advertising their products!
   For me, the video was the most compelling piece of advertising for this brand. The first image shown when the brand was revealed didn't work for me and didn't really grab me to try their products. I like the video and the healthy recipes on their instagram page. Demonstrating ways that the products can be used in other ways, e.g. not at breakfast, would be a draw for me!
   I'd probably like to see a more exciting packaging. I don't see how this would stand out against other big companies packaging and I think i'd like to see something different about it, perhaps playing on the Finnish roots. I tend to prefer things which are locally produced and which use local products, my assumption is that this brand would be using Finnish products and produced in Finalnd so that isn't a huge plus for me either. Particularly being located in Scotland, we have a big oat industry here so I think company would need to give someone a good reason to choose their brand over any other in the supermarket, and packaging is one way to go about that, the use of local products would also add to that!
   A healthy, balanced life. A lot of the images shown are related to either healthy eating or physical activity as well as time with family. The brand seems to indicate that healthy eating starts from a very young age, and is pushing that point with the pregnant woman, young children and families. It looks like the brand is targeting families and particularly young families. 
 ",Harvest,
434825,Nadia,Caceres,nadia6caceres@gmail.com,"The funny, somewhat quirky, mother figure of the group.  This is a baby blanket I’ve almost finished knitting for a friend’s first baby. I think it reflects who I am because 1) I knit a lot and  2) I’m not really someone who likes ‘stuff’. I think the best gifts are the ones that someone has made/that are more personal than what you buy in a shop.   It is still in the early stages (and a terrible photo) but my veggie patch and garden in general is important to my health and wellbeing. On workdays I don’t get to go outside, so on days off or in the evenings doing a bit of gardening allows me to get some fresh (for London) air and be a bit active. The veggie patch is my favourite as I can grow organic veggies and eat them at their freshest.   This little monster, Lola, brings me joy everyday. She’s a relatively new addition to the family and I’ve wanted a cat for ages. She has such a personality and we have good chats daily!  A brand that comes to mind when thinking about something that really reflects my values is Beco soap. It is a vegan, eco-friendly, organic biodegradable and sustainable product. It comes in cardboard with no plastic so the packaging is recyclable AND the company specifically employs people who are visually impaired or are otherwise considered disabled or disadvantaged and who would perhaps find it more difficult to find a job. They describe their products as ‘socially enterprising’. 

The reason I’ve chosen them as a brand that really gets me is because that whenever I look for a new product (commonly toiletries, but ultimately anything from cleaning products to clothes to food) I try to make ‘good choices’. I try to find products that are natural and that have minimal negative impact on the environment. Often when I find something that I initially think sounds good, I do a little digging and though it has ticked one box it falls short of another box. So for example a natural cleaning product that comes in a spray bottle that cannot be recycled or an organic snack that has crazy air miles.

Beco has not only found a way to tick the eco boxes but it has gone one further and thought of another way it can do good. And I forgot to mention the soaps smell AMAZING. Basically it does everything I want a product to do. For Christmas I bought loads as little stocking fillers for friends and family. Stress-free/calm - As a perfectionist and an overthinker, stress is one of the things that most commonly threatens my happiness and my well-being. I utilise a lot of my brain space and energy on a daily (and nightly) basis analysing every situation and every decision. A great part of this, I am aware, is about me and how I am wired but many external factor contribute also. My job is incredibly stressful, society as a whole is experiencing so much stress and the planet is too. 

Stress is psychological and physical. The stress hormones our bodies produce can affect brain development in babies, can make you gain weight and affect your skin and your hair. A life with less stress would certainly be a happier and healthier one!

Variety/varied - Variety is important for health and happiness to me because it reduces the risk of boredom and reduces the need for a small number of things to fulfil all criteria. For example in terms of diet, there is no one fruit and veg that has all the nutrients you need, no matter how many of them you eat. But if you eat multiple different ones, you’re more likely to tick all the vitamin boxes. Equally, if you do the same activities every day and see the same things or the same people everyday that is also not as fulfilling. That’s not to say I want every day to be full of only new things - that would not align with my ‘stress-free’ mantra as I’d never be familiar or comfortable with anything - but regular small changes can make life more fun and more engaging. Trying a new vegetable at the supermarket, going for a walk in a different park to usual, finding an activity to do in the evening that isn’t watching TV (most recently a mosaic of a clownfish). These types of things increase the chances of a more healthy and happy life. 

Natural/nature - living in ‘modern society’ as we do, and living somewhere like London which is so full of concrete and cars, I think it’s easy to forget that we are in fact a creation of nature. A creation that  has come about through many many rounds of trial and error. We have been designed to be our best selves when taking advantage of what nature has to offer and when challenged by nature’s dangers. We have created a world where we have much less respect and appreciation for nature than we should and I think that a life in which we remember its value is a better one. By this I mean everything from breathing air not filled with pollution and eating food/using products whose ingredients you could identify, to listening to the sound of birds or the ocean and feeing grass between your toes.

E.g I would rather eat something sweetened with cane sugar than with sweetener any day. The exception to this concept for me is that I don’t eat meat but I do eat meat substitutes. And this is not necessarily about physical health but moral health. The ingredient in chicken is (hopefully) just chicken but in Quorn is a dozen things, not all of which are natural and sometimes this bothers me. But I feel it is an exception worth making both for the reduced environmental impact of not eating meat and the reduces demand for the meat industry with all its horrid conditions. 1) Food and drink should be either good for the body or good for the soul. If it’s not, then you shouldn’t eat it! What I mean by this is that it is important to drink plenty of water, eat whole grains and lean protein and fruit/veggies but I think it’s also important to have the slice of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and a cup of Earl grey tea. And to really enjoy it, free of guilt. Being about to derive joy from something as essential as food and drink is a great thing and as long as overall you are sensible, you can keep your body healthy AND have a French martini!

2) Ease/convenience - though I’m not particularly happy about it, ease plays a significant role in what I eat and drink. My partner and I cook regularly and I actually really enjoy cooking but I’m often too tired and hungry by the time I get home from work to cook anything that takes too long. So I will often sacrifice complete control over ingredients for speed e.g. spice mixes/pastes for curries, packets of pre-cooked lentils. 

3) Ingredients - having said that, I do try to choose things that are free from artificial ingredients where I have the option (and the price point isn’t crazy). 

4) Environmental impact - though I don’t categorically only eat organic and local, it is something I regularly consider when picking my food. I will try to pick fruit and veg that are grown here/near if possible and consider packaging etc when I buy. I’ve started buying dried pulses as you get more for you money and they take up less space in transit etc in terms of carbon footprint. But they need soaking time and much longer cooking time than tinned so I don’t use them all the time. I was buying pasta that came in a cardboard instead of a plastic bag that couldn’t been recycled, but the variety/availability of this is quite limited where I usually shop.  Ingredients 
Firstly these are delicious, tastier than your average crisps. But more than this, they are simple in their ingredients, deriving their tastiness from them directly. The ingredients are all natural, can be counted on the fingers of 1 hand and they are more nutritious than normal crisps. 

 As an aside, I also like their packaging. It is a cardboard box so it stands out from all the other packets on the shelf (though sadly still has a plastic bag inside) and I find the name  entertaining.   Ease 
This is fairly self explanatory. Not only are the lentils cooked but they are already seasoned and sauced. So they can literally be rated straight from the packet or incorporated into a recipe with minimal faff. This particular brand I like because it had a great variety of products - grains and pulses - and they’re just very tasty. Some other brands, such as Jamie Oliver, make similar things but I’ve not really liked the flavours.   Environmental impact - as I mentioned in the previous questions and in contradiction to the principle above, here are some of my dried pulses. Here it is about product, not brand. From one packet of dried lentils you get as much as 4-5 tins, so it takes up less space being stored/transported by distributors but also at home, which is useful in London’s tight spaces and great in a lockdown when there is fear of apocalypse (half joking). They are also more economical as you’re not paying for the tins or to store and transport water. You can buy them without any packaging in shops that let you bring your own tubs but I have none near me and they are significantly more expensive. So it’s not perfect as they still come in plastic but it’s a good start I think.  I’ve actually mentioned many of these already. 

1) Price - the more natural food and those with leas negative environmental impact are invariably more expensive

2) Packaging - even foods that are healthy and natural often come in packaging that isn’t recyclable. The netting around satsumas CAN be made out of plastic that can be recycled with plastic bags but it rarely is. And if you want loose fruit and veg you then have to sacrifice variety. For example you can get one type of loose tomato vs 10 types in packaging. 

3) Convenience vs making from scratch - I much prefer the idea of making food from scratch but with my current lifestyle it just isn’t feasible. Though I find it frustrating to buy pre-made things, especially for lunch while at work, it means I free up time and energy and it allows me to eat more of a variety of things as I’m not limited by what I can realistically not waste in a week. So I could buy a salad for lunch that has 10 ingredients and not have to worry that some of those ingredients would go to waste. Whereas if I made the same salad at home, using a tenth of a butternut squash or of a pomegranate, I would then need to make 10 portions to use up all the ingredients or use the same things in multiple meals which isn’t necessarily bad but limited the variety.  Disclaimer: I walked down the three aisles that contain the related products today and felt generally uninspired. I have selected something for each questions but this includes 2 for 2 of the questions because one just wasn't enough to fully answer the questions! So here goes. 
 So the convenience aspect is simply because the yogurts come in portion sizes as opposed to a big tub. This is useful because it means I can take them to work easily. There is never as good a variety of single portion yogurts for adults as there are big tubs, which I feel is a shame, though I do buy big tubs more often than small ones. I think they are healthy in so far as they are organic, they have live cultures which are great for the gut and they are sweetened with honey which is a natural ingredient instead of sweeteners like many of the 'healthy' yogurt options. I much prefer simple flavoured yogurts or those which are plain with a compote layer as opposed to an all in one. I've not tried this flavour before, so can't comment on it specifically but I do like Yeo Valley as a brand. To me they represent good quality, as I've enjoyed the products I have tried thus far and I like that buying their products gives you points. I know it is a marketing ploy but I have used those points to get discounts on other products that interest me such as Neal's Yard and Thompson and Morgan horticultural website, so even though their products are a little pricier than other similar products, I have made the difference back and more.
   So I've chose two because I feel that either really catches my eye as such but both bring joy. The eye catching bit is perhaps because I am very familiar with both products and I have treated myself to them many times so they no longer register that dramatically when I see them but they are always a pleasure to consume! 
 1) This cheese, like many of the TTD cheeses, is a joy to eat and at Sainsbury's where I most frequently shop, the variety of cheese they have in this range is not matched by other brands. There are multiple mozzarellas, dozens or cheddars but of the less common world cheeses there is only the Taste the Difference range and they are delicious. This one, made from sheep's milk, is sweet and had a great texture that is at the softer end of the hard cheese, similar to a Manchego. It is my pick if we're going for a 'fun' cheese, whereas my partner's is a Tallegio, also from TTD. As a brand in general, I have had many products, dairy and beyond and I think they are yummy while being unpretentious. Their packaging/branding is simple and unfussy, and I do like the little drawing of the sheep scene too. 
 
 
 2)This is joy in a different way. I drink this almost exclusively hot, like an instant hot chocolate. It is less heavy than a dairy version but still as sweet, chocolatey and comforting, and copes well with being steamed. Oatly as a brand I also really enjoy, I regularly drink their barista oat milk too and I think they are really funny. I think they have found a way to make fun of themselves and of the concept of marketing that is very effective. They have mastered the informal style of communication that I first remember from Innocent smoothies and they say and do everything they need to on their cartons without coming across stuffy or boring. Great stuff.
   To be honest, there were not that many non-dairy products that looked that appealing. I think they do exist but perhaps there were just not that many at the supermarket today. I chose this plant-based yogurt from The Collective. It caught my eye because of the bright coloured label and the different shape compared to the traditional taller, narrower tubs. It was easy to spot that it was a dairy alternative, as the PLANT bit has been written bigger than what the product is or its flavour. I chose it over others of the same brand because I'm a fan of a layered yogurt, I don't like every mouthful to taste exactly the same. I also found it interesting that it is made from a variety of alternatives. Not all coconut or all oat but a blend, which I would be curious to try.
   Again here I have chosen two. This is because the Tom Parker brand appeals to me more than the Coconut Collaborative but if I actually had to pick one to buy it would be the custard because the iced coffee has sugar in it and I do not like sugar in my coffee, especially when it is ~90% milk which is sweet enough (and they don't do a version without sugar). 1) I'm curious to try it for 2 main reasons. I love custard and I have never tried a dairy free custard/pudding before. Though the branding isn't particularly slick or exciting, the simplicity of it implies that it is based in natural products which appeals to me. I think if it were very brightly coloured it would stand out more but it wouldn't necessarily make me more likely to buy it. I also like the name of the brand. Collaborative implies togetherness and harmony and lots of other positive words, though I have no idea why they're called that. Perhaps they have a mission beyond just making food products or maybe they just thought it would make more people buy it! 
 2) I like many things about the look of this product. Interestingly the name is the opposite of the one above, it is the name of a single man vs a 'collaborative'. This implies it is small scale and grass roots, and again quite a natural product...which it is. It is literally milk, coffee and raw cane sugar. I like that it comes in a glass bottle, nicer to drink from and easily recyclable. You can also see what the drink actually looks like which is nice too. And I like the cute cartoon cow with the country scene within it, very sweet. It is my dream to one day find a bottled cold coffee I actually like, this is yet to happen.
   1) Tropicana Ruby Breakfast juice - This is one of my favourites. The grapefruit reduces the sweetness of the orange and its a refreshing and tangy drink. It is not that common and this is the brand that I most frequently find. It's not from concentrate, has great juicy bits and is generally not too pricey.
 
2) Innocent smoothies/juices - More often the juices because I like them better as they are a bit lighter. In all honestly when we want a juice, we tend to go for whichever interesting flavour is on offer, because fun juices are often quite expensive and we don't drink it that often. We basically always have a juice in the fridge but it takes a good while to drink it. I name Innocent as they are the brand we have most often purchased but not exclusively. They continue to come up with new flavour combinations which is great. The lastest one I tried is one with guava and it really tastes like guava, would recommend.
   I am not a big snacker, so apart from fresh fruit when I do snack it is often on a biscuit and cup of tea which isn't very healthy! But when I do buy healthy snacks...: 1) Yoyo bears - definitely designed for children but 100% fruit and in a snack sized packet. It is the most readily available/ubiquitous of it's kind. I don't know of another brand that does it that is cheaper/better in any other way. 
 2) Nairn oat biscuits - these come in a few different flavours and are all yummy. My favourite is chia and coconut which are actually quite hard to find. Again I like them because they are made with natural ingredients, they have less fat and sugar than a standard biscuits and more fibre from the oats. Nairn makes good quality, simple products. And again they are the only ones that make this particular flavoured product as far as I am aware. My only complaint is that they come in packs of ~5 biscuits which are more than I want in one sitting and they become stale before I can eat the rest!
   Smoothie, juice, fun.
   Milk, barista, yummy.
   Almond, old, soya.   Overall I was fairly neutral about the brand so there were not that many things I actively liked. 
 I saw they posted about food waste and I like that they are using their platform to promote something other than their product. And food waste is a cause that I care about. 
   I wouldn’t say the brand was compelling at all really. I don’t think I’d buy it. Not sure what it offers me that something like Quaker doesn’t and I know exactly what I’m getting with Quaker and other already familiar brands.   I think the branding as a whole looks quite dated. Some of the food actually looks quite unappetising, with the oats looking dry and claggy. The product placement seems very unnatural and forced, it doesn’t look like a real scene in which the products happen to be. 

 Also everyone in the posts is Caucasian, there is some age diversity but no ethnic diversity at all. 

 A lot of the scenes that are in nature are in snow, which though nice, and a logical contrast to the warm porridge, neither appeals nor relates to my life at all.   Not really sure. I think it looks like a product for all the family, simple, unpretentious, healthy, nothing novel or exciting, more a traditional vibe. ",Harvest,INFJ
300180,Daria,Wilcocks,dariawilcocks@gmail.com,"Down-to-earth, creative soul who is finding her way in the world as a first-time-mum.  I've chosen my Roberts radio for a couple of reasons. Namely, because it plays my favourite music, podcasts and radio shows which reflects my love of the arts and good conversation. I'm sorely missing live music since giving birth (oh and the tiny problem via a pandemic) so I've been making more of a daily habit of having the radio on in the background playing my favourite music whilst cooking, cleaning etc. Because I've worked my way up through art college, uni and into a creative career, I also chose this item as it is now an iconic design reinvented that satisfies my need to be surrounded by beautiful objects! I may not have the money to buy expensive art or spend thousands on interiors, but little well-designed things in my home like this make me happy.   I chose my yoga mat for this one (even though it's a downloaded image because the real life one is stuck in the back of my mums car currently...), which is pretty obvious but is the one thing that encompasses the things I need for my health and wellbeing. I've been berating myself recently for not picking up yoga since giving birth, my muscles and bones seem to permanently be sore or ache which I know is partly my body recovering but I also know that doing some light yoga would be really beneficial and give me some headspace for myself to feel like the 'old me' a bit more. Now that things are slowly re-opening, I've vowed to carve some time out to go to a yoga class on my own for a bit of a break from parenting and to start to feel stronger and healthier. It's a cliche, but I've never walked out of a yoga class worse off mentally than when I went in. It's good for the soul and a practice that I think is needed more than ever as we learn to navigate this post-covid world.   This is my son's giraffe teether made from natural rubber. It's a popular teether that most parents seem to have nowadays so there's nothing especially unique about it, but it brings me such joy because of how simply satisfying it is for him. Now that he's got good hand/eye control, he loves trying to give it a good chew and when he does it makes a funny little squeaking sound against his gums that makes me laugh. It's also funny watching him play with it in the pushchair - sometimes if he's feeling a bit annoyed or frustrated he'll grip it in his hands and stare at it and have a conversation with it, I imagine him telling it off and it always makes me smile seeing this innocent interaction through his eyes.  A couple of brands that have recently really resonated with me:

- Tonys Chocoloney: This speaks to me on a few levels. It's brilliant design and recognisable branding that makes you feel like you're buying chocolate from Willy Wonka himself. The anti-slavery ethos which also educates you on the cocoa industry as a whole and makes me think about my purchasing power. The unique way the chocolate doesn't break into equal pieces to further tell that story. The exciting flavour combinations that keep me coming back for more and satisfy my 'foodie' side.

- Veja trainers: Again, this speaks to me on a few levels as a brand similar to Tony's Chocoloney. I love their styling and the minimalistic, good design of the shoes that go with most outfits. The sustainable approach is really important to me as I'm making more of an effort to buy less and buy more consciously. The way that Veja has blended both good design, sustainability, and a feeling of luxury I think is really clever, especially as the price range isn't astronomical so an everyday person like me can buy into them. Curiosity - I think being curious is a really valuable personality trait in life in general. The more curious you are about all aspects of life, the more you'll reap the rewards. You never stop learning and experiencing if you're curious and you will undoubtedly become a healthier, happier person because of it.

Food - I've always been brought up with a rich variety in my diet, both healthy and treat foods, nothing has been disallowed or frowned upon which I think has made me more open to new flavours and cuisines over the years. I really believe enjoying food to be an important part of the family and a social tradition to eat together really helps keep us all healthy and happy. I also think that the more you embrace food, learning about it, experimenting and enjoying it, the more you will naturally lean towards healthier options and aim to have a balanced diet overall.

Travel - Having spent most of my 20s travelling or living in different parts of the world, travel is really important to my health and happiness overall. I hope that one day I'll be able to show a lot more of the world to my son and have him appreciate all the incredible cultures and scenery out there! 1/ How much time I have: Becoming a new parent, I never knew how hard it would be for me to eat a full meal in peace. I am never one to skip meals so I try and work out meal and snack options that are easy to throw together, without compromising on flavour.
2/ Variety: This is within a week, a day and even on one plate. I can't stand bland, repetitive meals (although I obviously have my favourite 'go-tos) and try to incorporate all sorts of flavours, cuisines and treats into my family life
3/ Vegetarian: I was going to say sustainable, but I think that's incredibly hard to analyse or maintain so instead I'm saying vegetarian as I have been actively trying to reduce my meat consumption for the past few years. I'm also trying to think seasonally in terms of the veggies/fruits I pick and more eco-friendly, so for instance I only drink oat milk in my cereal now. One thing that I find really important when making veggie meals is to incorporate as many different herbs, spices as possible and another thing I think really helps is having a good selection of condiments on hand!  (Time Saving) Ramen Noodles - unknown brand. I think these prove how I like to find things that are easy to make but still excite the tastebuds and draw from flavours around the world. I unknowingly bought this pack in the world food aisle of the supermarket, thinking that they just contained the noodles, but it's actually three packs of noodles with sauce and seasoning to make a complete, quick meal. These are perfect for my and my boyfriend as I can use them to make a full Katsu curry ramen dish quickly and he can have them as a nice lunch option during the work week.   (Variety) Bramble Muesli - Co Op. I was attracted to buying this luxury muesli on a whim last week, mainly down to the name and the way it conjurs up imagery for me that I'll be eating a super fruity and juicy mix of fruit for breakfast reminiscent of an English hedgerow! I love nuts too, but it's not often you see pistachios in muesli mixes, so that makes it even more luxurious. I really like the product imagery, it definitely gives you the impression of a full and satisfying cereal choice rather than the dust you seem to get in other muesli packets...   Siracha chilli sauce - Thai Dragon brand. You could argue this is the OG of chilli sauce now that millennials have adopted it as their go-to for avocado and eggs on toast, pho and spring roll goodness. I'm definitely one of those people that fell for the trend and now this sauce is a staple in my cupboard. I love having it with pizza crusts, sometimes mixed with a bit of mayo. It goes with any kind of eggs, avocados, on the side of warm salads, all sorts! I definitely think it's a good sauce to have on hand to make a veggie dish exciting, the flavour has a good kick without being overwhelming. The Flying Goose branding is also really recognisable now, so dupes like this feel really similar and even if you don't focus on the words and imagery on the bottle, the bright red and green cap stands out from the rest.  For both my boyfriend and me, having a sweet tooth really affects our diet on a weekly basis and means that most days we have to either have chocolate or a sweet dessert in the evening. No matter how healthy we have been with our main meals, we usually cancel this out by eating too much sugar. Also, being new parents, we have been especially tired for the past few months and with lockdown creating a sense of boredom, most weeks we will get takeaways. It seems like a novel little treat when you can't go out and experience restaurants, plus the endless washing up nowadays feels really frustrating, but it's obviously not great for our wellbeing overall!  I already love drinking kefir yoghurt drinks, coming from an Eastern European background it's been a 'thing' growing up before it became trendy. However, this new product by Biotiful really caught my eye. The branding is simple and bold, you can easily read what you're getting and the typeface helps you to recognise the brand from the drink version easily. The combination of cherry and tea I thought was quite unusual and knowing I could get the benefits of kefir in shot form in the mornings I think is a great idea, because it's not every day that I fancy having the full kefir drink. I'd be keen to give these a go especially now that I'm sleep deprived and need to keep my immune system in good check while I look after a baby!   Cocio get it so right for me in terms of their branding. This chocolate milk is not only the most creamy and tasty in my opinion, but being in a glass bottle and wrapped up in such a pretty, 50s style label just screams sophistication and the 'dolce vita' to me. It almost makes you savour the flavour more than a plastic bottled milk and I think having such a pared back, minimal styling it kind of gives you the impression that these guys know what they're doing and don't need to try and con you into thinking their product is good with busy labels or too many graphics. At the end of the day, the product speaks for itself and gives me a lot of joy drinking it!   This flavoured greek yoghurt version of a coconut yoghurt really appealed to me, basically because it looks exactly like a dairy version would and I can imagine the flavour being really indulgent and tasty. The brand Oykos I already know and like from their greek yoghurts, so I think they would be the best brand to branch out into non-dairy because they understand the type of texture and flavour needed to convince someone that this coconut yoghurt was just as good as their normal products. The Straciatella flavour I think is a brilliant idea, it instantly made me think of holidays and having a treat, so now that I'm trying to cut back on so many dairy products in my life, this would fit in easily without feeling like I was missing out.   This Laughing Cow spread has caught my eye recently because it seems like such an odd combination, but one that also now seems pretty logical if you're wanting to cut down on dairy consumption! I absolutely love both hummus (or chickpeas generally) and cheese spreads, so both of these combined with herbs could be a really great alternative to just cheese on its own. I think having the thick and creamy textures together blended with herbs would be really satisfying and coming from a brand I already know and love makes me more curious to try it. It also makes me trust that they would get this new flavour right compared to a completely new brand.   Morrisons 100% Smooth Orange fruit juice - We used to get Tropicana a lot when it was on offer, but over time have realised that as a weekly shopping staple, our supermarket's own brand is just as good and will save us money overall. It's got a great tangy flavour, doesn't seem watery or poor quality and as a small bonus point, the bottle fits really well in our fridge door, compared to bulky Tropicana boxes! 
 We don't buy smoothies a lot, but if we do, we like the Innocent range. The branding is great because it's built its reputation over the years as being fun, charitable and tempting with a number of delicious flavour combinations. I also like how they've started to focus more on overall wellbeing by adding things like ginger and flaxseeds to the mixes which can be masked by the strong fruit flavours or complement them, depending on how much you like those additions. Innocent are great because they're not full of sugar like other smoothie brands and have a thicker, more satisfying texture.   Gosh falafel - These have been on regular rotation in my shopping basket for a couple of years now. I think the branding is really fresh and modern and the products themselves always taste super fresh and full of flavour too. Gosh! outdo their competitors in terms of the herby, spicy kick to their falafel and how big the actual falafel are too. They never seem too dry either, so I find them a great veggie snack or to have them stuffed in pittas with other veggie delights. If I'm in a hurry and need something to 'put me on' I like having some falafel on hand to quickly eat or dip into something while I'm making up a bigger meal or rushing out of the door. Graze Superfood Oat Bites - These are great to have in my bag when I'm on the go as they're filling enough to last me until my next meal but also feel like a sweet treat, even though they're healthier than a standard chocolate bar. I like that I'm getting some oats into my snacks too as it helps with breast milk supply, as well as keeping me feeling fuller for longer with that indulgent cocoa and orange flavour. The Graze brand I've been a fan of for years when I used to subscribe to their snack boxes when I worked in an office, but I think these oat bites are a more substantial snack that is ideal when you're busy and don't want to make poor food choices. Graze feels like a brand that's 'grown up' in the last few years, and caters to the whole family now, not just people that you imagine are at work or out and about, it's a brand I'm happy to have in my cupboard for the whole family to enjoy.    Fun, charitable, smart.   Millennial, confident, progressive   Standard, healthy, respected   It's got a wholesome, friendly feel that comes across very strongly in the TVC, perhaps not so much in the Instagram. I like that it promotes itself in a healthy, outdoorsy kind of way without being too over the top or restrictive. The last line on the TVC 'feel free to eat' is what I would like to think my own ethos is so that rang true with me.   I think the brand is compelling because there's not another breakfast or whole food brand that I can immediately compare it to as competition. It has strong visuals so would certainly become memorable after I'd seen it in the supermarkets a few times, as I've said before I think the modern twist on retro packaging is really clever and could become quite iconic over time.   It's almost a bit too 'goody two shoes' if that makes sense? A bit too wholesome, like no one's life really is that content and perfect and I think brands are more prepared to be honest and realistic on social media nowadays. I also think that you're going to have a hard time launching something like this in the UK if you don't address how white the audience is represented, it would need to feel a bit more inclusive for me to take it seriously as a brand. I understand it reflects very well a Scandinavian profile, but perhaps this needs adapting slightly for different audiences.   I think it stands for a happy, balanced family lifestyle with lots of outdoor exploration and enjoying food not just as fuel but as a social, bonding experience. It represents healthy food choices that consider unprocessed and natural ingredients. ",Harvest,
397621,Ruth,Elborn,ruth.elborn@gmail.com,"This is Ruth at her best, wild and free, full of heart and integrity....she is finding her way.  This is a ceramic vase i made- it slumped in on itself and became like a bag of flour- I love the process of transformation,I love clay I love baking bread- so something about the simplicity and sturdyness/fragility of this i feel reflects me as a person.   My trainers- running is so so important for my health and wellbeing, to move for free and cover different territory is really important to me.   I LOVE my aeropress...the ritual and the slow process of it- it bring me so much joy everyday when I make my coffee!  A brand that really resnates with me right now is Elsa's natural deoderant. Its refillable, brilliant quality, made in the the UK, organic, recyclable packaging (if not refilling) and it works! I feel like it gets my taste, my desire to be more sustainable, to connect to local produce and its low key. Nourishment- to be nourished- have good inputs- in terms of food but also conversations, things I read etc
Play- to be playful is essential to happiness for me- to find joy in small things, to be able to laugh and not take life too seriously is something I am aiming for
Creativity- to be able to express whats inside- this is key for me to both happiness and health- without creativity there are blocks and stagnancy '-Will it nourish me (ideally organic, nutrient full, wholefoods)
-Will it being me joy
-How much does it  cost to the environment (local/seasonsal)
-How much does it cost me financially'  1. Nourishment- flaxseed supports my energy levels, helps regulate my hormones and ovulation, helps digestion and blood sugar levels and is a great way to get omega 3 as a vegetarian. It is organic and cold-milled which gets the best out of it.    Joy- this product brings me SO MUCH JOY! I would defy anyone to stick their spoon in this and not want to eat the whole jar. ITs also much healthier than sugary treats, so its nourishing and so so yummy.  Food is there to bring joy and smiles and this product 100% does that for me!   Environmental Price- these are locally grown oats, reducing the air miles on my food and connecting to locally made products- plus i love jumbo oats!  '-Plastic!! SO much plastic everywhere- I want to reduce my plastic intake but its so hard sometimes!
-Availability of local products- not always easy to find locally sources things
-Seasonal- lots of fruit isn't available all year round, but its a big sacrifice to only eat seasonally
-Joy- sometimes i'm short on time and need something simple and nourishing'  These little bottles scream to me of convenience- like grab and go breakfast, and the fact that this has immune support and vitamins added and is dairy free makes me think its probably fairly healthy (I think the brown branding plays in to this too)   Because i LOVE yogurt haha! Also i love greek yogurt, and had read that yeo-valley have been kerning yogurt to basically make a UK version of greek yog- so this brings me joy because its local, its organic, its new and fun (i've actually been looking in shops for a while for it so was DELIGHTED to find it at last!) and has a cute message/story on the back. I just generally love yeo-valley products too.   It has a great taste star- which I really rate and would actually make me much more likely to buy a non dairy product. Also I like the colours, the images, the big use of the work 'natural' and 'plant based' in friendly branding, again with a nice explanation on the back of it.   I think all innovations in the milk world are exciting given how amazing oatly/oatmilk has turned out to be- this looks fun, low calorie, high protein- i would be curious to see if it is actually nice!   i. Pure Orange juice (Co-op/waitrose/marks and spencers) with bits in it - i love the classics, some fancy 'freshish' organge juice is one of my favs. Its fresh and feels fairly unadulterated. ii. Copella apple juice- sometimes I buy this to make bircher museli with- i much prefer the cloudy apple over the clear apple juice. Again- its all about taste for me.   i. Yumello- date almond butter- its delicious and innovative and not too processed ii. Popchips- I don't know how actually healthy they are, but I LOVE the salt and vinegar ones- they might be processed but they are a yummy, not-too high calorie/fat content crispy crisp with a great flavour. YUM!   Thick, innovators, fruity   Delicious, inspiring, popular   not as tasty   I like the scandi /icelandic (?) aspect- i think it contextualised it more for me and some of the instagram images fit with the ideas of hygge and 'good living' that are so often associated with scandi life. I  like the clip of the boat on calm water and that intergenerational aspect, I like some of the food styling on their instagram and like the images of the oat fields- makes the brand feel more connected to the process   Not very compelling- it seems to me like a safe product but why is it any different from others? Is it local? Is it organic? Do they pay their workers well? Is it exciting and innovative? These to me are the things that make for a compelling product and its hard to tell how much this product reaches these aspects.   I don't like the blond women holding wheat and that most of the instagram images are of women- it feels very domesticated/patriarchal and some of the images (e.g. women with long lashes and bare shoulders) are almost sexualised- this is a real turn off for me. The image and branding does feel like a nordic version of quaker oats, which don't get me wrong- quaker has its place in the market, but makes it feel like an older brand targeted at an older audience.   I'm really not sure- housewives? (Sorry if this is too honest haha). I think it's maybe trying to go for a female empowerment thing but possibly missing the mark slightly. It feels very nuclear family. I feel like its trying to stand for that wholesome cottage-core lifestyle but again slightly missing the mark on this. ",Harvest,ENFP
295473,Nathaniel,Cole,natty.cole@gmail.com,"Hmmm, my best friend would describe me as gentle. He always calls me a gentle giant.  It sounds silly but I've kept this glass in a box for most of my life? I moved into my own flat with my girlfriend last year and finally took it out of the box and started to use it for certain drinks. I'm someone that holds on to things and waits until the right time to use them    My books. For the first time in my life, I feel engaged by the books I'm reading and I'm reading them at a pace that was impossible for me before because I use a mixture of physical reading, audiobooks and reading from my phone. Reading balances me out. I find so many answers to the questions that I have subconsciously in the books that I read.   I have this photo of my holding my nephew. I get to see him every two weeks and I love him more than life itself. My family grounds me and his smile will always make me feel warm.  It's weird, I'm beginning to grow weary of brands now. When I was in my 20s, I would say that brands need to be personable, empower influencers and communities and amplify their stories. 

Now I think brands need transparency and honesty instead. I appreciate brands like Patagonia, Innocent, Nike for their creative and forward-thinking work but the latter especially lack the transparency that's needed to change the world and make lasting impact. What would it mean for the climate emergency for BA to reduce their annual flights by 40%? For Nike to actually employ all of their workers? When profits are effected for workers rights, I'll be able to get on board with brands. 

In fact, one brand I really love is Print Social (https://www.weareprintsocial.com/) simply because they make a point of donating 5% of all revenue to charities (that you can choose!) and encourage their customers/service users to do. the same. Love (Happy) - We need love to show up for ourselves and other people everyday. I don't want to imagine a world without love.

Movement (Healthy) - I think everyone should be able to explore what movement means for them. It doesn't have to be running or HIIT training but something that allows them to explore their body and heartrate that's different to walking/commuting.

Nourishment (Life) - Food is so important. Over the last year I've obviously had more takeaways than I normally would but there's something about eating good that your body can work with that makes me feel good/nourished? It's like when you stop drinking for a short period and realise how much better your body functions lol. 1 - My weight. I'm trying to lose weight, or as my PT puts it, we're trying to get into my jeans again! I aim to lose 4.5 inches from my waist this year. I've lost one so far! So that's a driver for what I decide to eat each day.

2 - Tomorrow - I know that whatever I choose to eat today, will affect me tomorrow, so I take that into account when eating.

3 - Happiness - Will what I eat make me happy? Will it make me feel good? Will I feel proud of myself?

4 - Enjoyment - As much as the previous 3 things matter, what about what I'm doing in the moment? I went to a couple of pubs last week and had a great time emotionally, even though I drank loads and ate more chips than I care to think about. So it's about the balance of everything, how do I make up for yesterday while being kind to myself at the same time?  Weight - CousCous! I really struggle to find motivation to eat with my weight in mind because I'm not familiar with grains outside of rice but Cous Cous' simplicity really has me hooked and saves me when I've mistimed lunch meal preparation.   Tomorrow - Cumin! If this is going in my meal, then it's probably gonna be a good one and my stomach will thank me lol   Happiness and Enjoyment - Plantain is life for a start and frying some up for a quick snack is one of my favourite go-to's in life. Now...with the rum, that's enjoyment! I love dead man's fingers because of the favours, it's so nice even on its own.  My biggest challenge is consistency/ I had a really solid routine from the start of the year until Mid March (gf's birthday) and that messed with my routine so much that I haven't been able to get back into it for ages now. 

Other than that, boredom, the same routine, while it can have the benefits of me feeling happier for instance, there's an emptiness that comes with repetition that I don't like too.

It's frustrating because it feels like a never ending battle with my body and mind, rather than a harmony between the two. I only had the harmony in 2019 when I was partying, exercising and socialising a lot, all on my terms and I liked how I looked/felt too.  It's dried MANGO, NEED I SAY MORE?! But honestly, this is a life-saver for me because I have a real sweet tooth and the dry mango provides that sweet flavour, while being marginally better for me than chocolate. Own brand options are usually my preference with basic items.   With supermarket Patties, people are really divivded by them, some against and some for, I'm obviously in the 'for' camp as these packets of Lamb, beef, chicken or veg have been sustaining me since I was a kid. I choose them for joy because I know exactly what I'm going to get when I pop them in the microwave/oven. I chose this brand because they're the biggest in the UK Supermarkets, there's not much choice unfortunately.   Have any of the team had these pots before? They're so good! The coconut collaborative (I love their name mostly) do a  great job of making tasty treats with one of my favourite and tummy-safe ingredients. It was a toss up between this and gu pots but the gu ones are bit too expensive for me.   What excites me? The idea that I'll have something new to enjoy that might nourish me in a new way. I'm curious to judge the execution if I'm being absolutely honest.   None make it into my fridge!  
I buy meal deals if I'm on the run and that's only every other Tuesday when I rush off to look after my nephew. On those days, Innocent's new energiser smoothie makes it into my bags. I normally buy Innocent, I think they were the first mainstream smoothies I bought and then seeing the brand journey (getting bought out by coca cola etc.) and their tone of voice has always been fun. I love the hat they put on their smoothie bottles at Christmas.  Again, I have a sweet tooth, and Innocent smoothies give me that sugar high I need  My girlfriend makes 90% of the smoothies at home, we recently bought a NINJA blender as well. We live on a high st and market so we have fairly fresh produce on our doorstep, made sense to get the blender!   Hippea crisps, banana's/oranges, misfits protein bars. 
 The crisps are a health conscious brand, using chickpeas to make wotsit-like crisps, super tasty. I love this brand because of the type of snack it is, they're a lot nicer than the coconut alternative. Fruit is an easy option, as I have access to it for cheap. Misfits are a vegan protein/health company. Their TOV is very in your face but they seem like a company that's been designed with people like m in mind, people that want to be aware of what they're putting in their body and give their bodies the nourishment they need. Misifts have a great website and variety of products, others seem too narrow.   approachable, sweet, kind   the best, elite, authentic   basic, available, off   I like the messaging of family and love and how that intertwines with food.   It's hard for me to see it outside or away from the prism of Quaker Oats as that's my UK reference point. I don't feel compelled in it's stories because it seems somewhat premium? The images with the families/kids seem really 'comfortable' which is great for them of course but my relationship to porridge and thus, quaker/scots oats is very different, you know?   I didn't like the ad as it had young people sitting around and drinking the drink, I feel like they'd be more likely to eat the bars. I don't like the prominence of the mascot as well, it feels unnecessary, I thought we would be moving away from mascots at people these days to be fair.   Family, food and ease of use (I noted the porridge packets, which used to be a life saver when I worked in an office). ",Harvest,
325426,Patrick,Smith,patricksmith02@gmail.com,"Quiet but passionate – often anxious, takes some time to open up to new people.  This is a korok from the Legend of Zelda games. They are playful, childlike forest spirits. I had an experience during a shamanic ceremony that I have a lot in common with these spirits. I have a model of one on my windowsill to remind me of who I am and the comfort I can find in my simple identity. It also connects me to my childhood as the Zelda games were a powerful way of engaging with story and fantasy, and a way for me and my sisters to connect.   My yoga mat is the most important part of my health and wellbeing. Doing regular yoga is what keeps me in touch with my body and helps me stay healthy. I have always been a very unfit, unflexible person, so trying to address that through yoga has been one of the biggest challenges but also most rewarding pursuits of my life.   My piano is my main emotional outlet. I can sit at the piano and understand how I'm really feeling that day. It is better than therapy. I don't need to play for anyone but myself.  I think I can much more easily think of brands that have disappointed me than brands that resonate with me. 

For example, I really like Oatly – high quality product, environmentally more sustainable than other milk alternatives... but their marketing is a bit nauseating (I wish the Innocent-style casual copy could have been put to rest a decade ago), and I really don't align with their values in terms of who holds their shares. 

I've had a few experiences of getting quite attached to a vegan/vegetarian brand, and then finding out something horrible about the way they run their business, or their lack of sustainability, and going off them. I rarely boycott products, but I find it really hard to maintain that same rosy attitude, or stick with one brand exclusively for very long.

There are lots of brands that I like, in that I buy them quite regularly, but I don't fully trust. One example is Smol – I use them because I think it's more sustainable, and their product is good quality, but I can't say they really ""get"" me.

I like Who Gives A Crap, and I've stuck with them for a while. But their marketing is that usual cringey casual-copy, and it's still heavily corporate, so I haven't completely fallen in love with them.

Then there's Dr Bronner's, who I really did fall in love with ideologically – their company has a salary cap so their CEOs can't earn ridiculous quantities compared to their lowest paid employees, and it's a family business that donates huge quantities of money to charitable issues. But then they started funding some questionable pursuits and saying some ignorant things about psychedelic decriminalization (I work in the psychedelic sector so it really rubbed me the wrong way). Now I still like them compared to most corporate brands but I can't quite proselytise about them to anyone.

I think for a brand to really 'get' me I'd like to see toned-down, simple marketing, but most importantly a B-corp or non-profit that was genuinely interested in business ethics and sustainability – not just surface level. Like Dr. Bronner's but without the questionable ethics. I'd like to see a brand that cared more about its actual impact in the world, in terms of environment and social justice, than its legacy. Somatic, Love, Purpose

Somatic – caring for the body. This involves exercise, sex, food, and sunlight. To be happy, I need to make sure my body is happy. Be aware of my body and exercise it through yoga. Explore its capacity for giving and receiving pleasure through sex. Feed it with the nutrients that it wants. Be outside enough to gain energy and strength from sunlight!

Love – caring about myself and others. Being passionate about other humans, especially those who are less privileged and more vulnerable. Knowing that love is the first step towards radical change. Loving myself and others can help to bring positive change into the world. Loving media and art that brings me joy and makes me understand my purpose.

Purpose – I may be a speck of dust, but I'm still here for a reason. I'm turning a cog somewhere in the belly of this unstoppable machine. I can decide how to turn that cog. How I turn that cog is, in fact, the most important thing in the world – even if it has no impact on the function of the machine. Having a sense of purpose, and a strength of conviction in my beliefs, while still keeping perspective, is key to wellbeing. Nutrition. Does the food or drink give my body what it needs.

Sustainability. How was the food or drink produced – who made it, what was the impact on the environment, does its production do more harm than good.

Quality. Does it taste good!

Ethics. Is the company highly corporate or ethically-minded.  Quality. Hellmann's vegan mayo is the best vegan mayo I've tried, and I've tried a lot. However it probably fails on the sustainability and ethical principles, as there are much more ethical brands of vegan mayo (i.e. Hellmann's makes non-vegan products too).   Ethics. Divine is probably one of the most ethical chocolate companies around. It is partly owned by an alliance of cacao farmers. Although there are still some issues, it's one of the most easily available higher-ethics chocolates around. I don't have any in the house right now because I've just eaten the last bar! So I've added a brand photo instead.   Sustainability. Any plant milk is more sustainable than cow milk, and I've chosen Oatly as my favourite brand for the time being. Oats can be more ethical to farm than almonds or coconuts, and Oatly has pledged to not use certain damaging chemicals in its oat farms. While it may be one of the most sustainable options for plant milk, it still fails ethically for me, I just haven't found a more ethical, high-quality alternative that is available to me.  Thankfully I've been doing that as I've gone along. I rarely find myself 100% happy with a brand, and even if I am, it usually doesn't last long. I am a subscriber to Ethical Consumer and often find some reason to lose passion for a brand after a few months. One example is Tony's Chocolonely, which used to be my favourite chocolate brand. They were producing slave-free chocolate, which is a rarity among most chocolate brands, and it tasted really good. However they recently were revealed to be partnering with a producer with questionable links to child labour. So while I may still buy Tony's occasionally, I have lost respect for them and would not consider them a 100% ethical buy. 

So the challenge I face with brands is figuring out what compromises I make. I drink Oatly even though they're owned in part by really unethical shareholders. I eat Divine chocolate even though the share that the original cacao farmers own has been dramatically reduced. I buy Dr Bronner's soap even though they've made some ignorant choices about their charity. 

I can never hope for a 100% ethical product, but I'm always looking for it.  I needed to get plant milk and noticed this pea milk. I'd just been reading about how pea milk was one of the most sustainable kinds of plant milk, and that it contains more protein than oat milk (my usual), so I thought I'd give it a try!   One thing I really miss about eating meat is the good luncheon meat. I miss the strong flavours and the easiness of being able to pick tasty sandwich fillings off the shelf. So I saw this fake tikka chicken and remembered how good these can be in wraps/sandwiches, and wanted to try out the non-meat version.   I like the Plant Kitchen branding, it's simple and clear. And my eye is always drawn to the small yoghurts because that's something I miss – being able to pick up small tasty pots of things. This one looked delicious.   I haven't tried these plant chorizo puppies before and wanted to try using them in Jambalaya. I'm of course excited by the idea that these could come anywhere near the flavour of chorizo!   I just buy own-brand juices or smoothies. So that usually means M&S or Tesco. I try to go for TetraPaks if they're available, which means I mostly avoid things like Innocent. I try not to buy those plastic smoothies as much any more, but I used to buy Tesco's own-brand smoothies quite a lot. I also avoid Innocent and go for own brands because I don't believe the price jump is worth it.   Tesco roasted salted pistachios – filling and has lots of fat which I sometimes lack in my diet. I like snacking on these and I don't see any need to go for an expensive brand. Nairns dark chocolate chip oat biscuits – I know these aren't super healthy but they're a little healthier than most biscuits. I find myself getting satisfied from them faster than most sugary treats.   Marketing. Plastic. Expensive.   Tasty. Quality. Shareholders.   Soy. Unethical. Not Vegan.   It's pretty! It definitely looks good and their photographers look like they know what they're doing.   Not really at all. I might be interested in trying one of their oat biscuits but I don't think I'd necessarily grab it off the shelf. There's no clear selling point and it just falls in with all the other breakfast foods I see at the supermaket.   I don't really know what the selling point is, although this might be because I can't speak Finnish. Nowhere do I see any reason why this should stand out from other breakfast foods. Some of the products seem to be gluten free but this doesn't seem to be an entirely gluten-free brand. Is there an emphasis on quick eating? Like, I see some packets that look like they're microwaveable or instant breakfasts. I don't think that's really emphasised. Also while the branding is overall quite pretty, the icon of the nordic girl is a bit off-putting to me, and it can make the brand look old-fashioned. Finally I'm a little picky about fonts and I don't understand why they've gone for a very hard angular capitalised font on some products, but quite gentle rounded lower-case fonts on others. I feel the latter probably fits their main logo a bit better.   Again it's hard to tell without speaking Finnish but I would guess there's an emphasis on health, because of the 'eat well' slogan? Is there maybe reduced sugar or gluten across their products? I guess it could be vegan, because I don't know the Finnish for vegan!! ",Harvest,
235001,Freya,Bromley,freyabromley@gmail.com,"Great question! I think my best friend would describe me as full of energy, loves adventure... and always has an itinerary!  I know that filofaxes are incredibly retro but I just love mine. The colour is so beautiful and it's an item on my desk that sparks joy for me.  Inside, I write a list of my priorities every day. That's a really important part of my day, checking in with myself about what I want to achieve and also finding focus amongst the noise of the longer ongoing lists I have on my phone etc.  I think it represents me because it's bright and shows my commitment to getting things done! 
   These are my groovy wetsuit socks. I love wild swimming all year and in winter and can get very cold. I usually wear a swimsuit instead of a wetsuit but like to have my toes warm. Wherever I am (at home, on holiday, visiting family) I bring them with me so I know I can swim in a pool, river, pond or the sea. Whatever the weather!   This is a scarf I sell on my business. During lockdown it has brought me real joy as I love the craftsmanship of it and the bright colours. Yellow, pink and green remind me of Spring! I've been wearing it as a face covering or sometimes when I'm on a zoom work meeting as a neck tie to brighten up my drab homeware (because realistically I wear the same clothes three days in a row).  When answering this question, I thought about mailing lists. Because mailing lists really annoy me and I unsubscribe a lot but there are a few that i really like. 

Thinx has to be my favourite! I love that they're eco-friendly and sex positive. Plus, their brand communication is great. I read a lot of sex tips, feminine hygiene tips and news about politics relevant to sexual health via their social media and newsletters. They're immersing me in what the brand represents and not always trying to sell me things. I've become a very loyal customer and recommend them to a lot of people. Go thinx!

I know everyone will say this but Innocent of course! I've been fortunate to work with them a few times and the whole brand (as a collaborator and consumer) is so genuine and authentic. Copy plays a big part of this and I like playful humour. It connects to me. Ok this might be cheating slightly, but I'm going to use Dr Chatterjees four pillars of health because they're very important to me. They are: Food, Rest, Sleep, Move. I

What I like about it so much as that sleep is central to his philopsphy of wellbeing. Until I read it, I didn't understand that it didn't matter how well I ate or how much exercise I did if I wasn't sleeping properly. It also has a strong focus on rest and downtime. I prioritise resting (having a walk, seeing friends, reading a book, listening to music) as equally important to exercise because it keeps me fit. 

On my phone I have some 'Daily Mantras' that I wrote down and regularly revisit. These are promises I've made to myself to keep me healthy, energised and focused. Some are about exercise (go for a walk every day) or health (drink water) and some are wellbeing (stick to your screentime limits, read before bed). I have tendencies to work way too much so I work hard to keep these commitments to me, now that I know what keeps me healthy. 

Those mantras all fit in to the four pillars. If I had to narrow them down to three, they would be: Sleep, Rest, Move. Sorry food! That's probably because I have quite a balanced diet already and, for me, it's the pillar I have to work the least hard at. Let's see if that stays true as I get older. 

P.S the daily mantras thing is super embarrasing ha! When it comes to choices, my friends are the biggest influence. We cook for each other a lot and often teach other new recipes. Two recent recommendations I loved were Innocent's hazelnut milk (my friend shared a flask of this with me post-swim and now it's my fave warm evening drink) and also The British Porridge Cos instant porridge (my friend loves it and so do I now). 

I find recipes on cookbooks, Pinterest and also the Deliciously Ella app. If I see ingredients in there that are repeated, then I'll add them to my next shop. 

Also: I'm embarrassed to admit I do get influenced by social media ads. Mostly on Instagram! That said, if I see sponsored #ads from influencers I think they seem very fake for me.  [I'm moving house so I've uploaded photos rather than taken them.] SLEEP. My Lumie alarm clark helps me wind down as it makes the room darker when I'm reading then brightens in the morning to wake me up! Plus, it means less screen time as I  don't have to use my phone for an alarm.  It's a product I recommend to lots of my friends as it's a home essential for me.   REST. This wooden cookbook holder is great in my kitchen because I change the cookbook on it regularly and having it on the kitchen surface puts recipes front of my mind. It also means I don't get lazy and just look at BBC Good Food on my phone but take time out at the end of the day to experiment with new recipes. That's why this represents rest, as my cooking (and no phone) time at the end of a work day is really relaxing to me.  
   EAT. I have a bowl I bought from Sicily, it's handpainted and I love the lemon design. I always try to have lots of fruit in my kitchen to keep me healthy. So having the bowl on my worktop reminds me to fill it up, and eat from it. I even have a fruit and veg subscription which I collect locally called Local Greens.  Being busy. When I'm juggling lots, I find it difficult to prioritise rest, sleep and being healthy. Also this is when I crave sugar, carbs and alcohol!

My social life. If I have a few nights out my calendar can get busy. Although this can be a 'challenge' I try not to be frustrated by it because it's important to see my friends and if we go out and have dinner and it means I stay out late and have an unhealthy meal, that's ok. 

Screen time. My phone is usually the biggest obstacle to me getting good rest and sleep. Also, social media often makes me hungry or puts me in a bad mood (which also makes me want to eat unhealthy foods).  This is my go-to product. I put this oat milk in my tea, coffee, cereal and also use it as a replacement for milk in recipes.  
 I used to buy Oatly then found that I couldn't find it stocked in my local supermarket and tried Alpro. I liked it, and when the 'No Sugar' version came out and I just became loyal to that because I have it all the time. The branding and actual brand don't really 'mean' anything to me or speak to me in a particular way. I think my loyalty came from quite a passive choice of Oatly being unavailable.  
 Sometimes I buy the ambient one, but I  always try to get the chilled one.  Are they the same? I'm not sure. I don't think I notice the taste and put it in the fridge anyway.  It tastes amazing and is no added sugar. So it's healthy. Hooray! Also, I have found I  never have that feeling of my tummy being full of dairy so that is healthy as well.   
 Note: today I also saw this new Alpro tea product. I picked it up and looked at it. But was a bit confused by it. I think I thought, 'Oh well whats wrong with my current Alpo in tea? It already tastes nice. Why are you trying to sell me another one?'   This yoghurt is my favourite! It's so delicious and tastier than any ice cream or sweet treat. I was initially drawn to it because the passionfruit swirled through the yoghurt looks colourful and enticing. It reminded me of a solero and it tastes like that too. I a lso  I like the tub shape and size . The branding is funky and young which attracted me. It really stands out to me because it isn't the usual bullshit yoghurt branding of 'healthy probiotic women's health stand in the kitchen wearing pastel eating an activia' vibe.  
 Now that I know I like it, I've tried other products from the brand. Although when I thought about it for this task , I don't know this brand by name. Just 'the passionfruit yoghurt I like'.  Because it's a yoghurt I consider it quite healthy (it is, right?!) so have no guilt adding it to my basket. I usually ignore  the serving suggestion and add a spoon straight to the tub.  Joyous!   
 I also added the mango one (which seems to be a new one-serving size). So I added that because, why not... it's yoghurt! 
 Note: today I saw some keffir products by the brand. I  glanced at them and thought, 'oh yes keffir I've heard people talk about that' but decided I sounded a bit 'hempy' if you get my drift and decided I didn't care enough to try it, even though it was on offer.    How could anyone not find this appealing?! The shape and size of the product feels very satisfying to hold. I like the colour and the design. And the words Whippable. Vanilla. Custard. Just seemed divine to me. Also I think the fun illustration of the apple drew me in.  
 No idea what I will eat this on. But walking past I thought, 'Oooh that looks tasty' and probably a fun way to enjoy fruit.   I saw a few home coffee products that I want to try. As I'm not spending lots of money on takeout coffee, I'm drawn to these fridge iced lattes which non-dairy milk as I know they'll have the sweetness of oat milk or almond milk rather than the Starbucks iced coffees which have sweetners in and are too sickly.  
 I've seen a lot of advertising for the brand Minor Figures. At first I was like, 'what a stupid advert I have no idea what that brand is.' And now I've done a 360 and like the vibe. It's minimal and the Typography is groovy. I've seen it on tote bags in London too (I'm sorry, this probably means I'm way more susceptible  to marketing than I like to admit). This seems like a perfect chance to try it!   Tropicana. I buy the one with bits. Usually if I have a guest or it's the weekend as a treat. I would never buy any other orange juice as the own brand ones taste awful. I  grew up with Tropicana being a family treat, so this is an emotional buy for me. Very brand loyal.   
 I love the Innocent brand and used to buy the green smoothies sometimes but have since realised they have a crazy amount of sugar. So if I'm going to have a drink with that much sugar, I'd rather have Tropicana. Also, I've since learned there are other ways I can get my vitamins.  
 Shakes? Not sure what that is. Like a Fridg? Never bought that.   I try to avoid 'snacking'. I associate snacking with treats and also being impulsive with food so I try to have filling meals. I would maybe snack if I was 'on the go'.   
 A food I have at home that I eat as lunch but could be classed as a snack is the Kallo rice cakes. The beetroot flavour and also pea flavour are SO GOOD! I could have them plain or I like to have them with baba ganoush and falafel. They're healthy and delicious. I was tempted to trying these because I like the organic feel of the Kallo brand and liked the idea of more flavour in a usually brand rice cake and the colour of the packaging.   
 I  recently tried Daisy &  Dom. The mix of dark chocolate and nut butters was so tasty. I went out of my way to buy these at Holland &  Barrat I  thought they were so tasty.    Cool. And even cooler 5 years ago. One of the few brands I follow on Instagram because I think they're funny. They're appealing to me less and less because I don't buy sugary juices or smoothies. But... they've recently reeled me back in with the hazlenut milk which I have warm.   Very cool. I like the branding. Sometimes it's hit and miss on whether it's available. This gave the opportunity for Alpro to steal the show for me. I also saw something bad about them not being super eco and having dodgy investors.   My go to oat milk! It's interesting because this is probably the #1 most regular product I  buy.  yet I feel no affinity to the brand.  It also doesn't feel like it's trying to connect to me. Despite that, I know I  like the taste.  It's healthy.  And I can rely on it always being in the shop.    I am a bit obsessed with all things Scandi (aren't we all?) and have read lots about Hygge and spent time in Denmark with family. I think it's a real cultural trend that we assume their culture holds the key to happiness. So I really identify with that statement in the ad.  I liked the post that was the porridge with the flasks outside, that felt very scandi and aspirational to me. Having a porridge on a walk outside. Bliss!
 I also like the rustic / traditional branding with the modern navy. Feels quite authentic to me.   The first image was very compelling to me. I loved the navy and also the cute flower mug, it reminded me of Marimekko which is a brand I like.  I'm also a big porridge fan, so this seems like it would have some products I could try  Plus, the packaging (of the boxed drink someone was drinking in the advert) looked recyclable to me.   I was really liking the advert and the authenticity of it. The a nature and people eating together. The IG page feels a bit 'basic b' to me. The influencer content doesn't feel authentic at all, and that Scandi feel is gone (which I appreciate is because it's a local page).  The slogan 'feel free to eat' didn't resonate with me. I almost felt defensive like 'why wouldnt I feel free to eat?'   Hmm. It looks like it has a family focus. Family and natural ingredients. I'm not really sure what else... it didn't speak to me much about any particular values. ",Harvest,
434396,Joanne,Allison,joannejaneallison@gmail.com,"I'd hope that my best friends would describe me a bit like this...
Jo is a caring and open friend and the listening ear I'd call when I need support, but also when I want a laugh down the pub.  This is the necklace that I wear every day. It holds my engagement and wedding ring, two pendants bought for me by some of my best friends when my two sons were born, and a ring that was my Grannie's that my mum was wearing the day she died.  
 It represents the different sides to me - that I'm a wife, mum, and friend. And it also symbolises the fact that I carry loss around with me too. I suppose the fact that I've chosen this shows that I'm quite sentimental and that it's my friends and family that are most important to me. 
   These are my walking boots. We live in Sheffield and going out for long walks at the weekend with my family is one way I like to relax and unwind and is currently the main way that I keep fit. I'm currently on maternity leave and one of my favourite things to help my mental and physical wellbeing is to go for a walk with the buggy and listen to a podcast. Sheffield is very hilly, and I currently live in quite a rural area, so I wear walking boots for trips to the shop and on the nursery run too!   This is my Ikat Kantha Quilt which I sleep under every night. It brings me joy because it's beautifully crafted and brightens up the room. It also holds lots of memories for me - it was one of the first things my husband and I bought for our first flat together. It's since come with us to every house and flat that we've lived in together. I also absolutely love sleep, and I've not had much of it since becoming a mum - so my bed has become an even more joyous place to be!  Beyond Nine is a slow fashion / clothing brand that I think really speaks to me and understand what I want and need. 
The brand only has a limited number of items - it prides itself in high quality fabrics that last for years - so ticks the 'ethical/eco' box for me. The idea is that it can be worn for the 9 months of pregnancy, and then beyond - clothing is breastfeeding friendly, well-cut to flatter changing bodies and to some extent 'timeless' in that they don't follow fashion trends / fads. It also doesn't make me feel bad that my body has changed after pregnancy - it's almost celebrated/expected.
The way they talk to their customers - via Instagram and over email is really personal. The brand was started by a mum too, so you feel that they really 'get you' as a fellow parent. The brand does shout-outs for 'real' models and shows its clothes on women of different sizes. Not ground-breaking, but it all adds up.
The brand started with a jumpsuit, as it's a 'cool' outfit in just one garment - really easy to throw on (for women that maybe don't have as much time as they once did) and the garments allow you to keep a sense of identity through clothing without much fuss. Connections - at the root of my happiness is people - talking and spending time with family and friends. The pandemic has really shown me the importance of this, and the detrimental impact on mental health not being able to make the most and enjoying these connections has. It's highlighted the joy of meeting up for a walk in the park, or having friends round for dinner. Both deep and daily / surface-level connections are a huge source of happiness for me. I love a chatter with my hairdresser and I find friendly interactions in shops and at bus stops provide small boosts of happiness. Ona a much deeper level, my family and friends provide a lot of support which keeps my mental health on track.

Sleep - I've mentioned it earlier, but sleep is hugely important for me. A good nights sleep improves my frame of mind, it increases my energy and enables me to be a more positive and present person - be it at work, or looking after my children. Having increased energy levels means that I in turn make more healthy food choices and am able to enjoy running / cycling. 

Active - by the word 'active' I don't just mean doing a gym class or going for a run (although that's important too). I also mean making plans, being busy and getting out and about - living a more exciting life. Again, the pandemic really highlighted how important having a full social calendar, with lots of different activities planned is a huge part of a happy and healthy life. Simplicity - is it a quick fix? Easy to turn into a healthy lunch? Does it take a lot of preparation / faffing around.
Locally produced / seasonal - where does it come from? Is it organic?
Nutritious - I look at the ingredients - sugar and salt being big red flags. Can I switch out for a more nutritious option?
Family - friendly - can we all eat it? Will my picky toddler enjoy it too?
Plant - based alternatives - my husband is a vegan so I often look for plant-based alternatives that we can all eat so that I'm not making multiple meals 
Taste - this is obviously a leading factor in decision-making!  Simplicity - is it a quick fix? We buy Merchant Gourmet lentils and mixed grain packets every week and use them as a base for our lunches, as a way of not just eating sandwiches and ensuring that we get fibre and nutrients. They are ready to eat, and we warm them in the microwave for a minute. We also buy Chopped spinach and Frozen fruit and use that in a similar way - easy to add into curries or into yogurt.   Family - friendly - can we all eat it? Strong Roots (https://www.strongroots.com/uk/) is a frozen food brand that offers vegan and healthier alternatives to oven chips / waffles / hash browns - the quick kiddy meals that I grew up with. The Cauliflower hash browns and Mixed root vegetable fries are firm favourites with our toddler, and they taste great too so it doesn't feel like we're eating junk.   Plant - based alternatives.  We've tried numerous alt milk and yogurt brands as I love both cows milk and regular yogurt. These are the two brands that masquerade as dairy the best in my opinion / are the tastiest. Oatly 'no milk' drink for tea/coffee and cereal. The barista edition is super creamy, just like full-fat milk, and tastes great in a latte. The Coconut Collaborative coconut-based yogurt is also really versatile - we use it in cooking as well as for breakfast / with fruit etc.  Time - juggling two kids, keeping a house going, paid work - there is a lot going on that mean quick-fixes often win in the battle of nutrition versus speed. I'd love to be able to spend more time planning meals, cooking different foods and experimenting more.

Availability - not all supermarkets sell the brands or have as good choices when it comes to plant-based alternatives especially.

Price - you pay a premium for convenient food and for organic/local produce. Obviously we don't have a never-ending supply of cash, so making this a priority does make our weekly shopping bill quite high.

Repetitive - having young children who don't necessarily eat a huge range of different foods, and a husband who eats mainly plant-based food, means that the meals I end up cooking aren't as varied as they could be.  Kefir Coconut - gut health. Tried to 'enjoy' kefir in the past, but havent' found it appealing. Always on the lookout for new foods to improve my immune system and gut health in particular.   Butter with Maldon sea salt. small luxury. nostalgic for french holidays. grab a quick slice of toast and butter. the packaging was stand-out for me - UK made, wholesome, expensive quality-looking product   proper indulgence. Salted caramel is a firm favourite. altratives to chocolate, ones that are just as tasty. only 122 calories, a small pot. I've added this to my basket, and maybe a pure chocolate version too!!   clean looking packaging. a new exciting ingredient that I've not tried before.   1. Cawston Press Apple and Pear Cartons 
 We buy it because: These are drunk by our nearly-three year old. We find cartons useful on day trips out, or when walking home from nursery etc. We choose this brand as the brand uses paper straws, no plastic, no added sugar or sweetners and I perceive the brand to be a healthy, good-quality brand. My husband and I have been known to sneak a carton for ourselves. And we really like the Cawston Press sparkling cans - that's how we found these juice cartons.  
 2. Happy Monkey Smoothies 
 We buy it because: These are drunk by our toddler. These are seen as a 'treat' drink by our son because of the colourful packaging and the flavour combinations taste really sweet. For us as parents, it's a good way to get him to get a portion of fruit. They are also often on offer! 
 3. Taste the difference Orange Juice with bits 
 We buy it because: We buy a carton of juice a week, and have it in small quantities first thing in the morning (we are often up very early and it helps us wake up!!) This is our favorite. It's got a really great, deep orange flavour (as near to pressed juice as we've found) and we believe the Sainsbury's Taste The Difference range in general to be high quality, and worth spending a bit more on.
   We never really bought 'snacks' before we had a child. We'd just eat a piece of fruit or have a slice of toast/crumpet if we were hungry between meals. Or perhaps a biscuit with a cup of tea. But that's changed since having a child. 1. The Happy Snack Company Roasted Fava beans 
 We buy it because: our son loves pom bear crisps, and bread sticks - anything crunchy! So I've been trying to find alternatives to crisps that offer more nutrition. These are high in protein and fibre - two food groups I sometimes worry my son doesn't eat enough of. The small packets mean they can easily be carried on days out / in handbags etc. 
 2. Organix Raisins We buy it because: raisins are a mess-free and portable way to get our son to a portion of fruit. Can be popped in a handbag / eaten almost like a little box of sweets. I don't have brand loyalty to Organix - we sometimes buy a bigger packet of raisins and put them into tupperware pots, but the pre-packed boxes are very convenient. 
 
 3. Babybel cheese  We buy it because: again, it's a portable, low-mess snack. The 'opening ritual' of pulling off the red wax coating is fun for our son. It's also very nostalgic for me as I had these as a child. Babybel is a brand that I trust as it seems to have been around forever! 
   Wooly hats, sugar, thick   Healthy, milk, barista   Yogurt, bitter, dull   I like that the brand included people across the generations in it's advert. Feels very family-friendly and like it's a positive choice for feeding your family. It seems very wholesome and healthy and I think that's communicated well.   Not very - lacking in personality/ and I can't pin-point anything 'stand out' or unique about what it's offering. The lack of diversity in the advert and Instagram feed is very apparent - a bit too blonde hair and blue eyed!   The brand seems very outdated to me - from the packaging and font used, to the staged photos used on the Instagram feed and the all-white actors used in the TV ad. It feels like the brand needs to rethink it's image for 2021.   Traditional values / family values / healthy and hearty food ",Harvest,
434394,Rebecca,Whittaker,beckywhittaker@live.co.uk,"I think I would be described as creative, practical and usually the Mum of the group, I love to have fun with my friends but I'm an introvert at heart.  My Apron! This item probably shows both my journey into motherhood and my love of cooking, 2 things that are incredibly important to me   I would call this yoga mat my sanity over the last year. I have always loved yoga and practised regularly for the last 5 years but since lockdown and the global pandemic, yoga has been such a life line for me, keeping my mind calm as well as being good for my physical wellbeing.   This is a ring that my Mum bought me for my 18th birthday which I wear every day, it's very special to me  TALA is a sustainable female owned active wear brand. I think the marketing to people of my age group is fantastic, they've understood the desire for shopping more sustainably whilst still being able to buy new items that are fashionable.
I find their marketing campaigns really inspiring as they go above and beyond to be inclusive of different sized women of all ethnicities as well as less able bodied people. 

I think in general brands should be looking for ways of becoming more sustainable, using recyclable packaging, less plastic and ethically sourcing their products. Food, Human connection, staying active

Food: I love cooking, I think a good diet is key to staying healthy and happy as well as an important way of connecting with others

Human Connection: Friendship and romantic, our loved ones keep us sane and mentally well! 

Staying active: Walking, Yoga, Gym, swimming, I love staying active, aside from the obvious way it keeps my body healthy, it also allows me to meet new people and have new experiences. My main principle with my diet is getting in a range of nutrition from different sources that are also hopefully are more sustainable options.  

I try and have a minimum of 2 fruits or vegetables per meal and eat lots of colourful produce  
Drinks I prefer to have a low sugar option or fruit juice, though mainly I drink water. 
I keep my meals fairly consistent Mon-Fri which helps me manage my budget and is easier during the week to prepare
I've reduced my meat intake so I look for alternative meat substitutes that are high protein, usually these are free range eggs or vegan sausages 
Meals need to be healthy but without too much prep or fuss, fairly quick to make  I love this brand for creating super quick meals for my son, I feel better serving him 'freezer food' knowing he's getting lots of veg whilst still in a 'kid' friendly form.   This Brand has helped me get into meat alternatives, probably because of their wide product range and good branding/packaging. It's made the switch to more vegan options much easier as I don't have to completely change which meals I'm making, I can use substitutes.   Less this particular brand but a blender/smoothie maker has been one of the main ways I've been able to up my fruit/veg intake, as well as getting in supplements (protein/creatine/fibre) which I have found has massively helped my diet and is very quick to use  I think my biggest challenge as a working mum is time. Thinking of new things to cook, making sure meals are healthy but also tasty (will be eaten by a 3yr old!). Shopping for the meals as well, and making sure the cost of the shop is within budget are all challenges and once that's all done the meal has to be cooked as well! 
I feel like going into a supermarket can often be a mine field and when you find a good option- new vegan product, healthier snack or anything that fits into the sustainable/ethical category- its usually priced too high to be bought regularly for a weekly shop.  I love this brand, both of their children’s range (previously mentioned) and for adults, it’s typical freezer food that is quick to bung in the oven after a long day but actually has loads of veg packed in. Packaging is always very appealing, I feel less guilty eating these when I want something quick!   mini milks were a childhood favourite of mine, I saw these and they made me smile, just something fun, that remind me of holidays. Jude’s icecream seems much better quality ingredients than Walls which is why I picked this brand, and I know they have a focus on being more environmentally friendly too- joy all round!   I chose this brand as I think they have a really unique product and marketing amongst many other milk alternatives. I think it’s priced well and they seem to know their customer, showing the nutrition information clearly on the front of the bottle. I like the bright colours on all their products, I think it looks interesting and eye catching.   I’m still getting into vegan alternatives so this brand appealed as they had so many options of ‘normal’ food that is vegan. Sausage rolls in particular are a guilty pleasure for me so if I can find a vegan alternative that’s not from Greggs that would be great!   Innocent smoothies- I like all the different flavour options these come in as well as the branding on the bottle which makes all the ingredients really clear and friendly/ appealing that you know what is in each bottle. 
 No.1 Kombucha- I like this as an alternative to fizzy drinks, I like that the bottles are really eye catching and they have lots of unique flavours   Bear fruit yoyos- this is a snack for my son, I like that this brand uses all natural ingredients and uses fruit as the only natural sugar source. I think it provides parents with a good alternative to heavily processed children’s snacks. Graze lemon flapjacks- I love these as a snack for on the go, they are packaged individually which makes them very convenient to take out with you. I like that whilst it is still a ‘treat’ item there is still a lot of thought about the nutritional content and feels like a better alternative to nature valley (for example) which is a lot more processed.   friendly, fun, healthy   alternative, political, coffee   adverts, yoghurt, vegan   I think their marketing is really good, their instagram has lots of nice photos, and the advert is really warm and comforting   I think fairly compelling, they have lots of different products which look interesting but it’s hard to see the main focus of the brand which is maybe why it doesn’t completely capture my attention   I think the packaging is a little old fashioned especially the font and the logo makes it a little bit unclear as to what it is selling   Family, well-being, community and sharing ",Harvest,
434395,Naomi,Filio,naomijfilio@gmail.com,"Probably describe me as: creative and diligent. Often busy doing five things at once and easily distracted :joy: Let's others opinions and perceptions weigh too heavily so can try too hard to please -work in progress in this area!  My glue gun!:joy: It helps me be creative, it's messy, great for my im patience, doesn't need to be neat, works well, works hard    My sewing machine. Place where I can relax, be inspired, be creative, make things for my daughter, was gifted by a dear friend and got me through a difficult time in my life.   First thing that came to mind was my aeropress. So satisfying to make a consistently good cup. Always has a sense of peace as it is the slowness of the morning before the day is in full swing. I enjoy choosing the ""right"" mug for the day and the entire process is satisfying. It was a Christmas gift and I treated myself to the milk frother so these bring an undercurrent of joy too :)  Alter/Native - I use their shampoo bars. They understand the need to reduce plastic waste and they are reasonably priced. 

M&S foos - they do just deliver on good quality food. I don't buy it often but it is a nice treat. Actually, I often get their grain salads for lunch - easily accessible at petrol station on the way to work, healthy, full of good calories so is filling and so much more enjoyable than a sandwich. Security (job, home, relationships)
Adventure (trying new things, exploring, learning, growing, changing)
Boundaries (knowing your limits, knowing when to bend, knowing when to hold fast, knowing when to give and when to take).

These aren't related specifically to healthy eating so I can do one more focused if that helps? I do think that when these things are in balance I feel better and then my life reflects my healthiness naturally in my food choices, my tidiness etc etc. '- good amount of fruit and veg (classic)
- fresh as much as possible
- good calories (I have a preteen so she needs to be eating enough)
- not too much sugar
- no sweeteners where possible'  Fruit/Veg intake Store brand OJ. Can't beat it. Morning luxury. Tastes great, good price point, one fruit already, started the day with something that feels indulgent to me! We only had concentrate OJ growing up. I only buy the ""brands"" if they are on offer i.e Innocent/Tropicana. Just because it feels expensive for not a huge difference. Although a meal deal does entice me for the innocent drinks at lunch!   Good calories/Limited sugar/no sweeteners Good hearty cereal! Porridge, Weetabix and bran flakes or 'shreddies'. For these I actually only buy the brand Weetabix, porridge is store brand and the others I usually check the sugar content and go for the lowest (store/brand dependant). I have found no good substitute for Weetabix- texture and size make this win out.  
 Nairn's cheese oat cakes. Delicious. Worth every penny. Healthy. Filling and a good snack for packed lunch. My daughter has an enamel issue so I am conscious of how much sugar she eats. These are a good teeth snack although pretty boring in her eyes! She does love salt crackers. Probably too much sodium but they are very yummy and moreish. We always have crackers in the cupboard.   Convenient, healthy' in that it gives calcium and good calories. (Sorry that's 3!) These are great for packed lunch. More filling than crisps or other snacks of that ilk. Straightforward - cheese. Packaged in a way that I can portion easily. My daughter doesn't love milk so this is a helpful addition to her diet.  Time/energy to cook. Even though the oven stuff ends up taking longer it initially seems appealing when you're tired but in the end it often isn't as tasty and you have to wait longer than something I've pulled together. 

Variety, new ideas. I can get so stuck on the same meals. I know them, can cook them, can plan and buy quickly so it's hard to break out of that and take the time to look at recipes, write the list, practice and hone it and add it to the repertoire. 
Eating less meat. Linked to the above. Takes more energy, brain power and time as it's not as familiar. I am not as confident and often worry meals are not filling enough. I have managed to add a few into my regulars but I'd like to be more proficient. 

Time and energy is the biggest issue I think. That's when I cut corners. Buy the quick meal, grab the more sugary packed lunch snacks etc, etc.  I ended up buying these (suckies) as they actually are convenient! I have never noticed or looked specifically in this aisle section past my usual purchases so haven't ever really considered them. Once I got past the idea of sucking yogurt it makes so much sense as you don't lose spoons in school packed lunches. I was rummaging through the cutlery draw this morning trying to find one that it wouldn't mind if it didn't make it's was home. This brand has only naturally occurring sugar from the milk and fruit. The only drawback is I doubt I can recycle these. Nice flavours - the banana sounds yum and perhaps not a typical yogurt flavour. I chose these over the others because as it says there are ""no nasties"" ingredients! The packaging looks slightly more sophisticated and pleasant than the frubes and wildlife yoplait. It is expensive and they are clearly taking advantage of the packed lunch market. I should just invest in some cheap spoons, small Tupperware to decant the large plain yogurt and add raspberries and blueberries instead. However, that isn't convenient and quick. (Sorry forgot to take photos of alternatives so grabbed screenshots my online) 
 Update: my daughter ended up having one after dinner and she really enjoyed it. I tried a slurp! The flavour was relatively subtle but that's the no added flavourings etc so I don't mind that at all.   I remember having cocopops with whole milk delivered in the glass bottle to the door when I was little. I loved the first pour, the creamy milk. Now, this would be a nostalgic, holiday treat buy  I chose this over the Sains own as the packaging looks more quaint and farm based. I would prefer to think I was supporting a farm rather than Sainsbury's However, I'm not actually sure whether the monetary difference of them buying and selling as their brand Vs Graham's but either way it got me to chose it!  The milk in the Sains one looks creamier but that actually wasn't enough to push me to choose that one. If it were in a glass bottle rather than plastic which you could return to the shop that would be even better. I did have fresh milk delivered in glass for a while as we go through a plastic  bottle a week but unfortunately it would go off too soon.   This looks tasty! I'm a sucker for 'iced' coffee to have on the go. This is actually a bigger size. I checked if they have smaller sizes but they didn't that this store/possibly not at all. This doesn't seem to be too sweet, is espresso X2 and is made with almond milk so sounds yummy. I chose this one due to the almond milk as I think it tastes better than long life cow milk  The bottle looks appealing too. I did almost double take whether it was Starbucks coffee as the logo is vaguely similar.   Okay, I was torn between two so I'm going to upload both. I actually hadn't realised this was Innocent until I read the back/ingredients and their style of writing made it apparent. So I think I was drawn by the packaging over the brand. I like that you can see the liquid, you can see the colour, the texture. It looks creamy but not too thick. The colour looks good. Kind of how I would imagine hazelnut! I love hazelnuts and this looks refreshing and decadent. I like that you can actually see how much is left in the bottle too. The alpro looks slightly more clinical. 
 
 
 I then noticed this Jörd oat milk which I had completely bypassed twice. I think I missed it as the packaging isnt particularly ""loud"". I actually ended up getting both the oat and 'oat and barley' to try out of interest because I use oat milk for coffee and I needed to top up. The flavours sound awesome. I haven't heard of this brand before at all. Despite saying I liked the clear bottle this packaging is ok and quite attractive. Looks 'organic/natural' even though I feel ridiculous saying that. I liked that it gave you suggestions of what to use it for (which is why I ended up getting the barley one too as they recommended it for coffee and I'm intrigued by the flavour). I bought the oat to compare to Oatly (my usual). I like the Oatly brand although I think I'm just out of their target audience. The packaging is simple and pleasant. I like that they advocate recycling. I got drawn in by a pop up coffee stand giving free coffee with Oatly milk. Seeing them froth with it and hearing them explain which of their milks is best for coffee and how they make it suitable with fat content etc made it a serious contender for milk. I haven't looked back. Tried others and the taste wasn't the same or the froth was too flat so I've been drinking this for probably about 2 years. I haven't made the transition to cereal yet. I am curious as to whether the oat and barley will work well with Weetabix etc so I'll give that a whirl this week. :)   Store brand juice 
 Innocent smoothies 
 
 
 Store brand juice. Asda actually have a great selection of juice not from concentrate. Although you have to check the sugar as the cherry and certain others have sweetener added. The Asda specially selected or whatever they call it is the bomb but it's so expensive so I devour that at my partner's flat and I buy the store brand one :speak_no_evil:. The juicy bits OJ is my favourite but the selection means I usually switch it up so we don't get bored. So apple and pear/ apple and mango etc.  
 
 
 Innocent juice or smoothies.  
 I'm not a fan of smoothies as I find the texture too cloying. But my daughter loves them. I buy these if they are on offer. I remember them coming onto the market and I've stuck with them ever since. The flavours are mostly good and the price ok. I sometimes hesitate over the Naked brand when getting a lunch meal deal but invariably I go with innocent. I prefer the packaging. The flavours are more appealing and you know what is in it (2 apples, 15 grapes) I always find that fun info!  
 We have frozen fruit in the freezer and I have a carton of concentrate juice in the cupboard in case we run out of breakfast juice so we can whip one up. Or I sub in milk and make a icecreamyesque drink.  
 
   Nairn's cheese oat cakes 
 I don't think any other brand does cheese...:thinking:. When I bought Aldi's they were actually unpalatable - wrong texture, not creamy, not cheesy, tasted dry. I actually binned them in the end once I got over the guilt of not eating them and they had probably gone out of date! They come in small packets which although more plastic is great for work snacks.  
 
 
 Mini Bread sticks. Store brand 
 Great for packed lunch or snack if we're out for the day. I actually have only noticed store brand only of the mini, single size packs. I'd definitely pay more and try a brand but I just don't think they're sold. Unless my blinkered vision is on! My daughter does prefer a particular one and I remember noticing it has more olive oil but now I've just checked the ingredients for Sains, Tesco and Asda and they all seem to have the same. I buy whichever shop I'm in for ease and frequently they are sold out so I get when I can and I'm not fussy. We have tried buying the larger breadsticks that have nicer flavours or seeds but I end up wasting as I can never find a tub to fit them which fits with the other Tupperware in her packed lunch   Fresh, fruit, tasty   Creamy, frothy, coffee   Almond, clinical, healthy   It looks appetising. I nteresting flavours. I like that it seems creative i.e. you can adapt and add to the products. Versatile products.   
 I like the ease (small portioned packets - great for packed lunches and hiking). (For an extra ++ I would like to see these as a paper based packaging. Ben & Jerry's have got cookie dough pops that are made from 80% paper so can recycle. My daughter noted this and at 11 she is conscious of waste).  
 Seem like a very tempting alternative to milk products. The drinks seem to be vegan.  
 
 They seem quite exciting and conscious of creating interesting and tasty alternatives.   I have actually just saved a couple of their recipes from instagram as the pancakes look great: easy, nutritious and tasty. The homemade smoothies are right up our street too and I hadn't thought of adding oats.  
 I am actually really tempted by the porridge pots too. I buy oat sachets but I have to remember to take my own milk into work. These are all done and do look good. I'm interested to know how sweet they are. 
 
 
 Ooh the oat carrot rolls sound intriguing. Good for adding a bit of variety to packed lunches and includes veg. Win.  
 My daughter and I hike and camp so the oat biscuit snacks may be a great snack to keep energy levels high. Ooh and I've just seen the oat chocolate milk that can be warmed -a great post walk, pre camp sleep drink.  
 
 
 I would assume that the products are healthy and nutritious from the emphasis on 'active' photos. They actually appeal to me as they seem to sit between ease and being able to add your own twist.   I am not 100% sold on the woman logo. My daughter said ""she looks old fashioned"". They may be going for that 'good old fashioned, hearty food' vibe. The insta account and the branding doesn't come across as particularly diverse and that bothers me. 
 I prefer the images of the food and recipes rather than the people. More appealing and inspiring.  
 Having said on initial impression video that I wasn't sure about the blue. I think it's actually ok. Looks crisp, clean.   Healthy

334747,Rebecca,Li,rebecca.qingyuli@yahoo.com,"Ambitious and thoughtful...like to socialise over food/food-related activities  My books (in particular my current favorite book: Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng), because I love reading and writing.   My water bottle, gifted from my friend. I suffer from a condition that leaves me extremely dehydrated, so hydration is very important for me to stay healthy and mobile, so my water bottle never leaves my side.   My non-stick pan, which i cook virtually everything on. My day and a majority of my excitement everyday revolves around my meals and what I cook for lunch and dinner.  Modern Picnic, which creates stylish and chic lunch bags for the modern-day working woman. I think the products were exactly what I needed for school and work, as I like to make my own food rather than buy lunch everyday, but also hate the idea of using childish lunch boxes (because I wasn't able to find anything suitable for adults). I also love that they are sustainable and are made with vegan leather. Mental Health, ""Normal"" Body, Personal Success. 

Mental Health, because I believe that being mentally content and happy with oneself is a vital part of living a ""happy and healthy life.""
""Normal"" body, because as someone from a family that does have health conditions, I understand that simply having a ""normal"" functioning body for some people is impossible/very difficult. I think it's really important to maintain a diet and active lifestyle that nourishes and protects ones body from sickness. 
Personal Success, because I value my personal dreams and build my life towards the direction of my goals, and I find happiness from my accomplishments. However, I also believe that every single person has a different definition of success/values in life, so I don't think there is a sole definer of ""success,"" which is why it is personal. 1) Fruit for dessert. I try to avoid artificial foods and high amounts of sugar, so I try to fulfil my sweet cravings with healthy sugars.

2) I try to incorporate health supplements, vitamins, etc into my everyday lifestyle to make sure I am getting all the nutrients and boosts I need, especially during the winter and flu season. 

3) Recently I've been alternating between ""vegetarian"" and ""no-carb"" meals for both sustainability and health reasons. For example, if I have a vegetarian lunch, I'll allow myself meat or seafood for dinner, but then I'd try to have a a meal with no main carbs (such as pasta or rice).  Fruit for dessert. I always have fruit in the house to fulfil my sugar cravings throughout the day.   Incorporating health supplements and vitamins into my everyday lifestyle to boost my general health. I really enjoy this brand's products because their teas make it easy for me to take supplements and ensure I have my necessary (and additional) ""health boosts"" for my immune system everyday.   Alternating between vegetarian and ""no-carb"" meals. Shirataki noodles are amazing for my meals because they are low in calories, have no carbs, and are vegan-friendly. I love how versatile they are, as I can substitute them within a variety of cuisines. I love this brand especially because the product is organic, and it is affordable.  The hardest thing to cut out of my diet is sugar. It is especially hard because I live with a roommate who loves to bake sweets, so I always have temptation nearby.
The other hard thing is that many health brands and products are quite expensive. This makes eating good-tasting healthy food quite difficult as the most affordable situation just ends up being salads and baked veggies, which can get really boring and repetitive.  I chose the Lupak Spreadable Lighter Butter because  1) it's a brand thats recognisable and that I know is good, which is convenient for my day-to-day when I don't have a lot of time to look at every product. The product itself is also more convenient than traditional block butters because its spreadable and easy for toast or to bake with. 2) Its the healthier choice compared to other butters: reduced fat, with rapeseed oil, and low in sodium.   I thought this would give me joy because it gives me a sense of nostalgia. I grew up eating 'I can't believe it's not Butter!' and I love the taste of it.   I chose this brand because it's new and I've never seen it before. I've tried most of the other vegan milk alternatives and I have yet to find a favourite out of the brands commonly seen (oatly, alpro, etc.) Also, I love the design and aesthetic of the packaging.   I'm not sure if this brand is new , but it's the first time i've ever seen it personally. I've tried homemade and restaurant made lassi before, which I loved, so I really wanted to try this new product to see if it was as good as the ones I've tried. I personally love mango, and I've only had plain lassi before, so I was curious to see what this flavour would taste like. Also, I love that it is lowfat, and has very basic ingredients with no excess preservatives or other obscure ingredients.    1) Joe & the Juice i. Joe & the Juice, all ii. I like the juices because they have a variety of flavours and is freshly blended. I do not like buying smoothies from grocery stores really, because I don't like drinking beverages with a ton of preservatives or oxidised fruit/vegetables.  
 2) Green Juice i. Pret a Manger, Green Juice ii. I love the flavour of the green juice, and it feels more fresh than the ones at the grocery store. 
 3) Smoothies i. Innocent brand, Invigorate Super Smoothie ii. It is more accessible and the taste is good. I like that it has flax seeds inside and a variety of fruit/vegetables.   1) Dried Dates and fruits i. I usually get imported dates when I can find it, and dried fruits from Whole Foods. ii. I like the imported dates because they are more fragrant, larger, and less dry. I like that Whole Foods has a large variety of dried fruit selections, and the quality is always good.  2) Veggie Chips i. Tyrells  or Kettle ii. I like that they are accessible and have a good taste, nicely salted. The Tyrells are my favourite because the vegetables used are actually recognisable (you can actually tell which veg you are eating with each chip/crisp)   Fruit, Drinks, Juice   Oat Milk, New, Coffee   Staple brand, Vegan, Dairy   I like that they have gluten free options and is a new brand to me (not sure if it is but I personally have not seen it before).   Not very compelling. I don't think it caters towards me and I don't think there are very unique flavours or products that different to the ones already on the market. If I'm going to be completely honest I don't really see how it will be compelling to anyone outside of their particular european target audience shown in their advertisements.   I feel a bit uncomfortable seeing things on their feed that are tagged ""gyoza"" and profit off of asian cuisines but it isn't really gyoza at all, and the there's not a single bit about asian culture/representation on the instagram feed/ in advertisements at all. To be very honest it feels like cultural appropriation and like the brand just decided to do a very westernised take off of what they think gyoza is to profit off of an ""exotic"" concept, when honestly it looks much more like polish perogies to me.  In general it just doesn't feel inclusive, and it seems a bit old school. I don't think that there is a huge variety of flavours or types of food that cater to a palette outside of their target audience.   Natural ingredients? ",Harvest,
434393,Alex,Goodman,alex_goodman7@yahoo.com,"I would not go as far to say that this is my favourite photo of myself but it does bring back some very good memories of a really good trip I took with my wife last year. She is also my best friend and I am sure she would say this photo is a good visual description of my personality. I never take things too seriously, I always like to have fun and do stupid things and also have a sense of adventure as we were hiking through the Yorkshire dales when we found this wood carving.

I would like to think that if my wife/best friend had to describe me in one sentence it would be; ""He is a loving and fun guy who cares strongly about some important things but never takes life too seriously."" At least I hope she would say something like that!!  I have gone a little left field with this as I was struggling to think of an object that reflects me as a person (apart from a mirror (sorry)) but this photo was taken at my favourite place, the beach, and I have always lived close to the beach and would never move far away from it. It is somewhere I go when I am happy, somewhere I go when I am sad and somewhere I go when I need to think. I hope this is ok?   I may have taken this a little literally, but this is something that is important to my health but also I like the fact in knowing that I am doing small things to help the environment. I base a lot of my decisions on products I buy about if they are healthy for me and if they are helping reduce my impact on the environment.    This painting is hung in my Living room and it brings me great joy every time I look at it. It was painted for me by my wife and she gave it to me on my 30th Birthday. Again to do with the sea and the beach it brings back great memories and reminds me of her. She is a very good artist!!  So as I have previously mentioned the brand ""Oatly"" who are a company that I really relate to and appreciate. They are doing good in the world, they produce a product that is healthy and is helping reduce the impact on the environment and their branding is fantastic. A company who can give me information about boring things and make me want to read it because of how it is written is a company who have their branding and marketing on point!

Another brand I admire and buy a lot of products from are a very small clothing brand in the town I live in called Poetic Bison. They produce clothing from responsibly sourced materials and plant a tree for every product that they sell. Not only this but their clothing looks good, is very well made and they have excellent marketing on Social media to create a buzz around the ""different"" and ""unique"" parts of their brand.

What I believe a lot of brands are missing is doing more to reduce their carbon footprint and if they are doing this, not having clever enough marketing to get people interested in the fact that they are doing it. I also like companies who are more transparent. We have a small independent supermarket in our town called Hisbe and they again have really funky marketing, they source a lot of their products from local suppliers but also are very transparent on how much they spend out of every £ i spend in their shop with local farmers and producers. This makes me happy knowing that if I spend £30 in their store they are not making huge profits while the producers are making next to nothing. This is the opinion I have on large corporations and supermarkets. Family and Friends - The one thing that makes me happier than anything is having my family and friends around. I have a very small family but that makes them all even more important . I have a very large in law family who all live on the West Coast of America so staying connected with them has been very important this last year.

Food - Something that makes me very happy! I find that eating a health diet makes me happier and since I have stopped eating meat I have found that I felt better and learnt to enjoy a whole host of other foods I had not tried before becoming vegetarian.

Sport and Exercise - Sport is a big part of my life, I am keen golfer and my wife is a professional footballer (as well as an artist, she is horribly talented and makes me look very bad) which means that she loves to get out and practice with me as I used to play at a decent level. The main principle I try to stick to is if something is healthy but also not terrible for the environment. For this reason I am a vegetarian and of course this has a big impact on what I select to eat on a daily basis. 

I am also trying to lose weight (that is not going well) and this affects my decisions on what I select to eat. I try to focus on eating fresh foods which are usually heathier but of course I cannot resist the occasional (or often) pizza.

I do like a lot of the Vegan or Vegetarian meat replacements and often make things like lasagne or Tacos using Quorn mince or a similar brand. This has quite an impact on what I choose to eat on daily basis as often the supermarkets do not stock very much of these products or do not have a large range of different things. The larger supermarkets are getting better and have started to have a number of different brands, but it is more difficult when visiting a smaller supermarket in town as they often have large selections of meat but only 1 or 2 meat alternatives. 

I also have a subscription to Odd Box a weekly delivery of fruit and vegetables that are not deemed good enough to be sold in supermarkets as they are the wrong shape or do not look good enough even though they are perfectly fine. So this will often effect my decision as if I have recently received this delivery I have a number of different things to choose from.  Being a vegetarian Quorn features heavily in my diet and I buy their products because I know they are always quality and they have a very large and diverse range of different products. They are not always the healthiest but the majority of their foods are still healthier than the majorities of meats.   Odd Box are a great brand they are very environmentally friendly and of course everything they deliver is fresh and healthy. They may be other brands that are doing this type of subscription, however they have very good marketing and a bit like Oatly they explain the things they are doing to help the environment in a fun and comedic way.   Another Meat alternative. I really like some of these types of products where they take something delicious that has always traditionally been a meat eaters meal and made it healthier and better for the environment without changing the great flavour or just using beans as an alternative to the meat. Linda McCartney also have a very good brand and produce a number of good things that I like to buy. I do not know much else about their brand though as I do not believe their marketing is that good.  As it often the case one of the biggest challenges is time. Both me and my wife are very busy, we work all day and do not always have the energy or time to make a meal from scratch everyday. That is one of the reasons we do like some of the Linda McCartney meals but we very rarely buy any pre made microwave meals. We do find with the Odd Box deliveries that we often have good fresh vegetables and salads around but again these take time to prepare. As I have mentioned one of my biggest frustrations is that if I walk down to the local small Tesco's or Sainsbury's that they very rarely have a selection of Meat alternatives and we have to make a vegetarian meal from scratch. 

Having a good group of friends around also proves to have it down falls as we are often asked to go out and this does affect my plan to eat healthier. 

We have considered getting a subscription to something like Hello Fresh but I have always been a little worried about how many different meals they can provide that are vegetarian and how this can become quite expensive.  I chose this milkshake drink for healthy convenience because again it had bright colours that drew my attention but also the word Nutrition was in big bold letters which made me think it was going to be healthy. I love chocolate, and this product is an easy ready made chocolate milkshake which made it very convenient. I have bought it and if I like it it may be something I buy more regularly to have after a swim in the mornings as a quick breakfast.   This caught my eye because of the bright packaging, it is not a brand I have ever bought before, but this along side the fact it advertised that it is Fat Free and contains 15g of protein it made me want to try it. It was delicious. The colours are what made me feel like it would bring me joy. I associate the colour with fruit and fruit always makes me happy.   Being a vegetarian I am always looking in the non-diary section for new and interesting products. This caught my eye straight away. I love cheese and I have not stopped eating it despite stopping eating meat. I love camembert and I am really intrigued to see if this lives up to normal camembert. I chose it again as it caught my eye with the bright packaging, it was nice and clear that it was a Non dairy product and the picture on the front helped me instantly realise what the cheese was. Looking forward to trying this one.   This is not a new brand to me. However I have never seen this product before and as soon as I saw it I knew I wanted to try it. They may have been selling it for a while as I very rarely go to the dairy section but I noticed its very distinctive packaging. Despite choosing the other products as their colour stood out to me, it was the distinct lack of colour that drew me in. The branding is instantly recognisable and made me know that I would love this product. Again I bought it and will look forward to trying this.   Again not an easy question as I very rarely buy and drink Smoothies or shakes and when I buy juice it is normally the shops own brand because again I do not often find that more expensive brands produce juice sufficiently better for me to pay the extra money. Again if a particular brand for example Copella is available at a reduced price for a promotion then I will often buy this, as long as the price is much closer to the shops own brand. When it comes to buying apple juice though I do often look out for things like organic apples and I always make sure that the only ingredient is the juice itself and nothing is added. The Nutrition shake that I bought for the last task is something I will buy more of, but again this was very expensive so I will not be buying them often unless they are on sale.   So healthy snacks are something I do enjoy and need to have to hand a lot of the time otherwise I find myself reaching for chocolate. I always look to buy belvita breakfast biscuits and their entire range of different products, like the hazelnut filled soft bakes. These are a particular favourite of mine and I tend to always pick them up when I am in the store. I choose this particular brand as I do not feel like any others come close to producing something as good as this. Also I do not find them to expensive and the more expensive ones (like the soft bakes) are often on sale and I will buy a few of them at the same time. Another healthy snack that I will often turn to are yoghurt coated raisins. These are one of my favourites but again I do not stick to particular brand. Quite often the shops own brands are the ones I buy because they are always good quality and the better known brands are very expensive and do not give me a much better product for the money. If I do buy a branded product it will often be Sun Maid as this is a very well known brand and I have been buying them since I was a kid.   Fresh, fruit, branding   healthy, good for the environment, funny   high quality, expensive, almond milk   I like the colour of the branding the dark blue really catches the eye. I like the fact that the TVC and the Instagram feed give the product a real healthy feeling, the insta feed is not just shots of the products but also very healthy things made with the products. I get the impression that the company may be a small brand that are maybe family owned (this could be completely untrue just a feeling) which I like.   Not particularly, nothing in the advert or the insta feed made me think I want to go and try this product. The dark blue branding may catch my eye in the store but the logo would put me off from buying the product. I did not feel drawn in, although the advert was nice to watch it did not make me think this is a great brand that I am going to want to buy the products of.   I do not like the logo. I feel like it is very old, and in no way a modern brand. I am left a little confused even now after seeing the advert and the insta feed as to what their products actually are. They clearly have some drinks and some breakfast cereals and cereal bars but it is not very clear. Despite perhaps giving the impression of being a healthy product again nothing is telling me this. There is no clear reason for me to want to buy/try this product at the moment.   My impression that this brand stands for a few different products, perhaps more healthy eating products that have been developed by a company in the Nordics. Very little to excite me, nothing to explain about healthy eating, nothing to explain about environmental impact, nothing that made it different. Honestly, it almost made me think of one of the random products that you get at Aldi or Lidl, a brand you have never heard of which produces some good food, but you would never see the product in a Tesco's or a Sainsburys.

198759,Elisabeth ,Dien,elisabeth.dien@gmail.com,"I think my best friend would say that I'm a joyful, smart person with a very big heart. In terms of brands that best embody me as a person, I would have to say Bare Minerals. Because as much as I love Dior and Lancôme products for their qualities, I don't feel drawn at all to the image of women they convey, the glossy, sexy, bling skinny model image. In the past years I've started using much more natural/organic products. My makeup is actually the only area of my life where I still buy conventional products (I buy organic food, hygiene products, cleaning products, skincare, haircare...). I would miss the confidence it brings me just knowing that it's there - that even without using it, I know that if I wake up with a pimple I can cover it, if I haven't slept a little concealer and mascara will make my eyes look rested, if I feel depressed a little lipstick or eyeshadow brings me some color and peps... This is so reassuring and I often tell myself I don't know how men do without it!
I would miss the freedom to reinvent myself myself everyday and choose the ""me"" that I want to present to others. 
I would miss the child-like playfulness. Being an adult, makeup is basically my only occasion to play with brushes and colors, and to paint (even if on myself!) and draw (even if with an eyeliner!) My company has us working from home 100% since March... and probably until June 2021. This is depressing. With a young child at home (and daycare closed for months), and because I work a lot, for me it means that I don't get to go out of the house much, and I have been lacking time to take care of myself... I can clearly feel how if affects my self-confidence and morale. I miss making myself pretty and choosing my clothes and makeup carefully in the morning before leaving the house for work. 
I don't put makeup on if I'm not going out (I feel like it's a good occasion for my skin and lashes to rest and reset...) and it's true that spending so many months at home not wearing makeup anymore, have taught me to appreciate myself more and be more comfortable with my bare skin and lashes... For me it's especially mascara. I would have NEVER gone to work without wearing mascara. I even had an emergency spare one in my desk drawer at work in the rare cases I would forget putting some on in the morning, because I could not have spent a whole day without it. I thought it made me look tired and dull when not wearing it. But now I do Video conference calls with my colleagues every day without any makeup on. I do feel like VCs are different though. I'm not sure I would do it in real life. 
And on the rare occasions when I do go-out, I'm wearing even more makeup because it has become like a rare luxury pleasure to put some on... I think the brand that excites me the most in the luxury make-up space is Oh my Cream, because it combines my strong belief in clean beauty, and my attraction to luxury, beautiful, quality products that don't neglect sensoriality. I love that their approach is consistent and holistic, that they provide a lot of content/ advice  through newsletters and social media posts... I feel like it's a brand with values that match mine (best effort, pragmatism, ethics) and as I get older I feel like it's more and more important to me. They made me discover Kjaer Weis (my current blush) and Ilia. a. Well first, I really don't like the idea of having a guru anymore... I feel like, at almost 36 yo, the only person I need to listen to is myself. Following gurus is a concept that appealed to me when I was maybe 22-23yo and felt like I needed to be inspired and learn from qualified people. I used to follow a lot of makeup blogs 10 years ago - I don't even know if they exist anymore and struggle to remember the names... I remember Beauté blog, Mon blog de fille, Cynthia Dulude, Garance Doré, Le blog de la méchante... Actually I just realized that I was following a lot of blogs when iGoogle still existed, but as I never found a good platform to replace it when it got sunset, I've progressively stopped to go check them... What I loved most about these ""gurus"" was learning the techniques. I felt like watching the tutorials was like taking a masterclass in makeup. And the ""pro tips"". Which brush to use for what... My mom never put any makeup on so I had to get my education somewhere!
b. What I hate about them is the consumerism pushed by the business... Growing older, I'm more and more in a downsizing, minimalist mindset... I care about the ecology and don't want to consume too much plastic. I feel bad when buying a lot of products that I'm barely going to use... I'm all about recycling and refillable packages (love Kjaer Weis for that, although the packagings are too heavy to be carried around, they have to stay home) and buying good quality, long-lasting products. I feel like ""influencers"" 10 years ago were maybe a bit more authentic, they were opening the door to their real life for you to get a sneak peek. Now you feel that it's a business, they receive cartons of new products everyday, try something new everyday, don't even have time to create a routine for themselves and see what's good on the long run as they have to test new things all the time. You end up not trusting them...  For me they need to be authentic, have a strong point of view (which makes them inspiring) and match my values.   I think an influencer for me is a kind of ambassador, they basically advertise products differently but it's the same goal as traditional media. The guru probably has a whole lifestyle and personnality that appeal to me, they can talk about many different products or things and it's still interesting to me because I'm interested in who they are, in their life.   I heard about this Kjaer Weis cream blush through an Instragram story from Mathilde Lacombe.   She was saying how she wouldn't use cream blush before, but it actually looked much more natural than powder. It made me want to try it, as I was finishing my current blush and had always used powder, not cream. Also the fact that it was a clean product and in a refillable packaging matched my current expectations.   She demonstrated how it looks on her, and how she was using it, and it convinced me that it was easy to use  and looked very natural and fresh on her indeed. I always thought cream blushes were too heavy but she showed it was not the case at all.   Yes she showed how little she was using, and how she was tapping her fingers very lightly on the skin to apply it. I think if I hadn't seen that I wouldn't have bought a cream blush as I was usually buying powder, and she taught me how to use it. I think I would have put too much on if I hadn't seen that.   Always been into nude looks, minimal make up. Making me look fresh and confident, but not necessarily very noticeable. Or when I go out, I usually do a smokey eye.    Mathilde Lacombe is a great example of nude looks.  I think I learnt how to master the smokey eye on Beauté blog.    The influencer on Beauté Blog gave a great tip that I hadn't seen elsewhere on how to do the smokey eye: she said you have to first use a pencil that's quite greasy, before putting on the powder. And I really felt it was doing the trick much better, achieving a much better look, and it prevents the smokey from budging.   Tutorials that show you step by step, show you the technique and the right gestures.    A bit like for the couture world, it brings some inspiration, some boldness, some innovation to the world of makeup. More or less depending on the brand. For example, it's funny that I always liked Dior makeup, but didn't really pay attention to who's behind it, and Peter Philips was actually the makeup artist matching more my taste and universe from the ones you asked about; whereas I was never so interested in Chanel as a brand that I always found a bit boring and outdated, and Lucia Pica's universe  on Instagram was also exactly that for me.   I don't really have a ""wow"" example in mind. But I tend to appreciate Dita Von Teese collaborations with brands, whether it's with lingerie brands or makeup (I think she did one with M.A.C a few years ago?). I guess what I like is that she has a strong personality and visual universe, she is a statement, so she does bring something to the brand. She's not expert of the lingerie of the makeup, but the collab makes sense because she has a strong taste that she infuses in the collection. What doesn't really work for me with makeup artists like Peter Philips or Lucia Pica is that they're actually makeup experts collaborating with a makeup brand, I don't know anything about who they are or their personality outside of makeup, so I'm not really able to see what they're bringinf to the brand, what's theirs, and what's the brand's.   I guess it makes Chanel a bit younger and more actual ? Not sure. As you gathered, I'm not a huge fan.   Personal relevance. It just doesn't speak much to me. I did watch the video you linked above, and it sounded a bit dull, a bit snobbish, outside of my world. We're all stuck at home and anxious in what seems to be most dire year of all times, and Lucia Pica tells us about how amazing the shimmering of piles of precious stones in Namibia is... Do you see what I mean? It's all that I don't like about luxury, sometimes it can be so disconnected from the actual world...   Hard to answer, I didn't know Peter Philips before so I'm not very familiar with the partnership.   I guess he brings some art, some vision, some boldness to the brand.   I don't know much about it so not sure how to answer.  I'm sure Lucia Pica is a great girl with a lot to say, I'd love to get to know her more, and I don't mean only how she designs and uses Chanel products, but how she lives, how she thinks. I guess she doesn't use ONLY Chanel products for herself ? Getting to know her more would get me to trust her more, and eventually I could trust how she talks about Chanel more; because right now I don't know how much of the proposition is from Chanel, and how much is from her. I don't feel familiar enough.",Guru,
399150,Kaoru,Ro,kaoruro0812@gmail.com,"I am a Japanese Chinese who is going to college in America. I would say it's the Armani Beauty because I think the most important part for make up is foundation. Foundation will set my whole make-up look and will also get me ready for myself. It covers my flaw and makes my advantage stand out. It gives me confidence and makes my love myself more. Also, I love Armani's lipsticks, which is also an important step in my make-up routine. Without lipsticks, I will look pale and dim, thus lipsticks will make me more glamorous and confident in myself. Therefore, with their foundation and lipsticks, Armani Beauty have embodied me as a more confident and self-loving person. I think I will miss the process of doing make-up because I really enjoy the process of doing make-up every morning when I wake up. This process is not just doing make-up in order to become pretty; it is the process of refreshing myself. That refreshing just gives me confidence. I think since the COVID-19 has started to spread in the U.S., I rarely go out except for groceries, so I would not do make-up anymore if I am not going out. Even if I am going out for groceries, I also rarely do make-up because I have to wear masks anyways and masks will cover my make-up and also ruin my make-up by covering it. And because I do not do make-up often anymore during COVID-19 outbreak, I started to miss make-up a lot. As I mentioned before, I really missed the process of doing make-up -- the process of refreshing myself. I also started to realize the important role make-up plays in my life since it's been missing in my life in 2020 a lot. And because I miss make-up a lot, I started to record my own make-up vlogs even though that has not been edited yet and posted in anywhere yet but just by doing so makes me really happy and satisfying. I think watching Vogue Beauty Secret videos on YouTube really inspired me a lot. I used to follow more like an Asian or specifically Korean make-up style before, but after watching many celebrities and influencers doing their make-up in the Vogue Beauty Secret videos on YouTube, I started to follow some of the European or American make-up looks now. For example, I used to like drawing my eyebrow straight and dying my eyebrow to brown color that might not be really natural ""me"". However, after watching the Vogue Beauty Secret, I started to realize the importance of finding your own make-up and keeping it as natural as possible. Therefore, I started to draw my eyebrow more naturally with black eyebrow pencil and with natural technique to make my eyebrows look natural like I did not do make-up. I think I do not look at a specific person's make-up tutorial videos anymore but I focus more on the make-up itself now. If anyone did a good make-up, I would look at their videos and follow them especially the Vogue Beauty Secret I mentioned earlier. But I used to very like Iris (IbabeeeIris) and Kylie Jenner's make-up tutorials. I think Kylie is someone who taught me how to use lip pencil to shape my lip shape and Iris taught me how to make my make-up natural. Both of them recommended my a lot of good make-up products. For Kylie, it might just be her own products -- Kylie Cosmetics, but it turned out that her lip pencil only works for her but not me. However, for Iris, since she is also Chinese, her recommendation was much more helpful. She recommended me the Chanel eyeshadow, Tom Ford perfume, and a lot of other stuff that might not be luxury brands. Therefore, I think it is better to follow make-up gurus who are more like me just like Iris, not someone who is really different from me like Kylie in this case.  I definitely think that make-up gurus should be someone who have their own styles of make-up and they are good at their own styles. And they usually have more experience and knowledge about different make-up brands and products than the public. Most of the make-up gurus also have tons of make-up products that make me want to be like them.   I think they definitely have more make-up knowledge and techniques that they can teach or show to the audience. They also focus more on their make-up looks and product recommendations instead of other elements. They shoot make-up tutorial, make-up product recommendation, and other videos that are related to make-ups. In my opinion, they usually treat make-up like painting and drawing. They can create make-up looks that others cannot like Halloween special looks or Christmas special looks. They are also sensitive to colors being used on their make-ups so that they can match them well. For example, they know which eye shadow color goes well with other ones so that you don't look like a ""panda"" or a ""ghost"". They are also good at creating new looks and being innovative in it.   As I mentioned before, I got recommended by my favorite make-up guru Iris (IbabeeeIris).   This is really easy to carry especially for traveling. Also, I usually only use 2-3 colors for my eyeshadow looks so I would waste many colors in a plate if the plate has many colors. But for this Chanel one, all of the four colors in the plate exactly fulfill my needs for my eyeshadow look. I used the lighter ones to draw my eyeshadows and the darkest for eyeliner.   I think I was motivated after she used the eyeshadows herself and she said everything I mentioned above that it is so small and good for traveling and she also thinks the four colors are all so useful and easy to handle. I felt like she really persuaded me by these points and since I also want to make my make-up more natural like Iris, I wanted to buy brown eyeshadow plates, so I decided to buy the Chanel eyeshadow plate.   I think she also recommended me a lot of products like the Fenty Beauty concealer brush, Tom Ford Perfume, and specific Chanel lipsticks. She also taught me a useful and easy eyeshadow technique that I still use it now, which is to place the lightest color like white or beige as the base, the second lighter color like light brown, light orange, light pink in the front part of my eyes, and the darker color like medium brown in the back part of my eyes and blend the darker one with the lighter one well in the middle. This is so useful that I use this technique for every color plates now.   I don't have a specific make-up look that I like. I just want to be natural and make people think like ""I did not do make-up.""   I think it is definitely Iris who inspired me.   For example, the eye shadow tip I mentioned before is an important step for a natural look especially use brown colors that Iris recommended. Another one would be eyebrow and I didn't specifically learned it from any specific person but I just searched ""natural brow look"" in Chinese in the Little Red Book and there were tons of tutorials and I learned from many of the tutorials including buying the Shu Uemura eyebrow pencil and trying to draw the front part vertically like real eyebrow and make the bottom part as clear as possible. Kylie Jenner also taught me to draw lip line to make my lip more stand out and have a clearer shape.   I think it is definitely through watching different YouTube videos especially the Vogue Beauty Secret. One tiny tip might gives me inspiration. Also, I like to learn about new tips and techniques in the Little Red Book because it is like a make-up ""solution"" for asians. I enjoy looking at YouTube videos especially the Vogue Beauty Secret because I feel like lots of the celebrities on the Vogue Beauty Secret also pursue a natural look and that strengthened my desire to make my make-up as natural as possible. Many of the steps that the celebrities take for their make-up looks are simple and healthy that they are trying to use make-up products that are not necessarily expensive but have good and nutritious materials in them. It really inspires me to focus on the healthy side of make-up while also maintaining a natural look.   I think for Lucia Pia, I feel more like looking at a commercial with some elegance especially with their videos while for Charlotte Tilbury, I think it is more friendly especially with their ""tutorial"" kind of videos. I would definitely prefer a tutorial kind of promotion than a high-end commercial. For Mao Geping, I actually watched his collaboration video with Teacher Xu, also a famous Chinese micro influencer, but I think his space is also not as attractive as Charlotte Tilbury's one except for the collaboration video since he is not so good looking and funny but just teaching make-up techniques and looks. For Peter Philips, I think it is just too artistic to me that I feel like he is doing art but make-up.   I think the partnerships between star make-up artists and luxury brands definitely add proficiency and innovation to the world of make-up because this partnership is like a pro collaborating with pro, which they will be really creative and can generate some sparks between them. Moreover, this partnership will definitely also create a even higher sense of prestige to both the brand and the make-up artist because only high quality star make-up artists can collaborate with luxury brands while only famous luxury brands can partner with star make-up artists.   I cannot think of any because I really do not know there is a famous collaboration between a star make-up artist and a luxury make-up brand. I have never heard of any.   I think this collaboration indeed adds the sense of prestige and profession to Chanel. It also made me feel ""wow"" again to Chanel because it is really something that I would never thought of and maybe lots of other brands and make-up artists would not thought of as well. I think it is because both Chanel and Lucia view make-up in a different and unique way as we do. They are depicting and portraying the world with make-up and only professionals can make that come true.   I think something that would be interesting and meaningful to add in this collaboration is to show the process of making that eyeshadow plates. For example, how each eyeshadow colors were inspired from each colors of the deserts.   To be honest, this wasn't as unique as the collaboration between Lucia and Chanel. For, this might be just a normal high-end fashion show look because I feel like I see this kind of make-up all the time when I watch different shows in the fashion week. However, after listening to Peter explaining the meaning of the make-up, I was more clear with the make-up and admired how he empowered women through his eye make-up. The fact that he is delivering a message with this strong emphasis on eyes while make everything else natural made me think that this partnership is somewhat unique.   I think this collaboration also added profession to the Christian Dior brand, but maybe a lack of prestige in my opinion. However, this collaboration did make me feel like Dior is an inclusive brand where they empower women and ask for gender equality through their make-up collaboration with Peter.   I feel like this collaboration can be more interesting if they can show the theme of empowering women more explicitly because I feel like they did not really focus too much on this theme. They were more like showing the make-up and the models and that was kind of making me feeling like ""themeless"".  One piece of advice might be to make their make-up closer to our lives. Lots of their make-up might be used for celebrities shooting for a photo shoot or models to walk in the fashion week, which has less interaction with the public. If they can show that their make-up can also be something creative and inspirational in real life especially for casual looks, then it will be even more appealing for make-up enthusiasts like me.",Guru,
399151,Ashley ,Yang,ashleyniyang@gmail.com,"A super fun, loud and sociable person who's lived everywhere. I love Fenty and Mac because these two brands embody me as a person because they offer a broad range of products that allow me to create different looks that make me feel confident. In particular, as pale skin tone is most common in Asia, it is hard to find dark shades foundation. However, Mac and Fenty both have diverse colour palettes for all kind of skin shades, which make my life much easier. At the same time, these two brands' brand identity embodies boldness and fierce which I love. I would definitely miss my MAC Studiofix Complete Coverage Cushion Compact. It is the one and only item I can't live without as I like having flawless looking skin even without any other make-up on. I love the MAC cushion because it gives the best coverage yet it is not too thick, making the skin looking smooth and naturally healthy. This year has been quite different in so many ways. To start with, I went through a fourteen-day quarantine when I left London to come back to China. During the time that I spent in the quarantine hotel, I still put on a bit of make-up each day to maintain my daily routine. It really helped me with my mental state during that time. In terms of trend, I've recently adopted the technique of baking. It is very helpful because I have quite an oily T-zone and baking helps me to stay fresh for the entire day. As for style, I watched Euphoria during quarantine and the show really inspired me with all the characters' set make-up, especially the character Alex's looks. a. I love PONY Syndrome on Youtube is my make-up gurus. I love her because her techniques are intricate and she puts on all kinds of looks for different occasions. 
b. I can't think of any.  A make-up guru is someone who knows their techniques and products extremely well, and is able to elaborate/deliver the knowledge to their audiences in an easily  understandable approach.   Make-up gurus probably have more understanding not only in what products are suitable for themselves but other people. I think they have the knowledge in different skin types, facial structures, colour tones.... and knowing how to put make-up on different faces.    I heard about this product from a Chinese make-up artist on Youtube called 方方FANTASIA. I was searching the proper technique of baking and his youtube channel popped up and he introduced Laura Mercier's translucent powder.   I was excited to gain the knowledge of how to bake while knowing that a trusted brand such as Laura Mercier has suitable product for me.   He simply put the product on while explaining what baking is and the pros and cons of baking. The  youtube video has really goof quality so that I could see the difference before and after he baked with the powder. This is a great way of validating a product.   Baking   My favourite make-up look at the moment is using coloured eyeliner to draw thick lines over a contrasted eye shadow.   I watched Euphoria during my quarantine and the set make-ups in the show really inspires me to play around with colours. Then I watched tutorial of Euphoria’s Alexa Demie doing her own make up to learn.   Practice is the best way to learn. I would watch the make-up tutorial video while putting on my make-up so I'm doing it step by step as the YouTuber/guru. The best way of putting make-up on is to have a good base - by all means, make sure the skin is smooth and well-preped before putting on foundation. I usually put a mask(Skin Ceuticals Phyto Corrective Masque) on for 15 minutes before putting my make-up on.   I like looking at Pinterest and Youtube to find different inspirations for new looks.  Looking at Pinterest for make-up photos always gives me different ideas and then I will  search up the technique on Youtube to learn how to put it on my face.   Artistically inspired, commercial and high-fashion   In my opinion, collaboration as such gives more insights and depth to the world of  make-up. Because star make-up artists are professionals who understand both the audiences and the brands, they are able to connect the two with their expertise in make-up and reach of audiences.   Mario Dedivanovic's collaboration with Sephora this year was quite impressive.   Pica is known to be unconventional yet practical with the looks she creates. Her work is imaginative and wild, but still wearable and effortless and it has become the signature of Chanel's cosmetic line.   Nothing really. I think its quite an extraordinary partnership.    Before landing at Dior, Peter Philips previously helmed Chanel’s beauty division. He’s known for  using colour and materials in mind-blowingly different ways. His collaboration with Dior really revoked the conventional aesthetic that Dior's makeup line used to be.   More excitement and energy.    Not really. Because I think Philips has experience working for different fashion houses and he understand each brand's attributes. It gives him a better perspective when joining Dior.  Sometimes I think Chanel is playing too safe and always gives me the impression of being overly classic and traditional, so I would suggest that the brand could add more diversity and excitement to its makeup lines in order to boost new ideas and trends.",Guru,
399148,Pauline ,Lefort,pauline.lefort.carrier@gmail.com,"In one sentence, my best friend would say about me that I am a creative, enthusiastic and funny person who loves beauty, fashion, estheticism and travels. I think that the brand that embodies me the best as a person would be Yves Saint Laurent: it represents elegance but also simplicity. The shapes of the packagings are quite simple, but with little details that make the difference. For instance with the ""Volupté Liquid Color Balm"", the packaging is simple but efficient, with a touch of originality: the pink ring and the lips at the bottom. It has a fun side and I find myself in this ""fun"" or ""different"" touch. Luxury, but not too serious. What I would miss the most would be making me up before going to work or before going to a soirée. It would be terrible for me because I love this ""transformation"" moment. First, it is a moment with me and for me. It is a moment when I look after me and I make myself beautiful. And I love the fact that when I look at me in the mirror I really like myself.

In terms of products, if I had to choose one product that I couldn't live without, it would be foundation. I trust my eyes and my lips, they can go out ""naked"", but I don't trust my skin as I think it is never perfect, and I love having a perfect foundation. It would be very hard for me not to have foundation anymore and not to be able to hide the little flaws of my skin. And when I think of it, the second product would be mascara as it really helps to make my glance and my eyes more pronounced. Finally, the third product would be lipstick. This trio is a must. I think my relationship to make-up has slightly changed in 2020. Actually I think it changed a bit, yes, because of the mask that we have to wear and because of the new measures asked by the governments (curfew, and small gathering, which means a poor night life and then, less make-up), but it DIDN'T change a lot.

Indeed, I wear less lipstick, because people can't see it anymore when I wear my mask, but I still wear it sometimes, when I have important meetings during which I know I will be able to take my mask off, or when I go to the restaurant with my boyfriend, and even when I go to small gatherings with my friends. For me it is a real pleasure to wear lipstick and even the fact that applying it on my lips makes me feel good. 

Regarding my eyes, I don't wear more makeup than before. Just the same. However, I think that now it is more important than ever to have perfect eyebrow. I am then thinking of making their shape better and making in them up in a better way. This does not mean I do it already. I'm just thinking of it for now, but I think I should do something about it. 

Finally, regarding my foundation, I keep wearing it every day, even on the chin. Indeed, as I said before, I still take my mask off sometimes during the day and then I need to have a good foundation during these ""free face"" moments. In the world of makeup and beauty, one trend really called me out: responsible products. I know natural beauty exists for a long time already, but it seems to get bigger and bigger, and I think it is a must for all beauty brands nowadays. Some brands used to focus on natural formula. But today, it is not about the formula only, it is about the entire product. I noted that many brands work on upcycling, durability and eco-conception and I think it is for the best! I am really happy and thrilled to see the world changing in a good way. a. What I love about make-up gurus: 
they are makeup experts, I can trust them, they know a lot about the products and how tu use them, they know many different brands and make me discovering new products and new brands, they inspire me in the way they use the products

b. What I hate about make-up gurus: 
I am not a big fan of influencers that focus on make-up only. Even if I love makeup, I am not a makeup artist and this is why I need to see other things, such a fashion, lifestyle, interior design... Sometimes makeup gurus can give the feeling that they are a bit fake: too much makeup is not nice. Sometimes I also have the feeling that they forget about what is really important in life (family, happiness, health, friends, balance). As an example, I would like to speak about my cousin @agiewonderland. I would say that she is a ""junior makeup guru"". I say that she is a ""junior"" because she just started her activity as an instagram makeup influencer. She posts everyday about her new makeup looks and the new products that she buys and she loves. I know her personally and I know she is very smart and a deep person. But if I didn't know her, I could quickly think that she is very superficial and that her only concern in life is makeup. 

When I completed the enrollment form, I spoke about @KleoBeaute about one of the influencer I like. I think she is great because even if she focuses on beauty products only, her content is amazing: very high quality pictures, very interesting captions with explanations on the products and tips on how to use it. For me, she is a real professional.  For me a make-up guru is a person who knows make-up very well and is passionate about it. It is an influencer (instagrammer, blogger and/or youtuber). The make-up guru can be an make-up artist too, but not necessarily. They exclusively post and speak about beauty and specifically makeup. They know how to use make-up the best way, they are really creative, they have an eye for aestheticism. They give tips on how to use the different products. They do some videos, tutorials, swatches... They speak about the shades, the texture, the finish, they say what they feel when they wear the different products (is it pleasant? is it soft?). They also present the new launches and speak about trends.   I think that the difference is that they speak and focus on make-up only. They also create some looks that we can reproduce and do at home. 
A contrario, the 'basic influencers' are more generalist. They are not make-up specialists and don't know everything about make-up. They don't have a real strong passion about make-up.   I first heard about the product through brand promotional campaign and because we bought it at work as a benchmark. And then, the fashion and beauty influencer I really like @emiliebrunette, spoke about it in her story. Then I was like ""wow she wears it and she likes it, it must be a great product!""   What excited me about the product is the fact that she said she really liked it, and that it was the one and only mascara she uses on a daily basis, her favorite one. And this product actually really does very long and dense lashes.   Actually, the simple fact that @emiliebrunette spoke about the product and said that she was wearing it made me think that I should buy it. I remember she spoke about it in a story about her make-up essentials, and which products she was currently using on a daily basis. 

In this story, she had magnificent lashes and I was wondering which mascara she was wearing. And going further in the story, she spoke about the mascara because one of the follower asked her with a private message what she was wearing on her lashes. She said ""many of you asked me what mascara I use, and it is the BadGal Band by Benefit"". Then I was very impressed but also happy because I knew then which magic product she was wearing!   She spoke about the benefits she looks for with mascaras in general (length and density) and said that this mascara was perfectly meeting her expectations and what she looks for in a mascara.   At the moment, I really like the ""glowy foundation look"". It is a look very natural and fresh, which gives a very nice glow to my skin. I look healthy, fresh, shiny thanks to this look. It is a feel good look! 

   I first heard about this look on Clarins France instagram account @clarinsfr. Actually, this look was made my Magali Marx. Magali is a make-up artist and training manager (retail education) at Clarins. She often posts tutorials, either on her personal instagram account @magalimarx.pro or on @clarinsfrance account. Magali definitely inspired me with this look.   The video I watched was really clear and easy to follow. We see the different steps with the different products and accessories to use. Firstly, the foundation: use a liquid foundation mixed with a primer, and to apply that, use a large brush. Secondly, use a powder, on the T zone (very interesting to know on which zone we have to apply the different products). Thirdly, use the highlighter ""Clarins Glow to Go"". I really like the fact that we clearly see how she uses the products and how she applies them on the skin.   The content I like the most is video, and particularly short videos, or videos with step. I love watching videos without a speaking voice but with music. I don't really like listening to the makeup artist saying what he/she does. As we have the images, no need to have the speaking. But it's really good to have the step written in a synthesized way. I enjoy watching those videos because they are beautiful. I like seeing the before, the evolution, and the after, the final result. I really enjoy those step by step videos.    I think these partnerships give credibility to the makeup brand and vice versa. They add a very creative and intellectual side to the world of makeup, which can be perceived sometimes as superficial or commercial oriented. I think star make-up artists rise the value of a makeup brand.   I really enjoyed the collaboration between Lucia Pica and Chanel for the Spring Summer 2018 Collection. I actually discovered Lucia Pica for the first time with this collection. I really enjoyed the fact that she explained in a video all her inspirations, from where this collection was coming from, and why she developed this collection. I loved the colors shed used in the makeup collection, but also all the digital visuals produced for it. Everything was beautiful: the harmony in the colors, the texts used in the caption, the emails... and I loved the idea of travel and holidays in Italy that we could see in each creative visual or video.    The collaboration between Lucia Pica and CHANEL adds some substance to the brand. It makes the brand more intellectual, rich and artistic. It also gives Chanel makeup brand a real credibility into the beauty world, even though Chanel is a fashion brand originally.   In the YouTube video, I was a bit frustrated not to see the products: the makeup collection developed after the travel in Namibia. I really like the videos of Lucia and Kristen Stewart, because we see a real link between the makeup artist and the fashion muse of the brand. I think I would really enjoy seeing Lucia Pica in more fashion shows, doing the makeup of the models. I would also enjoy seeing Lucia Pica with Chanel fashion director. I think what is missing in Chanel IG account @chanel.beauty is the real world. I would like to see more backstage pictures.   In this partnership, we clearly see that Peter Philips is definitely into beauty, but also into fashion. It seems that one can't live without the other. When I see Peter Philips instagram account, I find a strong link with fashion: today and before. I feel Dior's legacy.   For me Peter Philips has a touch of craziness in his artistic productions, and I think the collaboration between Peter Philips and Dior brings this modern and crazy artistic touch to a classical and statutory brand.   To make this collaboration more interesting and meaningful I think the brand could ad some collaterals related to the inspiration's journey of Peter Philips. Did he take his inspiration in a city, some kind of flowers, an epoch or maybe abstracts shapes...? Where does the collections and the different looks come from?  I think it would be great to see Lucia Pica doing the makeup of the models at Chanel fashion shows. Another thing that would enthusiast me would be seing Lucia Pica using the products for herself. Trying new looks on herself and explaining how to do it, just as normal makeup gurus do :) We see her as a professional and not as an accessible person. It would be great to get some advice directly from her!",Guru,

- Natasha denona
- Charlotte Tilbury
- Hourglass
- Glossier
- ere perez cosmetics
- Becca Cosmetics I would miss miss the mascara from glossier 
Because of the mascara gave me the Curls and sculpts as it lengthens, creating a natural “baby extension” effect without clumping. Relationship to make-up and the role it plays in your life has changed in 2020:
I started to make up when i was 15, that moment i was just doing this to try to get a bf, at 2020, i do that just for please myself not for anyone anymore.
Make up in my life is always important and it always been my life safer. Now days, minimal or simply style is on and on, even on the make up trend and the packaging design.
Glossier is the first brand that inspired me in this part and after all Hourglass is like a extension to keep this style in a Luxury style. Make-up gurus, what I love about them. [ they can give us a lot of tips on make up. We can learn the make up tips and skill from them]
Make-up gurus, what I hate about them. [ too many dramas and the review could be just a lie because of they took the money from the brand to say good things only]  What qualifies these people as makeup gurus?  
For me at least they have a very nice skin first, that to tell me they take care there skins very well, a part of that, i do care about creativity and good makeup skills and the to makes me consider as a make up guru, t   Basic influencers should have basic or advance Knowledge on beauty, Second they need to know how to do a make up very nice, third, they must keep on track to the latest cosmetics or makeup trend.  
   To be honest, i lost my phone so i lost the images i took before, so this is the image i took from internet. 
The specific product for me to bought as a luxury product is Fenty Beauty Trophy Wife highlighter. That moment I heard about it Rihanna is going to launch her own makeup brand, but i thought this brand is just like her toy won't be serious, until i watched one of the guru's review, i decided to buy it.   I am excited on the pigmentations and the colour.  
Its really rare to see there is a gold highlighter in the market.   The Make-up guru presented from doing the swatches, after that they tried it on the face, and even show how to use with this difficult color.   Yes, they used this highlighter not only using as a highlighter only, they even show this could be eyeshadow and for natural make up too.   Natural make up is my favourite at the moment.   She might not the first one to make me heard about natural style, but she did inspired me, she is Daisy Jelley. Her make up is simple and clean, in the same time is chic too.   ""How it works"" to create this?
Techniques doesn't need much as i like simple make up.  But products is really important, like to do the perfect lashes, perfect eyeliner. 
For this two, I recommend mascara from Glossier, eyeliner from Fenty.   When there is a new product launch with some crazy colors, then its time for me to learning some new looks.  I like to learn and fit with different parties specially for theme parties.   I think they look grand, high fashion and artistic.   In my point of view. Partnerships between star make-up artists and luxury brands is always the role who is leading the trend of makeup on global. They might be not as colourful as what does the beauty guru does, but they always have the best products to fit with all the faces and style. With the star make-up artist, even show the fixability and possibility with different style of faces could become how beautiful they are after using those makeup.  Not Like the gurus , the make up they created on Youtube is only good looking on themselves only.   I guess it's Hung Vanngo. Saw he collaborate or working with CK and did one of the AD just look very nice. http://www.hungvanngo.com/3/615/0/ http://www.hungvanngo.com/3/614/0/ 
 Hung Vanngo is the king of makeup . Firstly, his client list is insane - think, Gigi Hadid, Selena Gomez and Katy Perry. Secondly, each and every makeup look he creates is unique and breathtakingly beautiful which makes me want to try on my face.   CHANEL is a very elegant brand, Lucia Pica her makeup is simple but unique. When it max together it looks very good and fit with CHANEL perfectly.   There is nothing missing for me, to be honest i like the style.   Based on the style this Year of Dior, its very nice and the makeup are so retro.   I can tell Peter Philips his makeup always got inspired from the 50-70's according from his instagram. It feel so well for these few years of clothing design on Christian Dior. With his makeup it bring the retro vibes stronger.   Nothing miss for me in this part,. I Like his style as well.  Can you do some videos with tips on single products or some makeup theme. to the publics that even we are not professional but still can do the same makeup like you did to the models perfectly? Not only on the white people, maybe to present on yellow & black too? Will it look like the same or just for specific ethnicity？

If i were them i will try to proposal usage on different ethnicity.",Guru,
334985,Mary ,Scinto,marytscinto@gmail.com,"one in a million, the party never ends with you. That's tough, because I don't know if truly feel aligned with an entire brand and every product, and feel aligned with specific products. Tom ford & Givenchy lip stick. Nars Bronzer and blush. Urban Decay eye shadow. Laura Mercier foundation. Gucci liquid brightener. Bobbi Brown shimmer. I think part of using make up is having a collection of various brands with specific products that fit you, and embody how you feel beautiful. I've never been one to own an entire line within one company. I may love a blush and hate their eye liner. I think that there are plenty of brands that perhaps have it all, just by nature of liking to try new things and experiment I've never been a single brand kinda girl. I think above all I love my Tom Ford & Givenchy lip sticks so perhaps that's the brand I must call my own. I also don't think that I am super engaged with the branding aspect, I love the simplicity and artisan nature of make up design- in a way that the product design and packaging for a lot of brands actually is similar and minimalist, at times it's less minimal and a work of art in itself which can make me feel connected to it- yet I haven't really been swayed by the branding and ethos as much as I have found excitement in holding a product that is beautiful to see and makes me feel beautiful to use. I would miss the ability to make myself feel like I glow. I think that I would survive, I love to use make up and feel like I somehow have transformed my inner self and empowered me to feel a way that I didn't feel without it. Yes you can call it beautiful, but it's almost like a magical thing because you are still you, you still look like you, but you feel like you glow- as if a new light from within is lite when you applied this external thing. I wore make up hardly at all, and when I put on lip stick and make up I suddenly felt like a new woman. When you have no where to go and the world is crumbling, somewhat superficial things like applying make up seem to escape the need of day to day. And your face is covered in a mask. I guess this has almost made us all, or many of us feel like we need it less and less, as the non life or death parts of our day to day have plummeted in importance. However I will say that wearing make up for the first time, a full face, to a friends engagement last week, I was a bit concerned I applied a face appearing like I was going clubbing as a opposed to being in a back yard with a piano playing before the sunset. Part of this entire shift in our lives also made me forgot how it felt to wear make and feel pretty in that way, while it almost made me more insecure in some senses as I sort of forgot what I was supposed to do- as we have all in some ways lost touch with the innate ability to function socially. To be completely honest, I haven't seen anything SUPER recently as I have been nose to the grind in making art and avoiding the media unless it's essential. I did watch a documentary on kylie's make up brand which I am not sure if we'd call luxury and it sort of made me feel sick how much it was promoting this sense of insecurity for people rather than empowerment of this ideal image. I am actually really drawn to the make up campaigns that I have crossed boundaries of gender and created this essence of beauty for everyone. I am a pretty classic kind of person in many ways, so trends are often lost on me. I will say I ADORE the lipstick and idea of products that *change* for your skin tone, as if they are designed for you but really they're designed for everyone and then become personalized in use. I can't remember the brand,   I want to say it was * high end* but more on the *want to be eco-friendly organic rooted * Another trend I am here for is no harm on animals, and no toxic chemicals // garbage for your skin in the product. I do have a sensitive issue though to promoting that things are non-toxic when they actually aren't and it's used as a branding move. As I said in the application portion, the  gurus I have had are friends who follow the gurus or main stream and than share their secrets with me. What I love most is that it's not so serious, it's a friend and their knowledge base and passion is there, but I obviously don't feel like they're trying to sell me something like a brand representative or influencer. What inspires me is their ability to make me feel like I can do the same as they can, with a few new strokes of a brush or steps in application. I think a lot of people who don't know how to apply make up or are uncertain with what colors or other products might be good for the are afraid to explore, and that's no fun at all. I am grateful I live in a city where excess and celebration of life + beauty is so common, New Orleans is full of parties and parades and costumes, and times to dress up and make up & look a whole nwe kind of way- so that too is what I love about my * gurus* that they will hear my vision or an idea, and add to it themselves so that we can execute whatever kind of look we are going for- I think i hate a lot of influencers in general because the feel fake and are just selling you products, so perhaps that's why I haven't fallen in love with any kind of make up guru out there, and it sometimes can seem that make up which people are obsessed with in a way, like can't live with out, need a full face every single day, becomes a turn off to people who may feel that kind of obsession dismisses a passion for the underlying desire for beauty and is disempowering.  As mentioned before, the people i look up to as make up gurus are not exactly professional, but what they have a sense of confidence and play with make up- that they can help you create the best look for you.   What sets the people I look up to apart is their authentic passion for what they are doing, it's not about selling a product or convincing me to look at certain way or pushing a brand- they're passionate about beauty and make up and that is experienced when shared. - it isn't oppressive it's inviting, comforting, and above all inspiring   A friend of mine told me about this bobbi brown concealer stick   That it was PERFECT to bringing with you, didn't require additional brushes, stayed safe and didn't explode in a bag, went on super silky smooth.   She used it all the time, and for different reasons, it was like an ever present addition to her when getting ready to go out, or needing a touch up during the night, she swore buy, said it was the best make up she spent her money on, and used it so much it was worth it/ lasted   that it didn't get broken/ messed up in a bag on the go- // protective packaging + didn't melt   V. natural... quarantine mascara and lipstick   I think the world being shut down just inspired a lot of us to go basic if and when we do leave the house with make up on...   I think it was more unlearning a lot of things about how to look * natural* and simply taking care of your skin + not wearing a lot of make up for a while that enabled the natural look, a friend of mine was talking about the * quarrantine essentials, lipstick mascara, and some highlighter   I like to see relatively exotic stuff and super bare/ natural/ and glam. I think that the * exotic* and wild colors that explores more of the art-like look and nature of make up, I gravitate to because  I love to dress up/ do wild make up for carnival season- things like silver lips and blue eye liner, so when content that is super artistic and more i guess runway/ exotic if you will draws my attention. I also like campaigns that feel raw and natural, like the person in the add or information is not a super model and has a story that I can relate to. Last i enjoy glamor, old hollywood, jewels, sparkles, classic look- because that kind of timeless beauty I am attracted to - and I always appreciate when content is a video that is a story line and creative rather than a super bland tutorial or add    I think that there are pros and cons, I think the pro is that a brand gets to have an expert and professional amplify the product and share it- and create a brand loyal, who also can play a role in potentially improving products. However, I also see it as flawed because true artists/ creatives should not be tied to a single brand in ways that would prevent them from exploring other new things / creative output based on their restrictions from the brand. I think my opinion maybe unique as an artist myself, and some people may love to see an *expert* or *icon* aligned with a brand, personally I would prefer that the ambassador type role isn't a make up artist, because I am not a make up artist, and I would rather be able to relate to the person buying/ putting on the make up as opposed to some other wordly expert with excess experience + $ for their job   Honestly, I can't quite think of anything in particular as I haven't really been on social media in this area. Most the collabs I remember are between celebrities and brands not make up artists, because I am not hyper familiar with all of the make up gurus! since my gurus have been my friends and that's how I get most of the knowledge through other people who follow the gurus!    I would read above, as I can't get beyond that this is a video of a woman talking about make up in namibia and not talking about femicide - sexual & gender based violence   See above! Think there is enough detail there- I find that luxury brands with even the smallest sense of social impact reach a wider audience, regardless if they are only trying to cater to an audience that doesn't care beyond their own priorities and luxury experience/ isn't trying to be political- it's very important to understand what you aren't/ are saying by what you are putting into the consumer lens   I appreciate the focus on inner strength, focus on the artistic component and simplistic explanation of use of the make up- the energy of the models- the multiple languages ( though subtitles would be beneficial)   I think that the explanation of the product in a very natural and non-expert simplistic way is beneficial, I think the use of him with models in context of his work is important vs just a general consumer and letting the models beauty speak itself   I think identifying a bit of the source of the fashion or combination of why the make up matches with the look - why is it chosen and how the make up here has colors/ tones/ works for all these ethnicities- I think that's a lapse here because the diversity in the campaign is engaging  I would have them include a human being in the campaign that isn't just the make up artist, it feels relatively isolating in this solo trip and peculiar to express a vision / artistic direction for a product itself that consumer would buy- the video is that of an artist, and of couse she provides artistic direction but it doesn't invite the viewer to engage with the product and I didn't feel transported to namibia with the make up nor that I had an inkling of understanding about the place besides it's environment. I would also include the feedback I gave in the other area about the video regarding the neglect of realizing this film was made in a country undergoing extreme turmoil related to femicide + gender based violence ,yet there seems to be 0 awareness / concern. Of course, I don't expect Chanel to be a political think tank, but I would have advised them to choose a source of inspiration that ISN'T in turmoil or that didn't feel so bizarrely detached/ appropriating/ colonist",Guru,ENFP
399146,Misha,Shah,mishashah2010@gmail.com,"I love my smile here!  I think that the lighting was gorgeous during this picture.  I love how my eyes are all glammed up, smokey and so beautiful with purple eyeshadow(my fave!) and eyeliner to line my beautiful almond eyes.  Purple is so great to complement my natural green eyes and my complexion is perfect!  My best friend would say that I look beautiful on the inside and outside! I love Tarte, Maybelline, Dior, Nars, Tatcha, Drunk Elephant, and The Ordinary I would definitley miss my lippies and mascara.  I think that I love to highlight my sexiest features which are my eyes and my lips.  I feel like when you are out or even in photos, you tend to look at the eyes or the lips first I believe that my interest in makeup has drastically increased in 2020.  We are held to stay at home and I discovered Youtube tutorials, TikTok, and Instagram over this summer.  I noticed that I had a vested interest in my skincare routine, which has helped get my skin clear and glowing. When your skin is almost perfect, there is no longer a need to cover your imperfections but only enhance your features. I wear less foundation and simply focus on my eyes and lips now :)  If I want a full face, I can conceal, contour, and bronze :) I believe that right now, I am really excited about Natasha Denona!  When I first discovered her brand, I noticed how luxury it felt.  IT was expensive but the pigments were so gorgeous as well!  As I have gone through my makeup education, I feel like I have learned that it is all about the quality of the pigment, the fallout reserve, and making sure that all of the colors blend with various mattes and shimmers. I love makeup gurus that are genuine and honest.  I love Allie Glines, she is always genuine, honest, and really down-to-earth.  She tends to help her audience with guided tutorials, enhances her natural beauty, and also helps us discover new brands.  Her skin tone is similar to mine, so i use her as a comparable scale when I am buying new makeup, luxury or drugstore.  

I hate beauty influencers that do not know too much about makeup, bullshit on their knowledge, and do a crappy job of applying makeup.  Not everyone can do it right so I am not going to respect their decisions.  I feel like a makeup guru is someone that knows his or her craft.  They have a huge collection of luxury and drugstore, their makeup looks impeccable, and they relate to their audience by being humble, sweet, and genuine.  I like it when a guru is fun and exciting.  They tend to say things suck, because they are not to be bought by the brand.  I like it when an influencer bashes a product.  Allie Glines, Makeup by Kat, Mikayla   They are fun, energetic, and love the before and after!   They tend to not give a care in the world, which shows their credibility   I heard about this palette from Allie Glines.  She said it was quite a splurge but it was totally worth it!  After talking about it, she showed a detailed tutorial about how she achieved her desired look, and it was so gorgeous!   All of the shades are gorgeous! Also, I loved how there was no fallout at all. It is so blendable.  It also seemed like it was so easy to create since the pigment does not need a lot of effort   She is gorgeous, inside and out.  Also, since our skin tones are similar, I know that the look would look good on me too.  I want everything she has, I love her!!!   Specific application enticed me to grab it and try it out myself!   I love to see the bronzed and dewy look right now   I saw it from Allie Glines, she inspired me to get the glow and bronzed.    She made a tutuorial on dewy and glowy skin.  it was all about youtube tutorials.   I love watching youtube and tiktok.  They are so addicive, educational, and it is also a way to relieve stress as well, especially right now    I think that these partnerships means that they are backed by pretigious brands like Chanel and Christian Dior, but neither of them look or their art does not depict the prestige that I would expect from these brands. I am really disappointed. I think that if you are a MUA, you need to showcase that in your work, which clearly was not displayed on instagram.  Also, how have I not heard of either of them?  I am a beauty enthusiast and I would expect that they would be able to advertise properly and go viral   I think that Janelle moane really wowed me and Allie Glines are really amaizng!   It ruins it and it is not going to help the brand at all.  Chanel is a household name but incorportating this kind of crap is only going to make millenials and gen zer's walk away.  Already, prestige is not affordable and we are in the midst of a pandemic.  Once this calms, people are not going to have the discretionary money to buy their products, esp with Lucia at the helm   I think that someone younger, knowledgeable, creative, and great a makeup would really give their name a better standing.  Seriously, consider Allie Glines or Neeta Mann, two stunning young millenials that know about beauty and exude sweetness.  Chanel should hire either of them!   it is not special; however, I think that Peter is better than Lucia.  He is still too bold for Dior.  Dior is known to be delicate and classic, he is going outside of that realm.   I think that Dior could use someone that changes the boundaries, but I think that peter is a bit much   I think that Dior needs to find someone younger and more classy.  The reason that Dior has done so well over the years is because my grandma used Dior, therefore, you want to keep up with the tradition  I think that they should get rid fo Lucia.  She is not good and does not fit what I would think Chanel should be doing.  If Chanel wants to survive this pandemic, they need to seriously consider some newer, fresher looks from the likes of Allie Glines and Neeta Mann.  There are so many MUA""s that are gorgeous and authentic, so many to choose from, what made them choose such an old and horrid MUA like Lucia?",Guru,
399147,Julia,Valverde,julsvv@gmail.com,"A women determined, brave, enterprising, selective, passionnante about fashion, her work and her friends. This is a photo of just only my day to day make up, the products that I carry always with me. For the skin, concealer, powder and also some lipsticks, I preferred  the brand Mac, it's  just a question of color Because i dont like the packaging at all but it a brand where is easy to find a nice color to match my skin tone. Usually for lipsticks a prefer premium brand, my favourite one is YSL, it the best brand for me, the products smell good, the texture and colors are extraordinary and the packagings are the best, they come in thing gold and you can always use it as a mirror. Concealer, with just this product my face change a lot, it gives me light and color with a natural look, after this product it will be the lipstick, I like this product because it make me feel feminine and it add some color to my life At the beginning of the lockdown, I’ve stopped to use make up but after sometime I was feeling a bit sad, I missed getting dress up and do my makeup, I felt some part of me was missing, so I started to put red lipstick every day, even just to stay all day at home, but just with this change, it helps me a lot. After the lock down, as I have to wear them all the time the mask, if I wear a lot of makeup, the mask gets dirty and I don't like it, so I change my routine for more makeup in the eye area and just use lipstick, foundation, powder. When I am going to a restaurant I love the new collaboration of Chiara ferrangi and Lancome, I love the colors, the packaging. A-Chiara Ferrangi, I love her looks and how she change so often the eye shadows design b: she usually has a professional make up artist that make her makeup.
A-Gala Gonzalez: her make up is looks Natural, healthy and with nice glow B don't use new colors  They have a nice look, skin and style. They are used  to profesional make up and them they can manage to make a professional finishing when   they make their makeup at home.   As they are quite famous in the fashion and beauty industry, they are able to choose between different brands to collaborate, most of the Influencers just promote the Brands that pay them, so you can not trust 100% their opinion.   I heard in onstage, first was with Alissainthecity, then with Leandra Medine and few others   The natural color and shape of the packaging   I like the way it looks, natural and also you can use it for lips and chicks. The shape of it looked different and easy to apply.   The use for the lips and chicks 
 It has SPF protection 
 And has a menthol  smell   my favourite look at the moment is the alexandria ocasio-cortez look.   I was inspired for the tutorial that she made for Vogue.   In the vogue’s video, she explain how she makes it each step and what products she uses.   I like very much vogue’s videos of celebrities explaining how they do their make, I found them inspiring and I've always discovered a new product or technique. I like the tutorials because they look natural, they do their makeup at home and it does look like it how they usually do it.    I think the settle future bigger trends, as the catwalk shows for fashion industry.   I can’t think of anyone relevant to me. They are not so relevant to me, I prefer the collaboration of brands with influencers   I prefer the videos that she made with different model explaining how to use each product, giving ideas of differed looks.   The looks are very classy and not much color, and there aren’t new products or new packaging. I think with new collaboration you have to offer new products or something new about the product   This collaboration is more special because the looks are new and more trendy. Even the look of the show is more trendy than the usually classic Dior style   It gives the impression that you can make new looks full of colors and really trendy with the products of the band.   New eyeshadows palettes as the denim one or new products. But this collaboration is much more interesting than the Lucia Pica  Make looks with more color, work more the eyes area, as when we are wearing the mask, it is the most visible part of the face. We know that channel is a classic brand, famous for the tweet, but they manage to make it adapted to the trends of each season, I think they should do the same with the makeup.",Guru,
341332,Amandine ,Yuan,782458157@qq.com,"I like many photos of myself, the below one I took this month. This is a selfie so you can see my face clearly as we are working on a makeup project. This is part of my make-up. I like lipsticks a lot, I wear lipstick everyday and I think it has the magic power to make a girl become bright and shine. For the brands I have, I would say I like Chanel the most. There are several reasons I like this brand: 1. Once I walked into a cosmetic store in Paris, the salesman used a lipbrush to put Chanel lipstick on me, he was very professional and careful,  I could see the change that brought by the lipstick immediately. I could feel that I look more confident.  It was a mixed feeling of the saleman, the color of the lipstick and the good mood I had at that moment. I started to like this brand since then. 2. For the Chanel liptick in the picture, you need to press the top to get it. It always feel so nice when you use it, the design makes it very special and elegant. The color is gold and black, they match very well. 3. I like red lipstick, I think as a woman, this is the color to show the confidence, power and beauty. For many other brands I tried, they are either too dry or too shiny that looks like oil left from lunch. Chanel has found the balance. 4. As everybody knows, this brand shows beauty and elegance. I want to be a beautiful and elegant woman. I think I would miss lipstick the most. 
For foundation, its function is to make your skin look better. But I'm still young and my skin is good enough without it, so I can live without it. For eyebrow pencil, this probably is the tool most Asian girls use everyday. Becasue we don't have much hair so most Asian girls don't have perfect eyebrows, they might just have part of it and we need to use eyebrow pencils to complete the other half and make it look better. I know many girls in the company only use eyebrow pencils everyday, and some other girls have eyebrow tattoos, so for them it is easier but they need to go to salon every half year to make sure the color of their eyebrow is still good enough. For me, I am lucky I have eyebrows not perfect but good enough for me. As for eyeshadow, mascara, eyeline pencil and other cosmetics for eyes, I think they would make my eyes dry and not comfotable for wearing them whole day since I wear contact lenses. In regard of highlighter powder, shadow, blusher and other cosmetics for skin, as I mentioned above, it is nice to have them but not what I would miss the most. 
Lipstick is quick, easy and something has wonderful effects, so I think I would miss it the most. The life is very different this year.
I come from Wuhan and live in shanghai. I came back to shanghai before Chinese New Year and I had to be quarantined for two weeks. For that two weeks, I barely use makeup but I used a lot of skin care products. For the next few months after quarantine, I still need to go to office from time to time, so the frequency of cosmetic use has decreased a lot. And I had to be careful with using since most stores are still closed, if I run out od some kind of makeup, it's hard for me to buy even from online. The role cosmetic plays in my life has changed a bit during these few months but when everything went back to normal, the role went back to normal as well. If I need to be in quarantine for months, I think the role would change a lot because I would use very little of cosmetics. There are eyeline styles I have seen recently and I really like them. Such as using coloful eyeliner to draw only the end of the eye and using black eyeliner to draw the rest, using a eyeliner to draw a unique eyeline with a gap in the middle, it looks like there is one part of the eyeline is missing.
The new colors of lipsticks always excites me and the girls I know. There is an internet celebrity named 李佳琦Austin who is very good at selling lipsticks. He recommended many lipsticks and most of them sell well.
There is another thing I noticed recently is more men started to use cosmetics such as foundations, eyebrow pencils, etc. a. Makeup gurus I like are: 李佳琦Austin，Pony，张凯毅Kevin. They all have very good makeup skills and the products they recommend are mostly good, they have their special characters and people trust them more. 
b. Makeup gurus I don't like are those wo are not professional at all and only want to earn money, they recommend some products they have never used and saying something like: this is the best i have ever used. As a makeup guru, she or he has to be honest first to the public.  As a makeup guru, he or she should not only have the beauty makeup technology and his own unique aesthetics, but also timely receive the market information and adjust the makeup style according to the market changes. I think a makeup guru should have the ability to make the whole look more advanced and more design-inspired through subtle details and tricks. They should have a lot of tips they learned through experience that make their makeup special.   The basic influencers are more just follow others. In my opinion, a makeup guru needs to lead the trend of this industry and make more people like the trend he leads through his skills and influence. A unique aesthetic is necessary, but an aesthetic should be based on what is acceptable to the general public. It is better for them to be very creative and to be able to set off new ideas and new fashion styles constantly.   Because I like red lipstick very much, Dior 999 is very famous and it is the classic classic red lipstick. I heared this lipstick from friends' introductions, many advertisements, online videos and online celebrity recommendations.   Its color. Many brands have red lipsticks, but the classic Dior 999 has its own charm. Wearing this lipstick, I feel very beautiful and powerful.   Actually, as you noticed, I put two lipsticks, they are both Dior 999 but different models. Because I like the color of this lipstick, I first bought B, but I don't like it very much, because this matte lipstick is very dry and sticky. After applying it, I feel very uncomfortable, and it will agglomerate after a few hours. This left me with a very bad impression of this lipstick. But once I watched 李佳琦Austin's video in which he compared six Dior 999, and when he tried Lipstick B, the comments were very much in line with what I thought -- the lip gloss was terrible. In this video, he said that lipstick A was the best among the six, so I bought A again. It was really good and I liked it very much!   Of the six lipsticks he tries, he personally applies each to his mouth, sensing the color and texture. This video is very clear for audiences. And in the video, he also asked his colleagues to try it. The effect on his mouth was the same, which made his words more convincing.   These days I like to try out new eye makeup, such as sequins and colored eyeliner.   When I first heard about the sequin eye makeup, I saw some videos posted by Chinese celebrities on social media platforms. Many of them were sequin eye makeup, which I liked very much. Later, I found that some friends around me were also trying sequin eye makeup. I first heard about colored eyeliner from a Friend in France, but at the time I didn't think colors like blue or brown-red suited Asians very well. Later, I saw some stars on social media began to try colored eyeliner, but because of the different makeup methods, it looked very beautiful and special. But these two kinds of eye makeup methods, I learned how to draw them through Pony(Korean). Her videos are quite detailed.   The key of sequin eye makeup depends on sequin or glitter part, after finishing all eye makeup, use finger pulp gently get some glitters, apply to the upper part of the eyeball. There is no need to apply sequins or glitters over the whole eyeshadow area as we need them to brighten up the look and make it more attractive. The glitter eye shadow we use should not be very dry or the glitter will fall off and affect the base makeup on the face. Like a normal black eyeliner, I use liquid eyeliner. My requirements for liquid eyeliner are smooth, the tip of the pen should not split, easy to color, and the weight of the pen should be moderate, which can help my hand to maintain balance more easily during operation. My current favorite liquid eyeliner is Kate, a Japanese brand.   I like the new lip and eye makeup. According to my current skin condition, it's fine. I don't need to spend a lot of time on face base makeup, and I don't need a lot of foundation to cover up my skin defects. So I focus on eye makeup and lipstick. In fact, this is also the part that most people pay attention to. The color and style of these two parts determine the overall makeup style. Meanwhile, eye makeup requires a lot of skills, which I am also very interested in. New eye and lip makeup always opens me up to more possibilities, and I want to be able to discover new things all the time and reflect more possibilities on my face. I don't want to be stuck in a rut. I can feel different with different eye and lip makeup.   a. I like the makeup style, her style seems appropriate for everyday makeup. b. Lots of photos of famous people, looking very professional. c. I know this guy, and the first video i have watched twice on Tik Tok. d. A little bit weird style for me.   Star makeup artists bring more possibilities to luxury makeup brands. For example, a product may be very good, but consumers do not know its advantages. Star makeup artists, through their professional skills and influence, let consumers know what is good about the product, drive consumers' purchasing power, and bring more publicity effect to cosmetics brands. Their role is to guide consumers, and because of their achievements in the field of makeup, the audience naturally thinks that the products they use in this field must be better.   Precious Rock, an eye shadow by Dior, Peter Philips used it to create a holiday look that looks expensive, retro and upmarket. I was very impressed by this makeup look after watching the video, and I wanted to try it on myself immediately after watching it. Now I knew that the makeup artist's name is Peter Philips.   I don't know about Lucia Pica's impact on chanel make-up sales, but what I do know is that she once put make-up on Kristen Stewart with the wrong eyeliner, and then she rubbed it with her thumb and got the smoky eye effect she wanted. So some of the star power she brings to the brand is also important. In general, Lucia Pica is the icing on the cake.   Perhaps Lucia Pica could create more creative, eye-popping looks for CHANEL's new products, especially for celebrity collaborations. This is attractive to me, because to be honest, many brands now have similar colors and substitutes for the color and texture of makeup. In this case, creativity or multiple uses of the same product make me more willing to pay.   Lucia Pica is a famous makeup artist. I think Chanel chose this makeup artist not only because of her understanding of makeup, but also because of her sensitivity to color as a woman. In a world where color combinations and subtle differences are often taken into account, this makeup artist seems very good at it.

I like the concept in the video and the makeup artist's accurate description of colors. I think, as a consumer, maybe I also want to see makeup artists' suggestions on makeup, such as talking about orange and pink, what colors should be used in what situations, or what combinations will produce what effects.
At the same time, working with celebrities is also fun, which will enhance the topic of the product itself, while also showing the skills of the makeup artist to consumers.",Guru,
399154,David ,Goddard,dssgoddard@gmail.com,""" David is the guy you leave a party with to go get McDonald’s and make a lifelong, meaningful connection. "" Honestly, my collection is less focused on brands and more focused on function / versatility. I feel connected to my concealers because I use them like paint. L.A. girl offers a large variety of colors which allows me to match any skin tone and I can mix colors to make custom shades. I can also easily manipulate the coverage by mixing in something like a lotion to dilute the formula if need be. I would miss blush. I find it remarkably charming. I think that blush application can completely change a look, set a mood, and can be used in more places that just the cheeks. As a photographer / makeup artist, it has affected my ability to work. Physical contact is essential in makeup application - or so I thought before all of this. I now offer pre - shoot zoom sessions to do makeup consultations that help minimize day of contact. This process has forced me to be able to communicate with clients about application and technique in a very clear way. Now that I have started to do makeup again, I would say the break has given me a deeper appreciation for the ritual, the intimacy, and the meditative process of applying makeup. I love being able to work on something that is essentially a living painting and I love being able to show someone a version of themselves that feels true to them, or that they haven't seen before. 2020 has been challenging in many ways and has forced people to figure out what they are made of in a sense and there is an important connection between how you look and how you feel. On a day you don't feel your best, putting yourself together can give you even the smallest boost that can help push towards who you want to be. It's true that if you look good - however that looks to you, you feel better. It's not shallow or trite to make yourself up - for a photoshoot , a zoom call , or a day by yourself in your home. For me, luxury is relative. Any makeup can be a luxury. The ability to control or change your appearance is a luxury. I think Fenty Beauty has completely disrupted the industry in a fantastic way. Fenty has reminded people of the importance of inclusion and representation ON TOP OF providing great versatile products. Fenty is a brand that stands for beauty without a box and Rihanna continues to innovate and inspire with this work. A. I love that make-up gurus at best offer specific points of view that can help anyone feel represented. People like Nikkietutorials, Nyma Tang, Jackie Aina, and Patrick Star stand out to me as gurus who offer what feels like genuine perspectives and multifaceted opinions of makeup and the art of it. They all have aesthetics they are drawn to - they all play with trends and product, but there is a level of artistry that I appreciate - it's not just focused on product and consumption. With gurus in general - there is something for everyone and there is an approachability factor to them that is great. 


B. At worst I think make-up gurus can add to an overly consumption based attitude towards beauty, a one size fits all approach to techniques, and a shallow outlook on makeup. I personally respond more to artistry and technique and shy away from product focused channels unless it is something that I am very curious about.  A person who has a clear vested interest in makeup and the ability to use it on themselves or others in an inspiring way. I don't think a guru needs to specifically be a makeup artist, but I would consider someone who can be versatile with their craft and adapt their skills to other faces / looks / situations a guru. I think they should have a deeper than average language around makeup.   I think any good influencer has a genuine connection to whatever they have influence over. As far as setting makeup gurus apart from 'basic influencers' - I think being in the beauty community is just being in another lane on the same road. If there is a distinction, maybe it is that a guru isn't ""influencing"" as much as they are sharing knowledge.   I can't be certain - it was a while ago, but it might have been in a Nikkietutorials video - it was somewhere on Youtube.   That it was finely milled and didn't have a flashback issue.   The excitement over the no flashback and that it seemed to work on every skin tone - there has since been another shade released for deeper skin tones.   Just the zero flashback, the fine texture, and the versatility in terms of skin tone.   I am really enjoying flushed and natural looks. I'm forever inspired by draped blush.   I was exposed to draping probably first in editorials and then in videos with makeup artists like Lisa Eldridge.   Videos and trial and error. Depending on skin types / texture I either use more cream based products blending with my fingers or I go in with layers of powders - sometimes both. The biggest thing I've learned from artists like Lisa Eldridge and Mary Greenwell is that its about layers and letting things sink into skin.   I tend to forgo instruction and just go for trying it myself and figuring it out. I do get a lot of inspiration from  magazine editorials, paintings, and art. I enjoy watching videos on Youtube from time to time - mostly from Lisa Eldridge and Nikkietutorials. I feel more connected to Lisa's work - but Nikkie has incredible energy and feels current in a way that is genuine.    I think there is immense opportunity when an established make-up artist decides to partner with a luxury brand or start there own. Lisa Eldridge being the creative director at Lancome makes sense to me, her refined and elegant approach is right at home with Lancome. She was the creative director at Shiseido prior to this and her knowledge about product and her skills as a working artist makes me trust a product more because I respect her. These partnerships offer a greater sense of trust between product and consumer because you believe these people wouldn't put their name on a bad product and you know they have the experience to release something that works. I think these partnerships play a role in the beauty space in the way that people respond to authenticity in brands more than ever. A strong brand identity, luxury or otherwise can help a brand sink or swim and the visible person attached to a brand plays a key part in that. In the sense of Lucia and Peter being attached to Chanel and Dior - I love it. I think it's a lovely way to streamline an aesthetic and imbue a point of view into the brand. Lucia brings her chic relaxed attitude to Chanel and evokes the woman of her own design mentality of Gabrielle Chanel and Peter feels like a Max Factor making up Dior girls. You believe that Lucia and Peter believe in their vision - under the umbrella of the brands they work for. I think it brings a sense of educated romance to the partnership and deepens the artistic roots of the brands.   Lucia's work with Chanel is inspiring to me. The Fall 2016 Le Rouge Collection N°1 specifically was really nice. I appreciated the commitment to the color red and campaign was gorgeous. I think Chanel has done a great job at really creating a vibe with their makeup. I think Lucia with her work and also just with herself has been a key part of shaping the continued story of modernity at the house.   It reinforces the history of a woman choosing to make her own way - choosing to look the way she wants. I think Lucia gives a freeness to the brand and offers up space to explore individual expression. It also challenges the superficial nature of makeup and the easy dismissal of luxury items. By talking about the inspiration and the meaning behind the makeup - you reinforce the value of the makeup. Makeup isn't necessarily a necessity, but art and expression is essential to our culture and this partnership celebrates the innate need to express yourself.   I honestly don't feel anything is missing. It feels like a point of view and if there was something I would do differently, it would be my opinion as another artist - not something that feels correct or incorrect.   I think this partnership feels like a kid playing with their dolls - in a great way. I appreciate the excited energy he brings to his work and the sort of focus on singular features. I like how he creates a Dior uniform in a sense, but with allowance for anyone to adapt themselves.   I think it plays on the idea of an artist and muse which I feel aligns Peter with Mr. Dior himself.   I think this collaboration feels a bit heavy handed in the product placement - the video above feels more like a commercial when discussing product. It doesn't bother me as much as I just notice it and I prefer the approach of Lucia with Chanel in the sense that there is more of an abstract discussion of makeup. I'm not being told to by something as much I just have the option to. Does that make sense?   I would like to see more behind the scenes. I would love a documentary of Lucia's beauty journey with and without Chanel. I want to hear from brand ambassadors - past and present about their relationship with makeup and with how they represent themselves. I think it would be really cool to just see more.",Guru,
399155,Tia ,Tanaka,tiatanaka@me.com,"An eccentric gal who gets the job done and knows what she wants. Troiareuke is a brand I feel most embodies me as an individual because it provides functionality and both aesthetics and skincare. I find the duality of the product to be extremely worthwhile and moneys worth as it provides dual purposes. Growing up as an Asian living in western cultures, I found the general aestehtic of makeup to often be extremely bold and heavy. Although the look is great, I often had a hard time creating similar looks on my face as it never fit the general look of my face (monolids, lack of deep in-set eyes, less angular nose, etc). Bold eyeliners, and heavy eyeshadows would often overpower, and often always clashed with my skintone. I also had an extremely hard time wearing foundations as it felt like literal cake on my face due to the weight of the products. After discovering Asian influencers on Tumblr and Youtube, I discovered a whole new collection of makeup and overall looks I was able to create that better suit my face. Although I LOVED when BB creme became a popular commodity, I still found the foundations often too heavy on my face by the end of the day. I was always looking for a foundation that felt like I was not wearing any. Laneige was my first introduction to puff foundations, but the product didn't quite perfectly hit my marks. After hearing about Troiareuke from multiple influencers such as joanday and Edward Avila, I was really intrigued by the idea of a foundation that also worked as skincare/professional level skin perscriptions. I loved that aestheticians were able to reccommend a product that was safe to use on sesntive skin and even post skin facials when the skin is most sesitive. Being a fashion design student, I'm often proded with the question of how we will change the future of fashion as the fashion industry is extremely harmful to the environment. The fact that a makeup brand has also offered ways to create dual product that doesn't serve a single purpose is extremely interesting and inspiring for my own collection in the future. If makeup no longer existed, I would most importantly miss lashes. I find all my looks to surround lashes, and I believe almost all makeup looks better with lashes. In highschool, I used to wear extremely heavy eyeliner which at the time would have been my most missed item... some would have maybe called me an ABG (slang term populated in California as ""Asian Baby Girl"" which is a type of Asian American girl that likes to attend raves, often in an Asian University sorotity, and drinks bubble tea on a daily basis). However, due to my eye shape, I found eyeliner often looked really heavy on my eyelids and often just made me look raccoon-eyed. After getting into different types of makeup when moving to London and attending university, I found interest in doing looks that no longer involved eyeliner. However, with most non-lined looks, although it appears more natural... the look was never dramatic enough for my own personal taste. I started using lashes which I feel brightens the eyeballs and creates any type of look I want. There is a multitude of different types of lashes which changes the look dramatically depending on what you are going for: cute, sexy, natural, dolly, costume, etc. Although people may have reccommended me getting lash extrensions (because I wear lashes almost everyday), I find the duality of fake glued lashes a lot more fun as lash extensions only have one look, and it limits greatly the amount of stuff you can do with your eyes as theres lots of rules to the maitenance. As an ethnic Japanese who wasn't blessed with long eyelashes (let alone eyelashes that don't droop over the eyes), I would very much miss the freedom fake eyelashes give to me creating a great look. Right when lockdown happened, I had to return from New York (where I worked for a year) to then move back to my hometown in California. Due to stress and possibly the bad pollution in New York, I found my skin having an extremely bad reaction as to what felt like a second puberty. Due to this, I ended up researching a lot on my down time back home into rememdies for skin care and fixing my skin. Although I greatly love makeup, I found that skin care was never a huge priority of mine as it involves personal care rather than creative freedom (which I prefer more). I ended up asking many friends and researching about different types of products online in order to get the best affordable remedy for my skin. What used to just be night cremes and lotion, became a twice daily full morning and night-time skin routine (with the occasional face masks). Because I didn't leave the house much due to the pandemic, it ended up being a great time to try and cure my skin. My use of makeup became less and I focused more on skin care. Although my skin isn't perfect still, nor is my skin care routine as extreme.... I find that I now take a lot more care for my skin than I did in other years. I also have a better understanding of things that work and don't work... as well as how much my skin can take. As colourism is still an extremely controversial topic in Asia, lighter skin-tones are still often more desired or preferred. Due to this, I was often naive taking inspiration from Asian influencers and wearing lighter foundations, using lemon and other lightening products that were harmful to my skin, and overall using strange DIY methods to perfecting what I thought was ""ideal"". Although there was a lot of great things I learned from Asian influencers, skin bleaching is a common issue that is relevant in all of Asia (including places like Japan, China, Korea, and specifically Phillipines). Even though Asian products are showing a better range of shades and theres less advertisement for skin bleaching products... I still believe Asia has a very problematic issue that shouldn't be enforced when making products. Although brightening products are more often popular products, I feel companies shoudln't even be pushing such as it just reinforces the issue that ""lighter is better"".  

Although I've been focusing more on my skin, I've also taken up online streaming as a past-time enjoyment/job. Although I have personal freedom to wear anything I want, I would much prefer to look professional as others are watching and I am in a way putting on a show. Due to this, I've taken up the creative freedom to wear and dress however I want as I'm only in my room. Although I have full confidence with wearing strange and unsual looks in public, I love testing out different looks at home sometimes before going out. There is also the handful of fantasy looks that I love creating just for photos as they're too uncomfortable to wear around outside/for long hours. Quarantining has allowed me to have more fun with the random looks I can create. What I love most about the luxury makeup space and overall global trends, is the overall representation of Asian inspired makeup looks. As Western beauty trends were always most often the ideal, I found that Asian beauty trends were most often overlooked and only represented in Asia. Trends such as faded ombre-like lip tints were popular in Asia (specficically South Korea) for years and it wasn't until the past few years have Western beauty brands been embracing the style. What saddens me is how it takes a Western company to create a product for a trend to be considered ""trendy"" as the style has been long recognized in Asia for years. Almost all Korean makeup brands, as well as many other asian brands have been selling lip tints as a common commodity for years. Now brands such as Glossier, Dior, Charlotte Tilbury all make lip tints. Although I am excited that I am able to buy products that I want much easier (as asian products are quite hard to purchase when international), I also often feel sketpical of the lack of representation of Asians when advertising a products that are clearly taken from Asian brands. As social media sites such as Tik Tok/Douyin begin to rise, I have also noticed a greater trend in taking all kinds of asian-inspired looks and creating this look called ""e-girl"". Due to this, I appreciate greatly that makeup brands are garnering more creative looks while also akcnowleding asian inspired makeup trends, but I also find it disheartening that asian-inspired looks are been brought down to a title called ""e-girl"". Celebrities such as Doja Cat, who takes a lot of inspiration from Japanese makeup trends, would often tell others how her looks are often inspired by ""Kawaii"" culture in Japan but brands such as Vogue would advertise her makeup look as ""e-girl"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsk9c7KF76E&ab_channel=Vogue). What I appreciate the most however is luxury brands and companies such as Vogue are now asking real asian celebrities and models to represent or be repsented in popualr western companies. Companies such as Vogue and Harpers Bazaar are now asking asian celebrities such as Eric Nam and Tiffany Young to part-take in trending online videos is honestly amazing to see. Although I believe companies have a long way to go in terms of showing a vast knowledge of other cultures as well as being culturally diverse, I appreciate that I am starting to see an overall change within the luxury world. a. What I love about makeup gurus and the ever growing social media presence, I love that anyone can become something. Knowledge that used to be only available at beauty schools are now easily accessed globally. I love that I am able to go on social media and find all types of styles and looks that I normally wouldn't have seen in a magazine or advertisement. As previously mentioned, growing up as an Asian American, I found it extremely hard to find looks and products that suited my face as Western beauty trends never quite fit/suited my style. Makeup gurus allowed me to further express myself while also being creatively free with the vast amount of looks that actually fit my face. Makeup gurus also allow me to see the product before buying it as buying luxury goods and items is an investment when you're not financially free to buy whatever whenever. Asian beauty and fashion magazines (from Asia) are also extremely helpful as they offer looks that suit people like me. They also offer ideal standards of Asian beauty that is honestly quite hard to find in a regular Western based magazine. The problem with this however is that Asian goods are a lot harder to purchase when you're international, or you have to pay a huge fee for shipping... on something that is normal priced in Asia. Because of this, I find it difficult to purchase items more often as its more costly and timely to receive it (if its even available online). 

b. Although magazine companies such as Vogue show some representation of Asians for luxury makeup brands and looks, I found it hard to even picture how the looks could possibly be beneficial for me as Western companies often only hire models that they think represent what asians look like (stereotypical monolids, sharp tiny eyes, flat-face, flat noses, wide faced bone structure, etc). Most models that are popular in the West don't actually fit Asian beauty standards. I find that brands and companies would often hire models that honestly feel like would be the standard of beauty in ancient dynasty asia, but no longer the standard of beauty in Asia today (Like ancient Asian portraits and paintings of women from the past). For example, Gao Qizhen was a contrversial model from Vogue that caused Chinese viewers to feel offended as her looks are not the general standard of Asian beauty. Although her ""weird"" features are interesting, it comes off almost racist and promoting of the asian stereotype as theres not much representation of the general standard of Asian beauty within Western brands (be it from magazines, makeup advertisments, and overall online presence). Although models such as Soo Joo Park, Xiao Wen Ju, and Liu Wen are all very beautiful and talented models, their looks are not  what the general population of Asian women aspire/look up to. Because of this, its hard for Asians to relate as most models don't even offer looks to what most Asians want to look like/look like. Without sites such as douyin, instagram, facebook, etc.... it would be have been almost impossible for me to find relatable products and people who look similar to me.... as well as people who make looks that garner to what I aspire/take inspiration from. On top of it all, I find that the makeup on many Asian models that are popular in the West, often have makeup looks that don't even match their face, let alone looks good.... as it seems that the team who style the models don't undestand that Western makeup often does not suit Asian models who have very different features from causcasian models. Similarly, when I was growing up, I always felt like such a clown when people would put makeup on my face for dance performances, presentations, events, and theatre performances. Colours and makeup that suited others always looked horrendous on my face as my face never suited the look they put on others who were caucasian. I often find because theres such a lack of representation and lack of education about other ethnic minorities, Asian consumers don't buy or can't relate to many makeup gurus or companies that try and advertise to Asia. Because of this, people like me (an Asian living in a Western country) don't buy western products. Its hard for people who don't have the luxury to buy whatever product they want, to invest in luxury goods when they can't even see a proper representation of what it looks on an ideal Asian look/person. Although there are a few brands that are starting to show a better representation of all types of people (eg, Fenty Beauty) or Western companies selling Asian makeup products (Sephora selling Kaja), I find the general public to not be doing the same. Looks often only show caucasian or Black minorities. The only time I ever invest in Western luxury goods is through word of mouth from another Asian, or if there is countless reviews from online Asian influencers where I can physically see what the product looks like on a normal Asian person.  I am a strong believer that anyone can be a makeup guru even without any sort of proper training. Most influencer makeup gurus gained their initial teachings through online platforms such as instagram, twitter, youtube, tumblr, etc.... and I believe anyone else can do so still now. Young influencers such as Bretman Rock and Edward Avila used to create looks that were often not the greatest, however their great success came from capturing the hearts of viewers and gaining a strong following by being themselves. I believe makeup techniques can't be the only thing a makeup guru sells, as the gurus personal narrative and capturing of the audience plays a huge factor into their own success. When James Charles had a scandal regarding alleged sexual harassment and power play, his main social media platform dropped more than 3 million viewers/followers. Despite his videos only revolving around makeup, viewers nowadays take more than the skill into accountability. With the younger generation spending more time on who they buy from, where things come from, where is it made, etc.... there leaves a lot less space for someone to mess up but more opportunities for newer influencers and brands to be recognized. 

Although there is still a strong stigma against cosplayers, I believe many cosplayers to also be makeup gurus as well. They do the same craft with different techniques. Many original youtubers such as Michelle Phan, Dope2111 and Wengie is what I believe to path setters to normalizing the art of creative play with makeup, and creating more than nice looks for one's face. With kpop being a recently global phenomena, many aspire to often look like the kpop stars they love so dearly. In ways, creating looks to mimic another is a form of cosplay that many influencers now make a full time success from. Cosplayers also often recommend makeup that normal makeup gurus do not recommend as often cosplayers need different to create specific looks. Before cosplay makeup tutorials were available, it was very hard to re create similar looks as normal makeup tutorials do not do the same trick. Which is why if you see western cosplayers in the past, makeup looks were often really weird and never quite up to par with those in Asia. 

   I believe there isn't a specific formula to set of boxes to tick for one to be considered a makeup guru. Many successful makeup have garnered their fame through all different types of platforms and methods.... so if anything I believe following the cookie cutter influencer formula will honestly never set you differently from the many aspiring influencers. What sets all the successful influencers apart from the basic ones is that influencers need to understand that you have to do more than just one thing. Although there is often strong debate about makeup influencers and professional makeup artists, I find that many don't understand that viewers no longer care solely about the craft. Viewers want to connect, be involved, and overall be inspired. The reason many makeup influencers do well globally is because they sell a persona, sell the craft, and most importantly they connect through multiple platforms and hobbies. An average successful influencer will often have a different personality that stands out, uses multiple social media platforms, has their main videos, shares their other hobbies and business endeavors, maybe blogs or vlogs.... one must do so much more than what they think. Many professional makeup artist have also taken on successful online fame as thats what needs to be done. Successful influencers also must be smart and hop onto global trends that doesnt just involve their craft.   Although unknown about the luxury qualification, I spent what I felt like an investment on an eyeshadow palette from the Jeffree Star x Shane Dawson collection (I have never bought such a large palette previously). I heard about the collection through Shane Dawson's online documentary series about the world of makeup and the inside scoops of the industry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWukx3HGBKI&list=PLDs0tNoNYTz05R0xo7PCVc-RgL2fsJnGg).   What excited me about the product is the whole series immerses you into the world of makeup while also connecting with the collection. Throughout the whole series, Shane Dawson's takes viewers on a journey of getting to know the infamous Jeffree Star, giving us insides about both their personal lives and experiences. On top of it, you also get to see the insides and structure of a makeup company, how it works, what people do, etc. In doing so, Shane Dawson documents the whole process of coming up with the makeup collection from beginning to end. This allowed viewers to garner interest and hype for a product as viewers such as myself can feel a personal relation to the collection. As previously mentioned, becoming successful is more than just the look... and this series was a clear example of it. Shane and Jeffree both sold out completely of all fanmerch and makeup collections within minutes. On top of it all, sales were so large that the site provider actually crashed as there were more than millions of customers waiting on the site for the drop.   I believe the reason for my excitement and my overall motivation to buy the product came hand in hand. The motivation comes from the personal connection I had with the collection as both influencers documented the whole process from beginning to end. When going that in depth with the product and showing how much time and care went into creating such, it makes viewers want to support or feel a sense of excitement for when the product drops live. The fact we were able to see physically what was going into the products and how the product was made throughout the whole year... while also showing the personal struggles of the influencers, it literally grabs you into buying products you may not honestly need.   Because Shane Dawson has never dabbled with makeup, it was interesting to see someone research in depth the differences and qualities of all types of makeup to create what he believed a perfect collection that fit himself and his fans. Because of this, we were also given inside info about how each product fits, how to wear it, why he wanted specific colours... etc etc.   I love taking inspiration from many types of asian looks but I personally love the ""drunk""blushed look from Japan and the puffy-eyed makeup look from both China and Korea. Although I am a lot more tame now, I love the subtle dolly and cute aesthetic.   I first saw the looks in Japanese beauty magazines that I used to buy monthly such as Popteen, Ageha, Kera, ViVi, and fruits. Because it was hard for me to find relatable content when I was younger, I used to take great consideration to what the models were wearing in the Japanese magazines. Influencers such as Pony was an inspiring guru I looked to for trendy Asian makeup looks. With the puffy eye looks coming from old styles such as ulzzang, I was always interested in the natural transformation it has taken since then as I also no longer wear dark heavy eyeliner.   Japanese beauty and fashion magazines are actually extremely helpful as they often show you physical photo tutorials on how to create different trending makeup looks, hairstyles, and nail art. Because of this, it was really easy to taken inspiration for my own looks as theres physical techniques to guide you on such. I believe Asian magazines thrive in comparison to western magazines because they advertise products while also showing how to physically use them. This allows readers to be more inclined with buying the makeup because you can actually see how you can use the product. Although western magazines will often give tiny samples of foundation or lip tint to advertise products, I find it honestly quite useless as the foundation colours only suite caucasian people as well as the many testers they offer; this cuts off all minorities and honestly anyone who isn't the sampled colour; In comparison, although Asian magazines often only show Asian models in the magazines.... it allows viewers (who are mainly Asian as Asian products aren't very popular globally) to see how the look could potentially look on themselves and also how to properly use the product. Because some products are only sold in Asia, I would often as well look to online asian influencers who grew up in foreign countries to see how they use different makeup products to create the same style look.    Nowadays, I often use sites such as pintrest, ig, youtube and tik tok to gain inspiration for my looks. Depending on what I'm looking for, I will search accordingly: pintrest for high fashion looks, ig for influencer basic looks, youtube for genuine tutorials and techniques, and tik tok for fun and daring looks. Although I don't feel like I'm actively looking for makeup looks, as I'm busy with my final collection in Uni, I find that I often am shown such content when scrolling on my free time as my social media algorithms have catered to such. Often times, I enjoy makeup videos that are also entertaining as I often support makeup gurus based on their overall personality rather than skill. Bretman Rock is a great example of someone who involves his striking personality in combonation with the content he produces. In doing so, he produces fun and exciting entertainment that doesnt just invovle beauty.... allowing viewers to always be excited for the content he comes out.    As a young viewer, I find that luxury partnerships with already famous makeup artists do not mean a lot to me personally. With the excess amount of influencers on all the social media sites, I find that personable personalities is what thrives. Although partnerships between make-up artists and luxury brands create a more professional outlook on the brand overall in comparison to brands that chose influencers, I honestly never notice them unless brought up by someone who is more prominent online. Many celebrities will often now collaborate with such influencers as influencers have major impact on the mass majority of younger generation buyers. Celebrities such as Doja Cat, Katy Pery, Mariah Carey, Kardashians, Lady Gaga all now seek online makeup gurus to advertise themselves or even collections they are advertising.... as online makeup gurus are where most younger people watch. Many celebrity makeup artists will often tour where you can pay money to experience and learn about the techniques they can offer, which is all very beneficial to someone who wants to really dive into makeup and professional direction... but as a regular person who only loves makeup as a hobby and freedom of expression, I do not find paying large sums interesting enough to invest in a class. Many users will often even record clips of the classes and teach others online so the information is often free to access.   Although unknown if considered, but I particularly was wow-ed about Mac and Pony's collaboration together. What really excited me about the overall collection was the fact a western brand was collaborating with such an influential Asian makeup artist. Although she is extremely popular in Asia...I find most western videos, if anything, only know her as the girl who can change her face to look like certain celebrities (eg. her Taylor Swift video). Although I haven't been able to personally purchase Pony's actual products due to international struggles, she was always known to have high quality products and aesthetic advertising. Not only did Pony release a makeup collection with Mac, but they also catered to her overall general aesthetic of her own brand on top of creating a whole kpop-esque music video. If the makeup didn't inspire you to buy the product, the aesthetic music surely did as it offers you a taste of the looks you can achieve with the makeup, a catchy tune, and the overall beautiful aesthetics kpop videos often already have. The overall production was stunner as theres not many brands that do things like this.   As stated above, I personally believe the collaboration adds nothing to the brand.   I see no issues with the collaboration, but I find the way of executing and showing it to the world needs to be greatly re-considered. Buyers needs to BUY into a story, a feeling, and an overall experience to want to buy luxury goods. Luxury goods are a luxury, so simple documentaries and old ways of presenting products simply do not cut it. Although luxury items are advertised to higher class people with high enough incomes to afford such products, majority of buyers (or just overall people in the world) come from middle to lower class families... thus there needs to be strong reasons for why buyers want to invest in such products. To put in perspective, I was re-directed over 30 seconds into the video to see what the actual substance of the collaboration was. On youtube, most viewers leave within the first few seconds if not immediately grabbed in, hence why many videos often show an interesting cliffhanger highlight in the video before proceeding with the introduction.... if it took over 30 seconds to actually hear about anything remotely interesting about the overall collaboration, its bound to lose many viewers and potential buyers. With thousands of hours of content being uploaded per minute on youtube ALONE, you need to execute and grab the viewers attention from the immediate start or your content will be washed out.   Again, I do not find anything about the partnership particularly special. If anything, I simply notice the lack of diversity that I've seen in both collaborations... As both seem to highlight only Caucasian and black models... and show literal to no representation for any other ethnic minority. The Asians that are represented also are the generic ""east Asian beauty"" that I've mentioned previously where the standards for Asian beauty from western media is not the same standard of beauty for Asians in Asia. There also seems to be a misconception that Asians are also just east Asians, when Asia includes many other ethnic features that are simply not just Chinese, Korean, and Japanese (which all happen to be the lightest in skin colour of all other Asian ethnic minorities). I find the Peter Phillips partnership to be just as uninteresting as Lucia's.   I believe that the partnership adds nothing to the brand as a whole.   The difference between this video and Lucia's is the initial video starts out very strong and straight to the point. They talk about key points and words of what the collaboration and the overall concept is about (""FOCUS on the eyes"" ). Because it seems like dior doesn't have a consistent viewership with their content, the video in comparison to Lucia's has a lot less views, but I feel the overall execution was significantly better. One concern is that there is zero subtitles so many of the models they ask to talk, cannot be understood unless you know their language. There's also a lack of subtitles as a whole which leaves out many foreign viewers to be able to even understand anything. Many influencers will hire closed captioners because it helps them garner greater viewership and global fans as english is not everyone's language. Many people also have disabilities that do not allow viewers to be able to even listen to the video thus subtitles help greatly. Although unrelated to makeup, the reason why many kpop videos overall have extremely high viewership is because companies will hire people to make subtitles in numerous languages for global fans to understand and further garner a stronger relationship and love for the artists. It also allows people to know they're included rather than excluded because of language barriers. Although many of these reasons seem minor or unrelated to the collaboration, I find that these are all very vital needs to make a partnership and overall successful collaboration... successful.   Please consider the day to day global trends of buyers. For example, you can see how Pony successfully garnered the attention of potential buyers by showing different types of videos to connect with the product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nbTg0EQKCY This video shows a very vlog-esque video promoting the collection while also personally connecting with Pony. Viewers are able to connect not just with the product, but to see the behind the scenes of what goes into the production/post production, a personal connection with the makeup artist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5MzLnExdms She also creates videos showing looks you can create using the products shes advertising, thus it allows viewers to be able to physically see how they can make use of the products they buy, it also allows viewers to be able to feel like they can create the same luxury goods with the tutorials she gives. The video also features subtitles as this allows all types of fans to be able to understand and watch the video. Although most subs are written in english, this does not mean that everyone understands english when listening, thus english videos should honestly also include subtitles regardless of the language being spoken. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8Qf8ELEU70 Lastly, her overall advertisement for the product was done brilliantly to the time it was created, and it clearly showed the team knew the trends of today in order to sell the product.",Guru,
399152,Xinyu,Cheng,maggie.cheng6@hotmail.com,"It is difficult to pick a favourite photo... But, I think my best friend would describe me as an easy going person that pays a lot of attention to detail and a bit of perfectionist as well. Although I would pick Armani as my favourite makeup brand, I would definitely pick Dior as one that best embodies me as a person, I find that with the Dior beauty range, I can always find the shade that works for me. What I mean by that is, I find most products by dior fall under my make up style, which I would describe as natural, low key, and enhancement of features. I am not someone that does crazy eyeshadows, I don't ever really do dramatic looks, and I find that the Dior range really does well with that. The overall attitude of Dior is more elegant, youthful, classy. I would DEFINITELY miss having eyebrows, and concealer/foundation.... all three products are what I considered to be basic yet essential, eyebrows shape the face, and adds life to the overall look, it is difficult to imagine a makeup look with really shapeless eyebrows. The same goes for concealer, foundation, it is difficult to imagine a full glam face that has redness/ pimples speckled across the face. However, we can often imagine a flawless face without the colours on the eyes, on the cheeks, sometimes simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Without having to go to work I definitely reach for my makeup A LOT less, and even when various shopping sites have sales, I find myself purchasing more skincare products than makeup. I am less open to investing in new makeup, when there is no where to go and no one to show. However, the basics have not changed, like I had mentioned in the previous questions. Eyebrows eyebrows EYEBROWS! The one thing that EVERYONE can still see even with a mask on! So I would say right now, the eyebrow powder/gel still get the same love, with everything else put on hold. I have always been a consumer that buys everything I want immediately, the second after an interest has been sparked, that particular interest will have already been acquired. So it is difficult for me to name anything that currently excites me, as the process is usually quite linear, and there is rarely any outstanding interest that I have yet to explore. However, GUCCI beauty recently joined Sephora Canada (my main source of makeup shopping), and I have yet to try any products by them, so I will most likely do that soon. a. purple阿紫, I love this makeup guru because her makeup looks are truly what I consider to be an enhancement of natural features rather than covering. Her makeup looks are on the natural side, and she does this new thai make up style trend that is quite popular amongst Chinese makeup community. Thai makeup can be characterized as more natural, thicker brows, perfect complexion, subtle colour on the eyelids, with more emphasis on contrast and creating depth. 
b. Ohemma, this particular makeup guru resides in Toronto as well, and I keep up with her because her makeup looks are again more on the natural side, and she posts a lot of videos about the reviews on various products, I refer to her videos quite often when I have an itch to spend money. 
c. James Charles, I would not use the word HATE on ANY makeup gurus whatsoever, unless their personal values were truly in offence to mine. However, I don't usually watch James Charles' videos as I find his makeup looks to be way too dramatic/ heavy for my personal preference, and I also am highly skeptical when it comes to purchasing makeup created by influencers, and therefore tend to steer away from any that have their own makeup line, their videos are often convoluted with self promotion.  I would say the very least is that the make up looks they create fit with the general consensus of ""normal"", which could include a number of things such as does the makeup look clean, is it pleasing to the eye, are they able to create a smooth base, do their eyebrows look even, etc. These are very basic requirements, but without fulfilling the basics, one certainly would not qualify as a ""make-up guru"". For me personally, from make-up gurus i like to see that they are willing to attempt new looks or try new products. I should feel some sort of inspiration from them, their techniques should be always updated, it is key for makeup gurus to always ""innovate"" their looks, and bring new content to viewers.   The make-up gurus i follow are what i consider to be the ones that truly understand the taste of their followers, or they understand what the majority of public are looking for. For example, the make up gurus i follow would never attempt the same look that James Charles might do, because they understand that they will not gain fanbase from such content, and may even risk losing the ones that follow them for different types of looks. They understand the market, they interact with the market, they have a distinguished taste and do not attempt to emulate another influencer.   I did actually purchase this product in various shades, but I am unable to take pictures of them at the moment. I heard about this product through ohemma on youtube   Ohemma actually made a whole video testing the entire line, and she picked out some of her personal favourites, and what she thought would look nice on asian complexion. The way she described the texture made me excited about the product.   Emma actually not only picked out her favourite shades, but also describes the kind of look the particular shade would look nice with, she went as far as comparing it to a ""persona""   Emma did mention something about the applicator of this particular lipstick, how depending on the side used, there is a different amount of product being put on your lips. This did not really make me want to buy it more, mostly because i had already set my mind on it before she said anything about the applicator.   I am super into the thai makeup trend that is immensely popular amongst the chinese makeup community.   I think this particular look has always been around, but it was never super popular until recently. Trends come and go, korean makeup style was the trend for a while, and it has now switched to thai. purple阿紫 was the guru that first inspired me   I think with any make up look, it is important to first identify the features that defines the look, for thai make up, it usually involves a very perfect well done base with little to none imperfections, well shaped, relatively thicker brows, light neutral colours on the eyelids. I would not say I have perfect the look, but I do follow those techniques in order to get it as close to perfect as I can. When it comes to products, because the requirements of the look is so basic, it does not require any particular product in order to create the look, the products involved are what every girl normally has in their collection.   I like learning about new looks through content that involves new products, i guess in a way it is also about efficiency? new products, new look, new technique all within one video. I also like celebrity inspired make up looks, if that particular celebrity has a look that I like, I would definitely watch it.   Lucia Pica is obviously VERY chanel, because I recently deactivated instagram I was not able to go through her entire profile, but based on the first couple of posts, her posts do not really sell the products however, I am biased because I naturally gravitate towards anything chanel, but looking at her instagram I don't feel the need to snatch any products up right away. Her page is very ""art"" focused, she does not try to cater to any groups in particular  Charlotte Tilbury's page is very obvious that she is selling you her products, I do appreciate the inclusively by including non-white models on her page (from the first 12 posts), showcases her products will, if I read more into it, I will probably end up purchasing something  毛戈平 is a very famous make up artist in China, by going through his weibo, aside from sharing photos from events or collaborations, his makeup content is very technique focused, meaning he does not often attempt to achieve a certain look, he tends to work with the model's face, and educates viewers on how to hide/enhance features.  Peter Philips very art focused, even more so than Lucia Pica, does not seem to be selling any products in particular based off quick look, does not seem to reach to the masses by attempting to educate.   I think a lot of times when luxury brands come out with certain products, the public are not always aware of how to best use the products. It helps to have star make up artists then, to demonstrate to the mass how best to utilize these newly released products. I think in this sense, star make up artists pose as an essential link between the brand itself and the consumers. They delivery new information and techniques to the beauty space, and they are essentially the vehicle that new products ride into the world of consumers with.   I think the last time that I was really wowed was when YSL released touche elat highlighters, I remember being a little confused about the product because the consistency seemed so light, yet it was advertised to be the most life changing product ever. I think it had the slogan of something along the lines of ""8 hours of sleep bottled in one product"" (i could be wrong). When the makeup artist demonstrated the product on the model, the versatility of the product really shone through, and convinced me to buy it immediately.   Through this video, Lucia Pica is able to sell the brand in a way that each viewer can take away a unique interpretation from. She also does a great job expressing the image of the brand, by creating a fairytale of colours through words.   This collaboration could perhaps be more interesting and meaningful if some pictures of products can be woven throughout the various imageries of nature, to further fortify the notion that inspiration comes from the nature.   From the youtube video attached, i think the partnership between the brand and the artist is special because it is done in connection to a runway show, the partnership connects dior fashion and dior makeup together. It was interesting to see how products that average consumers have access to can be utilized in such a high fashion setting - runway show.   The makeup look that Peter Philips created for Christian Dior in the youtube video attached incorporated elements of daily look as well as intense ""special occasion"" look. The base he created on each of the models would be considered as ""daily look"" and in doing so he successfully advertised the dior foundation. Although the eyeliner look he did on the models was very high fashion, consumers are still drawn in because eyeliner itself is a versatile tool, and can be used accordingly to personal style. The entire video demonstrates how versatile dior makeup products are, and how they can be used as a tools of creativity.   I think if Peter Philips created more varied looks instead of the same exact look on every model, would have made this collaboration more interesting.  I love the colours, I love the beauty in the video, I love the nature imagery, I love the verbal descriptions of inspirations, but provide me with a bridge to link everything back to make up, show me the pretty colours on the face, extend your inspiration to a particular product, show me the world you have just created in your video condensed in a makeup look.",Guru,
399153,Delaney ,Bedford,delaneyfrancis6@gmail.com,"Delaney is a witty and fun person, she's the life of the party whilst also being a down-to-earth gem that can have a conversation about anything. I would say the brands that embody me as a person are Fenty Beauty, Urban Decay, YSL and Clinique. Fenty are a brand that accepts everyone and their individual beauty and works to enhance that. They are inclusive, high performance and make artistry-level makeup. I'd say this aligns with how I see the world; everyone has their unique beauty and power and I love to see that in everyone I meet. Urban Decay are very similar in the fact that they are a brand that strives to be for everyone and they are very expressive in what they make. They love colour, glitter and innovation. I would definitely say that sentence could also be said about me. YSL are that young, edgy brand that create beautiful high fashion looks and cosmetics. I feel like sometimes people forget what incredible formulas they have and the potential they have. I really identify with this because I feel like oftentimes underestimate my potential when I actually have an abundance of talent and drive. I also love edgy style and fashion. I had to include Clinique because they include skincare in almost everything they create. I am absolutely obsessed with skincare and I would have enjoyed chemistry a *lot* more if we got to study skincare ingredients in school. I think I would miss colour products the most. Simple things like blush and eyeshadow bring me so much joy. I love being able to transform myself with colour and enhance my ginger hair and blue eyes. I would miss the even skin tone that foundation brings but my skincare collection is probably enough to help combat that! I love the sparkles, the mattes, the foils that colour products have. They draw the eye and can spark up the best conversations. As a beauty specialist my relationship with makeup has changed drastically in 2020. I'm not able to swatch and play with clients as I usually would and it takes some of the magic out of being able to share with people what makes cosmetic products so special. I do have to mention that I have a new found appreciation for the ability to express myself with makeup now. Having to wear a mask whilst I'm at work has made lipstick redundant and I didn't realise how much of an effect that would have on me. I have small lips anyway so lipstick doesn't last as long on me but I really do miss being able to apply my favourite lip combos, making it compliment my eye and base makeup. Eyes have become my new focus and I've found that is the case with other customers and colleagues too. I've found a new love for tinted moisturisers too because of the masks. I find they sit better throughout the day with the humidity and friction that comes with mask wearing. I miss being able to wear a full face and it last throughout my days but the plus side is now I have become a queen of the natural glow look. Recently I have been inspired and excited by Urban Decay. The new Stoned Vibes and Ultraviolet palettes have been on my shopping list. At the moment I am all about glow and these palettes give me that. Such a unique formula in the Stoned palette and such a great colour story for something so shimmer heavy. I love the backlighting technique they use with the glide on pencils to transform your eyeshadows (using the colour pencils as a base on your lid before applying you shadows). It makes you feel like you have endless opportunities with just some pencils and an eyeshadow palette. B. I'll start with what I dislike as I like to get the negative out of the way first. This isn't a specific person, brand or influencer but it is very relevant. I really dislike influencers that try to make too many rules for makeup and gate-keep what looks good and what doesn't. Makeup has no rules and is used as a means of expression, enhancement and as an outlet of joy. Moreover, I don't enjoy the falseness of some online figures that overly edit their appearance or make their life look 'perfect'. I enjoy transparency, creativity and innovation. I also dislike when these figures don't disclose brand deals as it takes away from the authenticity of the reviews/posts. A specific influencer that I am not a fan of is Jeffree Star. His past behaviours speak for themselves and I do not condone them. I think his personal brand (himself not the cosmetics) is rather hateful and judgemental. As someone who has immense talent and creativity I wish he was more inspiring through his uniqueness and some kindness. He becomes too involved in other people's business (from what I have seen) and makes remarks that are not always from a good place. I just wish the negativity would slow and his brand became a more joyous space.
A. I love influencers like Sophdoes life, Samantha Ravndhal and makeupbytammi. These influencers are honest and trustworthy whilst also being insanely talented. Tammi has her own brand that brings out the most gorgeous products that can be accessed by almost everyone, she is talented beyond belief and is extremely underrated. Samantha is open with her life, her troubles, she is brutally honest about products and if they are worth it. She has been in the business for a while and knows what she's talking about. She shares useful information for anyone wanting to start in makeup. I also appreciate that she doesn't have perfect, glowing skin and is honest about that. Soph is amazing because she feels like your mate. She is down to earth and really knows her audience and makes good business decisions because of that. She can make fun of herself and is uniquely honest about it. I love these ladies because of their honesty, their talent and their down to earth nature.  I believe a makeup guru is someone who has been playing and exploring with makeup for a fairly significant amount of time (2+ years) and knows a lot about makeup, techniques and what can make a makeup look look amazing.   These are people that are very dedicated and are truly in love with makeup. They enjoy every part of it and want to explore new techniques, products and brands.   At one point this was the setting spray that everyone and their mum used. There was a time where you couldn't watch a reviews without the MAC Fix+ It was used before during and after makeup. It was the spray that people used to turn eyeshadows into foils.   I loved the fact that it could be used in every part of your routine and it has a spritzer that covered a large area.   I think it was probably the amount of people that had it and the versatility of the product.   Creating foil shadows by wetting your brush with the setting spray made me so excited to try it   Graphic liner and it has been for a while   The first person that really caught my eye using graphic liner was anythingforselinas on instagram   I never really watch tutorials as I find them quite boring so I usually look at a photo and work it out on my own. I don't mind short tutorials that summarise everything quickly. Selina used to do short tutorials on how she would go about deciding what type of graphic liner she'd do for that day which were great. She even made one showing what to do if you mess up the symmetry or shape which was incredible.   I like short tutorials when it comes to makeup, styles like Pat Mcgrath's on Instagram are captivating and don't take up too much time. I love watching reviews as opposed to tutorials, I can watch these for longer periods. I like to see if there is a learning curve with a product etc.    I think star makeup artists give brands a bit more personality. Most prolific makeup artists have been in the business for a long time and know tricks with formulas that you could never even imagine. I think they are often forgotten about by younger generations who see star makeup artists as the makeup influences that got popular on YouTube and Instagram.   Pat Mcgrath coming out with her own line made me so excited, her sets were so unique and you knew everything was going to be top quality and would last you a while. If Pat would use it I trust it.   I think it is a harmonious collaboration. I think it feels like a logical extension and encompasses the branding of Chanel. However, it did not feel innovative or extremely exciting in comparison to other brands' summer collections.   I think the muted tones really didn't encompass an inclusivity that I like from brands. There could have been deeper and richer tones that could have complimented darker complexions better. I had a few of my deeper toned colleagues say they probably wouldn't choose these colours because it would look more grey on their complexion. I think incorporating a few more richer colours could have made it a bit more daring but would still align with elegant beauty. I think by not including warmer tones made the collection have a disconnect between the collection and the reality of Nambia. It is a beautiful country filled with so many colours and people of all different complexions. I feel like they could have celebrated this place by incorporating more than just the muted tones.   I like the incorporation of the graphic eye with the graphic prints of the set. Keeping the base simple and making the eyes pop suits the edgy style of Dior.   I think Peter Philips brings an enthusiasm and buzz to Dior. His choice of focusing on the eyes was perfect timing for the current climate with mask wearing so common. Again, I believe this is a harmonious collaboration and doesn't stray too far from the Dior branding. It feels inherently Dior. It is an extension of what they already have with a hint of drama.   It is cool and edgy but it does lack some of the colour I expect and want from a summer collection. I think this could have easily been a winter collection. I think things like shimmers can be so beautiful in summer collections because of the light and playfulness that spring and summer encapsulates. I think the graphic loner could have been stepped up by using a pop of colour or shimmer to really elevate it.  Inclusivity! I think making sure each collection truly enhances every skin tone, type and shape is so important. No one wants to look at a collection and think 'there is nothing there for me'. Having a range of undertones and styles can be so important. I understand the muted tones were that specific target but the deep warm oranges of the dunes could have been used in a better way that would have drawn more people to it. I remember swatching these on my colleague who has a deeper skin tone and they looked nice but she felt limited in her choice because the paler and cooler tones really didn't compliment her too well. Nambia could have been explored using all of the landscapes, the cities, the villages, the wildlife. I think it was a fairly narrow collection that really could have had those pops of colour that people want to treat themselves to.",Guru,
382300,Rebecca,Schell,rebeccaschell503@gmail.com,"My best friend would describe me as someone who follows their dreams and their passions, and makes things happen for them self. This may be a cheap answer, but I feel I most embody Sephora. A store where all the brands gather, one aisle is Dior, the nest if Fenty, then Natasha Denona. I am always wanting to try something new and explore new brands and products, so I wouldn't really say I am particularly loyal and married to one brand. I just just as excited for new Anastasia Beverly Hills as I do new Urban Decay, and I have a BALL dabbling and mixing and swatching new shades as I spend a solid forty five minutes in a Spehora when I came for a specific thing and found it within three minutes of walking in the door. I love a Sephora because it's just a place to enjoy, experiment, and explore with the medium I love, and for that reason I feel the most embodied by it. Eye shadow! I personally feel there is nothing more fun to play with and mess around with than eye shadow. It was one of the first bits of makeup I was allowed to use as a teen, and I rannnn with it. I got a cheap Ulta rainbow pallette with about 30 shades of all colors under the sun, and I couldn't help myself. I went :sparkles:crazy:sparkles: and it became my thing in school to always have the best and boldest eye makeup. I started my real love of makeup during this phase, from watching OG gurus like Michelle Phan to learn how to use my rainbow pallette for good and not to look like an actual clown strutting down my junior high school hallways. Well, for starters there was a huge chunck of time this year I spent hermetically sealing in my apartment and I wasn't going anywhere or seeing anyone. New York was a little scary and a bit of a ghost town for about three months, and I didn't honestly touch my makeup aside from a few nights when I'd still try practice getting my winged eyeliner right on my very deep set eyes. I main focused on my skincare and getting my hormonal acne under control and starting tretinoin this summer. But as regulations began to lift a bit and we were allowed to go out more and do more, makeup started to come back into play and I learned how miserable it can be to wear a lot of foundation and blush under a mask. This year has really changed my relationship to makeup, I go less places, see less people, and wear much less, and I can't even remember the last time I was in a store dedicated to makeup for that sole purpose. But, the cosmetic aisle is still the first place I hit when I go to target or a CVS/Walgreens, and getting into TikTok and catching up on YouTube makeup drama and tutorials has really helped me keep my inspiration and love alive, even if I'm not getting fully glammed out on a regular basis to sit at home with my cat. I am really inspired by the TikTok user Mikay Lanogueira, she is this super down to earth girl with a heavy Boston accent who does these crazy glamorous looks and transformation while talking to you like an old friend. She is someone who is often bullied and hated on in the comments and by other beauty influences because she doesn't look like your typical beauty influence, and self-described as not being a classically beautiful girl. She's short, like 4'11, has dark hair and a bit of a goth aesthetic sometimes, hasn't had any work done, and refuses to push or sell or pair up with any bran she doesn't actually believe in. Her vibe is much more 'let's get our makeup on so we can go to the bar, grab some beers, and watch the game' than it is 'we're getting dressed up to go clubbing.' I love her down to earth personaility and how she is so against the exclusivity some people try to put on makeup. She wants everyone to have a good time, be included, and look good doing it. I sometimes see her video working with Nars for their new foundations pop up as the sponsored ad I regularly get on TikTok and I am so proud of her every time I see it for getting that brand deal and making her way into the Luxury space. I love the passion, knowledge, and enthusiasm that makeup Guru's bring to the table. Growing up, my mom was in the Air Force and barely touched makeup, so she couldn't really teach me or fuel the passion for makeup that I had in any kind of real way because she didn't know herself. A lot of my friends when I was in that 12-13 age range were already good at makeup and it was intimidating to ask for help or for them to teach me. Enter YouTube and the first beauty Gurus who swooped in like big sisters and taught me technique and how to pick colors and apply things for the best and longest lasting results. Those early videos felt like finally finding other people who not only shared my passion for makeup, but also took it a step farther. They also seemed like such experts and role models, and they just wanted to help everyone learn how to feel beautiful in their own skin. 
 
Though on the other hand, now a days it seems like anyone can have and grow their platform, and occasionally the cream doesn't rise to the top, the rotten bits do... The amount of drama and scandels and shady behavior and business dealings of some of the influencers these days really detracts from the love of makeup and brings out so much pettiness and drama and hate to a once safe space. There are people who will bash brands and ingredients in one breath, then tell you about their sponsor who has the exact same ingredients in their products in the next breath. There is also sometimes an environment of so much hostility in the comments of some of these people that is left dangerously unchecked, too.  When I think of a makeup guru, I think of someone who lives and works in the makeup industry who shares their knowledge about products and techniques openly and for free. Makeup is such a personal thing, and a  lot of experience just comes from trial and error and lots and lots of practice. Even if a person is not a professional makeup artist who went to school for it and has had clients for dozens of years etc., if they aren't able to communicate and impart those insider secrets well, then I wouldn't consider them a Makeup Guru, they'd just be a professional. A Guru is someone who has demos, recommendations, a style and technique all their own, and is able to communicate all of these things in a friendly and encouraging way. 
   A lot of the fun of following along with 'get ready with me' videos and makeup look tutorials is getting that feeling that you are hanging out with a friend or sibling who is being caring and supportive while offering you makeup advice and tips. When I think of a 'basic influencer' I think of someone who is a big self centered and only cares about their views and subscriber count, and shills for sponsorships they don't believe in or use themselves. A basic influencer might show a tutorial on how they do their eye makeup because it really compliments their specific eye shape and color, they show you how they make them self look their best, not how you can look your best. A true makeup Guru does what works for them while telling you how to make it work for you. Instead of saying 'I have brown eyes so I'm using this color eye shadow because it looks great on me!' a makeup Guru might explain a bit about color theory and help the viewer find what would work for them if they didn't have brown eyes too. It's less about particular brands and products, and its certainly not about the gurus themselves or how they look and how we all need to aspire to look and do our makeup exactly like them to be beautiful, it's much more about guiding people on their makeup journey and having fun and trying new things along the way with a supportive community standing behind you.    I started seeing the Natasha Denona Sunrise Palette all over instagram when it first dropped, then the youtube videos showing off different looks with it really sold me. 
   $65 for an eye shadow palette is a little expensive for me, but this sunrise palette had exactly the right colors for me and that really motivated me to buy it no matter what the price point. It's pretty rare to find a palette that is mostly full of reds, corals, and pinks, but those are colors that really suit my specific eye color. I have bought entire palettes just for one or two reddish shades in the past, so to see so many reds and different tones of red was very exciting for me.   The particular makeup Guru who pushed me over the edge to buy this palette was Mel Thompson on youtube, she has a great video swatching all colors, giving information about the palette and how it compares to other Natasha Denon palettes prices and size and colors, she tests each of the pigments for how the blend together and how long they last, on top of showing a really cool eye look tutorial. 
   I love how she really goes step by step in showing her process for creating an eye look. Nothing is sped up, she doesn't say ""now I'm gonna finish the look and be right back!"" and disappear and reappear with the completed look without showing us how she did it. Mel tells us exactly what shade she is using, what brush she is applying it with, and she is describing her technique the whole way through. She says helpful little things like ""I'm applying this darker color to the outside corner of my eye by first tapping it into place, then sweeping it into my crease to blend."" It feels like this isn't just a tutorial for how she did this particular look, but it is setting you up for similar success by giving you her technique, teaching you how to blend and add in new colors, and how to finish off looks in clean and professional ways. It's not just 'I did this eye look, doesn't it look so good??' it's ""Here is a look, here's how to recreate it, here are skills you can use to apply to any number of looks, not just this one."" 
   My current favorite makeup looks at the moment are ones that are super inspired by the fall season. I love the transition to darker colors palettes for eyes, dramatic purple and terracotta lips, and blush that really mimics the look of being out in the cold and getting rosy chill-nipped cheeks. 
   I see people on TikTok and Instagram throwing out recommendations for their favorite new products every season, and this year I've really been struck by all the burgundy and purple I've been seeing. I've been  inspired by Katy Jane from the_makeupservice on instagram and Melissa Alatorre on YouTube to create new dramatic looks lately. 
   I love Melissa Alatorre on YouTube because she is so friendly and great at communicating her process and how she achieved her looks. She is stunning, so everything looks good on her, but she is also deeply knowledgeable and good at teaching others how to achieve the best looks possible. She is someone who is so supportive, even if you don't go out and buy the exact same products to use as she is using, she teaches you how to make what you have work and the technique and application that will give you a good result regardless of what brand you are using.  
   Now that I am a bit more advanced when it comes to doing my own makeup, I really find myself enjoying short little makeup videos on TikTok that more give me inspiration than a hard set of rules to follow. I don't really need my hand held through the process of putting my makeup on, and I've heard the tips and tricks before by now. I just need inspiration sometimes, so it's nice to see these condensed, minute long videos showing a look and a bit of the process of creating that look. I even like the new trend of people playing  audio clips of important social issues over top of their video putting makeup on to spread awareness and information. I feel like I'm able to learn something new and potentially important while also getting makeup inspiration. If I need a longer, more detailed tutorial for something or for a very specific look or technique I want to try, I know YouTube will always be there and have that kind of content for me, but for now I just enjoy playing and learning for myself and creating my own looks using just a bit of inspiration from some of the insanely talented people on TikTok. 
    Even though we may never personally know a star makeup artist, the ability to recognize a name and a face on a product makes it feel a bit more personal, and like you could potentially be supporting someone you like (or not supporting someone in the space that you dislike) by purchasing something from their collection with an established brand. Especially with gurus who show you how they use the products, do swatches and demos and tell you all about the product, it gives the viewer who connects with that guru a little extra incentive, and cements the desire for this new product or collection. It's definitely a marketing tactic, like putting a friendly, trusted name/face on a brand to make people want their product  over the competition. I can't even begin to tell you how many people I know go crazy over Fenty products just because they like and want to be like Rihanna, or have a little piece of the feeling Rihanna inspires in their own collection.  
   I liked the ColourPop x Jenn Im collection, I felt like the collection looked like something Jenn Im would come up with, having nothing but bright and playful, shimmery colors. It didn't feel like ColourPop made a new collection then went looking to slap an influrencers name on it to sell products, it really seemed like it was developed collaboratively between the two. It took the trusted ColourPop formulas and packaging and put a friendly name/face I could recognize and trust on there as well. It felt like ColourPop believed in Jenn and her vision and really worked with her to create something that felt like a blending of the two, unlike say the Too Faced and NikkieTutorials collab where it kind of felt like Too Faced slapped Nikkie's name on a sub-par, dodgy quality palette that didn't really seem to have much influence or inspiration from Nikkie.     I think the collaboration really adds some artistic vision and direction. I honestly don't know very much about Lucia Pica, or her makeup skills, but I can tell from that video alone that she really understands color theory, what works and blends together, and how the collection should flow together. Just from hearing her talk about her vision and the passion she showed, I would be excited and feel compelled to check out what the actual collection ended up looking like. I typically wouldn't buy a Chanel eye shadow palette, because I know they only have 4 shades and for the price I'd rather get more variety for my money, but after hearing the inspiration for the collecetion and  seeing her talk about how the shades should play off each other, I am now more inclined to think about the potential the four shades have to make multiple looks and be a little more dynamic than I originally thought. 
   I would just want more from the collection in general. Every shade feels very carefully thought out and and you can tell time went into picking shades that will all work together and play off one another, but I am still someone who wants to be able to create a look for any occasion with a single palette, and these limited color palettes and small shade variants don't excite me as much as something that has a bit more variety and potential for experimentation and exploration on my end with the product. I look at this collection and think I could create something that falls into Lucia's vision of muted tones and desert hues, but I don't really think I could push it very far beyond her vision to stretch it into more of my own vision. It's less meaningful and interesting when I can only color within the lines I've been given rather than create freely on my own, you know? 
   I think, again, the concept and vision is very unique and bold. I liked that the graphic eye look was used on so many models with so many different eye shapes. As someone with very deep set eyes who has to use eyeliner techniques for hooded eyes to get the right look, I really enjoyed seeing the artists having to compensate for different eye shapes, depths, and lid sizes without compromising the overall vision. I think Dior really needed a strong makeup look to compliment their fashion, and  Peter Philips really helped give them a bold direction to go in, but I kind of feel like that's where the partnership ended. Like, the Dior makeup was just a tool for Peter to use to get his desired look rather than something he collaborated with Dior to make to achieve this vision he had. 
   I am already obsessed with Dior, and I think from what I've seen Peter Philips is very talented and has a vision and concept all his own, and he is able to execute that vision really well. In general though, I don't really think the two brands need or really utilize each other that much or that well really. It seems like Peter just needed foundation that matched all the models, and a dark, graphic eyeliner, and he didn't really need those things to be from Dior. If it wasn't for a Dior show, and he wasn't specifically partnering with Dior for this, I wonder if Dior products would even have been his first choice for this. It didn't feel like a marriage between the two brands for me, and as such I don't really know how much was added to the Dior brand besides a cool look for a show.  
   I didn't actually feel like I needed any of the products shown in the video to recreate or make a similar look to this. I think the collaboration showed Peter Philips vision well, and allowed him to create the look he wanted, but it really feels like any old product, even a cheap  drugstore product, could really replicate this look well. I personally love love LOVE all things Dior, and it doesn't take much at all to convince me to go buy another makeup product from Dior, but this really didn't inspire me at all to give this collection a look since it could be so easily replicated with things I already have. There's not much very new and exciting with the products themselves, it's just the way Peter is using them that is interesting, and I could apply that technique he is using without having any of the products he is using.    
  The whole time I was watching the video, I was waiting for them to show what the actual makeup products would look like. When it comes to buying new products, actually liking the final product is the most important thing. A little goblin voice in the back of my head just goes ""Is it pretty? Okay, then we buy it!"" ""It's ugly? Then no! Pass!"" Lucia can talk all she wants about her inspiration and her vision and really try to sell me on her concept, but if I see the end result and I don't like it then it all means nothing to me and I'm not buying it. I enjoy seeing the real world inspiration that went into creating the palettes and highlights and whatever else, but if you don't show me the end result of the final product it just feels like words. As a makeup enthusiast, I'm obviously most enthusiastic about the makeup! If you don't show me the makeup, I'm gonna be sad! lol",Guru,
198815,Sophie ,Lee,buddhaness@yahoo.com,"“You’ll never meet anyone like her... Madam Sophie is exquisitely one of a kind.” Pat McGrath for her creative artistry as self expression. Her quality formulations that speak to attention to detail and thoughtfulness. 
Fenty beauty for the inclusiveness and celebration of diversity, for having her own strength and point of view, and new innovative formulas/packaging that’s exciting and fun. I would miss the ritual of self care, creative expression and beautification. It’s almost like a zen relaxing meditation I get into. The slow pace and taking time to celebrate embodying the divine feminine essence, and practice the artistry of adornment like a modern geisha. I don’t wear and play with makeup on a daily basis as I used to before since a large majority of the time I am still staying at home as much as I can as a protective measure from Covid.
But I also newly joined Boxycharm for the last 4 months so have thoroughly enjoyed receiving and trying new makeup and skincare in the mail. So I am still very much learning about new brands and creating new looks with my new discoveries. I’ve also been taking more intended care of my skin... using more of my facial masks, serums, products on a regular basis. My skincare routine is amped up, as a conscious choice of self care while I’m at home.
My makeup affinity has deepened even though I may not use them as often, because my sense of appreciation for them as a source of my pleasure, creativity and transformation is solidified. And I’m definitely still watching a ton of makeup tutorials/reviews/unboxing videos in YouTube. I haven’t tried either brands so I can speak to the quality of the products but I noticed and admired Wayne Goss and Selena Gomez’ Pure Beauty launch collections.
I loved the universal timeless approach from Wayne. His color stories are gorgeous and they embody the quality and elegance I look for.
Pure Beauty’s entire collection was packaged beautifully and I liked seeing fresh formulations that were lighter/sheer that is preferred in Asian like more of a wash/ tints. Both brands feel very genuine and authentic to who they are as individuals, and what they value. A. I love and appreciate watching Jeffree Star, Michele Wang, Mel Thompson, Kathleen Lights, Hello Catie on YouTube. Their unique feel and personalities, their candidness and thoroughness of reviews, the looks they create are fun to watch.
B. So over the spilling the tea, toxic “beauty community drama.”  Feels very highschool and irrelevant. I don’t engage with any of it because that’s not why I care and love makeup.  I'm not using a strict barometer for ""make-up gurus"" i watch. If I like their makeup looks, tutorials, their videos/content, and I feel their passion and some sort of expertise with makeup, presentation, reviews... then I will watch. Many are makeup enthusiasts / vloggers who may not have worked in the beauty industry. Some are artistic professionals... i like a good mix and variety for new ledge and inspiration.   They all have a level of expertise, thoughtfulness to their channels/content. Generally I like the more lowkey, relaxed, stylish creative channels. They have something unique or their own style, own vibe, own voice that's distinct, memorable & real.   I heard Hello Catie review on her YT channel about the entire range. She swatched every color so I had a general idea of which colors I'd gravitate toward.   I loved how you described the texture to be velvety and I liked the look and feel of that texture. It's one I didn't have in my collection so I wanted to add it. I like that it had a luxurious feel to the formula.   I appreciated how thorough she was and swatched the entire range not only on her arm but on her lips. I also really trust her opinion, as she is discerning and share similar qualities I look for and or like in a product. So I like watching her because she's in Taiwan so she has access and knowledge for leading asian brands/products I don't hear about here in Los Angeles.   She mentioned how her natural lip texture is pretty deep and the formula was able to smooth out and give her a velvet lip feel, and still comfortable and beautiful to wear.   My modified subdued foxy look.   I saw the Foxy Eye Life look a la Bella Hadid on Alexandra Neele's channel in April. It looked like an easy, but dramatic look to try so I did.   Alexandra explained and demonstrated/showed it well in the video about how to achieve the look. So it made trying /learning fun and easy. I had a clear idea of what I was going for.   Technique and really able to see what it's doing up close. But still far enough to get the full look. Also which tools and tricks of the trade, tips along the way to make the look last longer, easier, lighter... etc.    I appreciate the collaboration because the MUA adds their own unique voice / interpretation / point of view to the beauty space. Esp with their professional background and artistic achievements, I would imagine they would be thoughtful to innovative performance formulations, sensitive to color stories, quality and longevity of the collection.   Hmmm... I can't think of one that wowed me that's been a collab. This is more skincare but I was impressed with Victoria Beckham's collab with Augustus Bader. But I'm continually inspired by Pat McGrath's new collections and growing range.   Alludes to Chanel as a progressive, open-hearted global brand that is willing to nurture and cultivate next generation of creatives and evolving the business of beauty towards hopefully even more sustainability and kind collaborative future.   Seeing the different phases and processes while creating the collection. We've now seen the source of inspiration. I'd also love to follow along in the lab... through different formula developments... a peak behind the scenes of the making... like how jeffree star/shane dawson took the audience on a journey of the creation of the conspiracy palette & collection.   I really liked the SS21 eyeliner look and can see myself trying it, as it's something different that I haven't tried in its simplicity. I liked how the liner didn't look perfect... it looked like a thick doodle (relaxed) while still being minimal and modern.   It adds a level of creativity and freshness to the CD brand. Having a creative onboard makes the corporate beauty brand more human and relatable. Often I find with mega brands there's more distance, especially with the old marketing approach of exclusivity.   I am curious to know more about Peter Philips... his story, his design approach, process, and the different phases of putting the color story/ collection together. I feel beauty lovers are such fans and would love to be engaged and peek into more behind the scenes, especially from major brands so they feel more personal and relatable.  Share with me who Lucia is... why I should care or fall in love with her, beyond her artistry. When I look at the instagram now... it's very generic posts in the sense of beautiful fashion / beauty shots that are more for visual pleasure and on the surface level. I'm emotionally not invested in who she is. I don't know how she thinks, why certain colors resonate...etc. More transparency in the creative vision for the brand and how's behind it is interesting to me, more than the ""image"" brands portray.",Guru,INFJ
399578,Melissa,Duhalde,melissa.duhalde@gmail.com,"My best friend will describe me as someone dynamic, sociable, always positive.
She also will describe me as a passionate about beauty and fashion. I am very often at Sephora, my favorite shop - to discover new brands and products !
And I love doing shopping with my friends but alone too ! I love Givenchy, Chanel and Guerlain for what they represent : feminity, luxury, quality, french how-to and craftmenship.
For example, Louboutin make-up products ( as you can see on my photo) are more than just products , they are luxury objects;  you can wear them as necklace and keep them even when the products are finished. I love this feature and this timeless side that these luxury make up brands represent.

But, I love other brands too different from the traditional ones, like Fenty Beauty for example for the values the brand brings, as I am a woman of color : diversity, self-confidence, acceptance.
This brand takes into account all the women in their diversity and their particularity. Moreover these kind of brands are closer to the new generation in their communication and the messages they transmit (in my point of view). 
Besides, there is someone who embodies the brand, the customer can identify to the founder and so to the brand easier. I would miss make up so much above all because I am a make-up addict ! 
I would miss lipstick because when I wear it I feel more confident, more feminine.
I would miss foundation too, because as I have some imperfections/ scars coming from my acne ( when I was adolecent ), foundation allows me to hide these spots which bother me and embarrass me !
I would miss concealer too, as I live in Paris, I am busy, I run during all the day and sleep too little, so I have dark circles. Moreover, concealer allows me to hide my scars too, I use it before my foundation as a corrector. Yes 2020 is a very special year ... 
During the lockdown, I admit, I used much less make up. I was at home with my family in this unprecedent situation, we did not know nothing about the future, even for the coming days .. So I used more skincare, with some ""me time"" using mask and scrub, testing all my new skincare products, eye patches, etc
I also take care of my hair, doing lots of haircare. I tried to find different means to relax, so I used lots of products for bath too ( bath bomb, relaxing shower gel etc).

BUT since the end of the lockdown, I have started again to use make up when I go outside to see my friends and even for some video call.
I feel better when I am wearing make-up, more confident and more feminine. As Gabrielle Chanel says : "" Beauty begins at the moment you decide to be yourself""
As some restrictions are coming again in France, lunch, brunch, tea time and breakfast are the new dinner so I wear make up for each exit out ! I have bought no transfer makeup due to the mask.
Otherwise, I have the feeling of letting myself go and that everyday is sunday, so no make up day ! I am not used to that and do not want to get this habit. I love what Louboutin creates in terms of packaging ( cf my previous picture), each product is a true jewel.
I am really interested in the luxurious caps for lipstick of Givenchy and Guerlain which allow customization - which is central today. Customer loves cutomization and the possession of a unique object.

2 luxurious french make up brands have drawn my attention: LA BOUCHE ROUGE & LE ROUGE FRANCAIS.
The both have produced lipsticks refillable and responsible, with clean formulas, good for the consumer & the planet and made in France.

LA BOUCHE ROUGE creates handmade packaging, refillable, in leather. They have created a mascara with a packaging in glass, with 99% clean formula and 100% recyclable. This brands allows too to create your own lipstick color coming from, for example, your favorite scarf or dress.

LE ROUGE FRANCAIS creates lipsticks from tinctorial plants, the color are coming from plant pigments, their tagline sum up well their identity"" the future will be vegetal"" 
Morever, their packaging is a worlwide innovation because it is biobased, made from castor oil and of course refillable ! A. What I love about make-up gurus is that they have a vision, an identity; so you can easily identity to them if they correspond to your values ( for example Rihanna and her vision of diversity in beauty). They are not expert in that field but launch products they need or they think which are missing. They are ""nearly"" like us and use makeup for everyday look. But they are celebrities and we want to reproduce the same look, get their tips.
Some of them are experts, some of them were make up artists before so they are experts and are really relevant (for example Charlotte Tilburry). They know how to teach and educate so it is cool to follow their tuto/ Step by step and learn how to use make up like a pro.
Some of them were bloggers and learnt with time like Huda for example, so she shares on social media all her tips, funny tips sometimes, habits and easy way to make up. They have built their community with the years and build their notoriety.

B. I can not say I hate some features/particularities about make up gurus ... But for example, with the sponsored partnership it is difficult to know if the influencer really likes the brand and the products or if she appreciates it and just want to share some novelties and makes it for money ... The honesty is undermined even if they all confirm that they are talking about only products and brands they love... the doubt is still here. Some of them work with so many brands... that is why it is really important for the brand to choose well the influencer because she will be associate to it ! It is better when the influencer uses the products during some days and gives her opinions after, with some proof ! Some of them prefers to use this method showing the use of the product on the day to day thanks to the story on instagram. I think this kind of method can remove the doubt of the honesty for the scpetics.
That is why micro and nano influencer are becoming more and more important and more used by the brand.
Morevover, some influencers are making videos on makeup, fashion, lifestyle etc and so they are not as expert as make up artist or influencer with a make up bakground like Djulicious in France.  Because they have lots of followers and a huge influence.  Moreover, they have a huge knowledge of this category. They are making videos, tutorials, stories about their daily life including the use of make up. 
   For me, it is the number of followers, their notoriety and so the number of colloboration / sponsored partnership they have   I hear about the product in the youtube videos or in Instagram stories coming from make up gurus   The fact that the products are new, sometimes collector, in limited edition etc The make up gurus explains  and shows how to use it, shows step by step look. When it is a limited edition, it is the fact to get something collector.   The fact that these make up guru show the final results of the product motivates me. I can imagine how it can be on me. It was easier to project myself.   Yes, as explained above, the fact that they show a specific application, some look (step by step and final), techniques or tips allows me to project myself in the use of the product. I buy the product with some precise ideas on how to use it. 
   Even if it is Halloween period and I love seeing Halloween make-up from make up artist ( julien rol or marion cameleon) or make up addict, I do not wear these kind of make up in daily life. At the moment, my favourite make up look is ""Automn look"" with warm color.   It is a look which is coming back each year at this time. The make up guru I follow are Sananas2106, Jen.peekaboo, _the_dollbeauty, Djulicious, Sandrea26france, petitboutdesoleil, prettyusmu, loanne_lo   I learn about how to create it thanks step by step in youtube videos. I firstly watch it entirely and then I use the method "" play and ause"" to reproduce it correctly   When it comes to exploring and learning about new looks, I prefer youtube videos. The other formats like instagram stories are shorter and better to present the products, making unboxing, or quick make up but not a full look.    These partnerships are important because a star make-up artist is associated to a brand, he/she  is the face of the brand when the brand is not embodies by a celebrity. Moreover, they know really well all the products. They are known and even well-know in the make up and beauty space by customers but the media too, it gives legitimacy to the brand and build its reputation. These star make up artists are respected for their art and their techniques. 
   A collaboration that wowed me is ""Divine Rose"" by Pat McGrath which is embodies by Noami Campbell. The collection is just amazing, the products, the color, the universe and the egerie who is just an icon of fashion but of Make up too ! The collection is just AMAZING ! The other one which inspired me is Dior Backstage, especially with all the shades for the foundation. For me, it is a new chapter for the brand, which translates a new vision, it is a collection dedicated to the young generation and I recognize myself well in it. The range is really complete, with all the essential, which allow a quick make up or a more sophisticated.   She has her own vision, with her inspiration so she will brings her vision of beauty to the House. She seems to be creative and imagines products/ color from a lansdcape, an universe. 
 For example, for the SS20, she went in Namibia to find the inspiration, which has made a unique collection , because the trip was unique. She made some connections with the photography universe wich is an other art too. So, she seems to have an arty eye/vision. 
 
   For me, in the video/the collaboration the products are missing ... we see the inspiration, the universe, the environment but not the translation in the beauty world ... 
 I am a make up addict so I love products ... It is interesting to see the results of the collection in the video. 
 It is the same for the instagram account: it is really arty, with lots of pressional pictures but some pictures of the products are missing (in my opinion) 
 I think it is difficult for the young generation to recognize themselves in this kind of communication, abstract ... we see the imaginary of the collection but not the products. It would be possible to stage the products and in that way keep the arty vision. 
 
   I think that Peter Philips has really well understand Dior Couture Universe and translate it into the make up world ! For example in the video, we see the use of the make up collection during a Dior Fashion Show   He succeeds to highlight the brand as a whole making the link between the fashion house and the make up world. He really explains well the use of the products, the properties / features of the products and the effect he wants to produce.  The fact that he is staged during the fashion with the products accentuate this impression of unity between fashion and makeup.   Nothing is missing for me in this collaboration ! I love it ! He seems closer to his community thanks to video, tutos , how to on his instagram account. We also can see him in photo or in some IG Live. He also promotes Dior IG filter, which is really appreciated and used by the new generation. He seems to be more modern than Lucia Pica in his vision and his communication.  I will tell them to accentuate the communication on the products, the look who can reproduce with the products, more tutos, more vidéos etc

The communication should be less abstract, more in ""real life""; it could be great to make the link with the fashion house too in order to see the brand as a whole.
In the video of Peter Philips, he was filmed during a fashion, in ""situation"", showing the products used and the effect he wants to produce. He talks about a special look with the focus on the eyes and which techniques he uses, which shows his expertise.

Moreover, in his instagram account, we can see him in photos, doing some tutos, using some IG filter ... for me it is more appealing, he seems more modern, using the new way and tools of communication. He seems closer and less inaccessible, less ""arty"" and less abstrac, more dynamic while remaining professional !",Guru,
308996,Andrej,Shevchenko,cchevy@gmail.com,"1. I would like to see answer to 3 questions: What is Elovena? What can I do with Elovena? How can I benefit from Elovena brand? 
I think it's pretty much there. It resonates yeah.


2. in red marker:
from oats grown in Finnish fields for nearly 100 years
Our oats are grown in unique Finnish conditions; pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world


3. What's missing is more benefits for consumers, community or the environment by the brand. 1. It looks tasty! I like the photo with bowl. I wonder how many calories are there in one serving, as you mention energy. First thing I look is for amount of sugar. I feel the packaging on the right does not appeal to me, it feels like it's meant for women exclusively. 
2. Free small sample. Maybe buy small samples pack of each, then I can order the ones I like. I usually order online. A discounted package with almond milk maybe (buy 1+1).
3.  Biolife - https://biolife-poland.com they have similar mix of oats 
Verival - https://www.verival.at/english/ some new I have tried
Provena - https://www.provena.fi/pl_PL/tuotteet 1. Why sea salt in the front of the packaging? Salt is salt imo, and coming from the sea doesn't make a diff to me. I watch my salt intake. How many calories? I would like if this is a biscuit that's not too hard to chew.
2. The texture is most appealing to me, and the golden finish. I find that biscuits are best when not too soft or too hard to chew. These look like they're perfect, I just can't make a purchase when I see the salt in the text and in the picture. It's a big no-go for me.
3. Not really important.
4. Free samples, order small quantity to test, free small test gift with my order in supermarket/online store. No salt advertised.
5.  Green Cafe Nero (https://greencaffenero.pl) and also Costa Coffee (https://www.costacoffee.pl) sell similar round biscuits in store. I buy such biscuits when ordering coffee to go. I would not know the brands in supermarket, I never looked at this section. 1. Great, I love pasta. I would like to try this. Why this shape? Is this macaroni? Can I buy spaghetti?
2. This kind of pasta is new to me. I can make the usual recipes I do, but it won't taste the same. Maybe include a recipe, as this is something new and I don't want to bother thinking how to prepare it. Your best recipe.

I feel these are the competitors, when it comes to pasta. They are available across online stores and I have ordered before. 1. I've been looking for this a lot lately, for something similar to Beyond Meat products. How many calories per patty? I would love to try it! The oat balls are something new, I haven't seen such product. Showing it in salad, I never though about it like that. Would buy. How much plant protein is in it?
2. Most products I've seen mention ""Burger"", as most of time people would buy to make burgers. I do that. Maybe consider the name ""Burger Oat Patties"".
For the oat balls = ""Oatballs"", just like Meatballs - no need to use two words. Or maybe ""Oat Vegeballs"".
3. The amount of protein per serving, also description of the taste. A recipe or link to recipes online would be also good. There is not much to chose over at the moment in the stores I shop. I buy and throw away similar products, so it has to be good the first time. I'm looking to replace meat so I want a similar-to-meat experience. But I know my friends who are vegan are not looking at this at all, they don't want meat-like flavours at all. 
4. Mleczni Bracia - http://mlecznibracia.pl/portfolio/burgery/
Also Beyond Meat burgers started selling in burger shops, and I heard soon they will be in stores. There is not much competition and products in this category, but the hype is real. Everyone wants to try them. 1. Maybe more focus on the product, and less on the girl. She could be probably placed in a smaller version. I really want to see the product in detail.
2. It's not compelling (to me as a man), feels like it's made for women exclusively. I would think it's targeted to women. In the second packaging there is salt, which is a no-go for me from start. Why advertise salt to people who want a healthy snack? Second packaging, what kind of seeds? If mix maybe write ""Seed mix"".
3. Healthy, Snacks, Women.

p.s. I'm an experienced marketer and have been working on similar brand projects with 50+ clients so far. 1. There is this brand that makes healthy instant breakfasts, snacks and meat substitutes. You can order samples online to your door, and see what you like. 2. The burger patties and oatballs. 3. Make sure to cover the most popular online stores that sell healthy food.",Goldilocks,
308994,Kamila,Mitka,kamila.mitka@gmail.com,"My initial reaction was that Elovena is healthy, conscious choice for my health. In this place (initial introduction) I would probably prefer to see it in more visual way – like infographics, photos, shorter sentences. I like the story about brand naming and the story behind product itself – it makes Elovena more familiar with nice connotations (like long summer days) The sentence 'And we really do live for oats' – this is really strong one, and it makes me think that people behind Elovena brand really know everything about oats. I would probably mark 'long summer days' too, because connotation is really pleasant. Im curious what products the brand can offer. My initial thoughts: Elovena products are fast, easy way to provide healthy meal in your daily diet. Normally im not using instant products (I prefer regular oats instead of instant, even if it needs my time to prepare it in the morning) I find the packaging a little bit oldschool, and it makes me confused – it's not traditional oat, because it instant, and the 'quick meal' message is not clear for me. Maybe more present-day packaging would help.

https://sante.pl/kategoria-produktow/platki-zbozowe/ Usually im not really into biscuits but it seems like a nice option for snack (eg when you are in travel, or too busy to have proper meal). The main advantage for me, that you can eat them everywhere. This is very nice that they are free from wheat and palm oil, so I would like try them for sure. I like the selection of the flavours, but usually when im on my way somewhere (and really don't have another option) im choosing something with cocoa. It's also interesting that there are salty options.

Patties and balls on photos doesn't look like something tasty. Also i'm not buying products like that, because I prefer to make it at home, or go to one of the vegan restaurants (there are plenty of vegan places in Warsaw, and they are really good) 'Patties' looks more like burgers for me, so maybe I would try them to compare them restaurant burger. 

I have no idea if there is something competing in Polish supermarket, but for sure I would compare it to those restaurants:

https://www.facebook.com/vegemalpa/
https://vegelabb.pl/ I find it a bit chaotic – I really like plain pastel backgrounds and product photos, but I have mixed feelings about the illustration. 
The logo itself if in my opinion gives enough retro touch to design, so for me illustration is not necessary (or not this specific illustration) 
I would probably pick it up anyway, because I would be interested in the product. 
1. huge logo 
2. nice typography 
3. mixed feelings about illustration Elovena is a nice brand, that can make your life easier if you want to make healthy choices and you don't have time for cooking. 
 I would definitely try beetroot pasta / carrot pasta.  Good luck! :slight_smile:",Goldilocks,
300172,Jan,Ambroziewicz,jan.ambroziewicz@gmail.com,"1. I try to make reasonable choices when it comes to food, cooking and eating - simple ingredients, no heavily processed foods. From this perspective, the message sounds very compatible.

2. Make better food choices for you and your family and to bring back the joy of eating.

3. There's a lot about the company's mission, but there's little on what does that practically mean. If you do natural and sustainable cultivation, bring some more examples about how you do that (ie. sustainable cultivation, no pesticides, fair prices for agricultors, crops grown locally, etc). If there's no processing - tell a story of how the oats are processed and delivered to consumers. 1. Quite positive, if the added ingredients (spices, fruits) are actual fruits and spices (ie. dried) with no added sugar & preservatives, then it's a very reasonable choice for a snack.

2. I'd look at the packaging – if the sachets were made of paper or other non-artificial, easily biodegradable (or compostable) material, it would make a big difference against other similar products, packed in full-blown plastic bags. The second factor would be the nature of other ingredients (no sugar, no palm oil, no preservatives).

3. NaturAvena & Sante – NaturAvena seems more focused on eco&bio-oriented customers, Sante is very common when it comes to oat and grain snacks. The both kind of overpackage their products. 1. Very positive, a huge plus for the paper wraps.

2. If it looks like on the photo - no plastic packaging.

3. In my case it's not important, I eat and tolerate wheat products quite well.

4. Again – biodegradable packaging, no added sugar (aside from naturally occurring sugar in dried fruit), maybe a low-fat variation as well.

5. Tastino, Belvita, Sante – all of them oat-based or with oats as a significant ingredient. They all have added sugar, though. 1. Great idea, an interesting alternative to wholegrain, wheat or spelt pasta. Would make a great addition to a weekly meal prep, when you generally prepare the same meal for each day, but look for easy tips and tricks to make them just a bit more diverse (example: chili con carne as a protein base, plus rice, pasta, grains as carbs).

2. Given the reasoning in point no. 1, I'd love to try it. No additional arguments or qualities needed.

3. I'd say Lubella (Polish brand) in the wholegrain wheat department, and pasta brands from Lidl (they have their own branding). Otherwise, it's hard to think of any others, as it's quite hard to get non-standard pasta in smaller stores and local supermarkets. 1. Outstanding! I eat meat, but I try to reduce the amount I consume. For now, the alternatives have been mostly soybean products, like tofu.

2. In English I would consider ""Oat Burgers"" as an alternative name, a little bit more compelling than ""Patties"". It also suggests a way to prepare them (as in between two buns). Talking with some of my friends, I found out that when it comes to meat alternatives, suggesting a name for a product that actually belongs to meat products (like burgers) makes it easier for people to figure out how to make them a part of a proper meal, and in consequence, more likely to buy those products.

In Polish, naming it would be a whole new challenge :) ""Kotlety owsiane"" or ""Burgery owsiane"" & ""Kulki owsiane"" would describe the product nicely, and wouldn't sound funny. There's no good alternative for the word ""patty"" used in this context.

3. I already would love to try them.

4. In local supermarkets it's not easy to find plant-based meat alternatives. In my case, it would be mostly Polsoja and a number of tofu variations (smoked, natural, with herbs etc). 1. Plain, pleasant, traditional, simple. I like that the design emphasizes the logo, and also combines plain graphic elements with photos and illustrations. If someone would describe me this as a design idea, I wouldn't say that it's possible to pull it off so nicely.

2. I'd say yes, but to be able to give a full answer - I would also consider the materials the boxes would be made of. As mentioned before – if this design were combined with paper boxes and no plastic wraps, it would increase the likelihood of me buying it greatly.

3. Plain, natural, simple. 1. Hey, there's this new brand of oat products, a lot of great stuff: oatmeal, cookies, but the most interesting part is the meat alternatives. Another thing we could try to eat less meat but still hit our macros! 2. Patties and balls – those definitely are the most interesting ones, as they can become part of a lunch or dinner, and replace meat. 3. Think about the full picture - the ingredients, the packaging, the availability. Warsaw is in the TOP 10 vegan-friendly cities worldwide (according to many sources, like The Guardian and HappyCow) so think of non-standard ways of distributing your products - also in bars and restaurants. Also, especially when it comes to meat alternatives, position the products as easy to prepare and introduce into people's diets, even for people that don't do much cooking.",Goldilocks,
300173,Alicja,Peszkowska,alicjapeszkowska@gmail.com,"1. My initial feeling is that this is a lot of messaging, maybe too much, for a claim like that. They want to underline: the tradition, the etymology of the word (also a kind of ""tradition"" behind the brand), then paint this entire lavish picture of the nature that they are close to, and then they don't say again that they love for the oats. Suddenly, the focus is on helping you make food choices and joy of eating. I think it is too much and they should focus on one message, they are trying to address too many things at once.
2. I would go for the first and the third sentence. I like that the brand is Finnish  - Nordic but not Scandinavian, there is something wilder in the popular imagination about Finland than in the case of other Nordic countries. I like that. However, the etymology of the name seems confusing - why is it not in Finnish or in Latin? I am glad they liked it as a name but I don't know why it would be so important to explain it exactly. I think the unique Finnish conditions is something both believeable and important for people. They definitely want to eat something healthy that has proven itself throughout the centuries. Food is a complicated topic - why introduce this notion in the last sentence without being able to give any examples HOW it is complicated and HOW Elovena can help? I'd skip that since now it sounds like an empty promise.
3. How is the company that produces the oats? Is it huge and what all the Finnish people eat? What is its contribution to the local community? Is it a family brand? I would go for these practicalities and draft towards painting a picture of a Finnish brand that is both simple and focused on quality. 1. Gluten-free and instant is a little bit at odds with the entire ""traditional approach"" to food which has been so emphasized in the previous messaging. I think it calls for some kind of an explanation. Is it still healthy? Why did you decide to make this product?
2. I am not celiac and do not really believe that gluten as such is bad for you unless you are allergic. I think I would like to understand what other than a consumerism fashion would prompt you to produce this kind of a product - I am not saying it just for the sake of criticizing, as someone who cares what I am eating I would simply like for the company to provide some kind of an explanation so that I feel like I understand and know what I am choosing and why. I prefer non-instant and non-gluten free oats. I have 5 minutes in the morning to actually cook them myself. I would appreciate good and nice, nutritious porridge recipes that tell you what you can provide for yourself (vitamin and nutrition-wise depending on your body needs).
3. a) płatki ryżowe błyskawiczne - Kupiec. Kupiec would be your Polish competition and they do not only have a non-gluten wheat based option but also rice and millet instant porridges. b) your other competitor will be Sante, especially their Fital line - mostly without gluten, instant and marketed as a product for ""fit"" people. c) your other competition would be, I believe, either big FMCG brands like NESTLE (they do have products for everything and they spread into all the shops easily) or simply people who would buy those at market places, with no packaging. Just compare with products available online from Auchan, one of the biggest supermarkets in Poland. They are not all ""instant"" and/ or ""gluten-free"" but there is a plethora of products available by many brands - from the biggest ones, through local, Polish ones to the wannabe ""eco"" ones with plain packaging: https://www.auchandirect.pl/auchan-warszawa/en/groceries/flour-sugar-pasta/careals-muesli-bran/c-13153?callback=true 1. I am not really a fan of sweets and biscuits most of all. I would much rather have an apple or a sandwich and then a proper dessert (like a pie or ice cream) than have a sweet snack during the day. I would like to know how many calories one biscuit has and how nutritious it is (what are all the ingredients and what percent of them is natural). The lack of palm oil is a big plus.
2. I like that they come in savory as well as in sweet flavors. I like that they are packed in comfortably small portions. I find it appealing that no palm oil was used to produce them. 
3. It actually is not. I feel like the ""gluten-free"" food hype is slowly fading. If you are not celiac, wheat can be vital for your good health and is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Not to say that the whole grain isn't healthy of course.
4. I would try these biscuits firstly, out of curiosity and secondly, have I been looking for biscuits to eat. I need to be honest though - biscuits is not something I frequently shop for.
5. One of the brands I have previously mentioned, Sante, produces healthy wholegrain biscuits of different tastes much like the Elovena ones (https://www.sante.pl/sklep/Ciasteczka-Cookiss-jeczmienne-z-chia-i-konopia-300g). They also emphasize the fact that their cookies are wheat free, they don't say anything about palm oil explicitly but they use rapeseed oil instead as well. Another brand you should be looking out for is Rossman's Enerbio brand (https://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Ciastka/enerBiO-ciasteczka-owsiane-175-g,168403,8417), they do use palm oil though. Last but not least -  Belvita biscuits are also popular but the least healthy in this group. They use palm oil, sweeteners and chemical substances. Their product isn't gluten-free either (https://cabas.pl/index.php/miody-przetwory-oleje-artykuly-sypkie/ciastka-slodycze-i-przekaski/herbatniki/belvita-breakfast-red-berries-ciastka-zbozowe-50-g.html?partner_id=181). I think you should mainly take a look at Sante's products. 1. I have eaten a wholegrain pasta maybe twice in my life and I do believe it tastes worse than normal pasta. I usually try to limit my pasta consumption instead of replacing it with a healthier version. I would be open to buying the wholegrain pasta product however, I don't think I would like to try the veggies-enriched one. Why not use fresh vegetables instead? It seems to me like unnecessarily overcomplicating things and I believe that the simpler, the healthier.
2. I think I would go for wholegrain pasta if I was dieting. There are undeniable benefits or eating this kind of pasta. A cool recipe which would include this product would help too - I simply don't really know how to prepare good meals with it (normal pasta dishes with this kind of pasta taste a little ""off""). When it comes to the other product - I would probably not buy it unless I would have tried it somewhere first and really liked the taste. Convincing restaurants or canteens to experiment with this product to get people used to eating it and then - cooking with it - would be a step to recommend.
3. Finding competing brands for this one was a challenge as I don't really buy these kinds of products. It seems like these products are out of mainstream and to be found only in specialized ""eco"" shops. If Elovena manages to put them on supermarkets' shelfs - that would most definitely be an achievement :) Below I am pasting products I have found in some of these shops. None of them really consists of any veggie flavors. I think one might be able to find those in the shops somehow, however, I have never come across them before. All of these products have a plain, simple ""eco"" design 1. Since I am a vegetarian, I would definitely try out those. It is always a challenge to correctly balance your meals and I have troubles digesting many of the legumes. Again, I would probably go for the classic original - I prefer to add spices myself and create them by mixing fresh veggies and spices instead of having them prepared for me.
2. My initial reaction is to vouch for the ""Oat Patties"" instead of ""Oat Balls"". I believe Patties refer to meat-substitutes as much as they do to the meat itself. I also just don't really like the ""balls"" reference ;) In Polish, I would suggest the name ""pulpety zbożowe"".
3. I don't eat meat and have never bought any so you wouldn't have to convince me to try those. Of course, the more natural the ingredients and the more basic the taste (I would prefer to add veggies in myself), the better. I always like to see products like this in a full meals' setting rather than standalone. What would you suggest eating them with? Why choose a ready-made meal over one you can prepare yourself (if not for the lack of time).
4. I have not really seen many of these products and no brands come to my mind automatically. Soy or tempeh balls/patties are very popular however, I have not seen oat patties in my local supermarket. You can find those made of lentils and chickpeas but not the oat ones. I have pasted a few of those for your reference below. 1. I like that it looks fairly simple and ""classic"". I really like the logo (although it does slightly look like Polish Wedel). The colors are very informative.
2. I would pick it up but would prefer if the colors were substituted with white + just a hint (like a stripe) of other colors. I would basically make it look a little less supermarket-product-conventional if that is what you are going for (I am not sure what is your target group exactly, but it could be a little more hipster. However, this design might appeal to families)
3. Simple, Classic, Informative 1. I would emphasise that it is a Finnish brand with a long tradition. And I would say they make pretty simple, healthy snacks which are wholegrain based. 2. Oats! I would actually really like to try them. Oats are something I eat anyhow and almost everyday. Buying a veggie patty would be my second choice as I am a vegetarian and always on a lookout for healthy additions to my diet. Biscuits would be on my list after that (especially if someone offered them to me first) and pasta would probably not make it there at all. I am just a fan of the classic, Italian pasta. 3. Pay attention to the language on the packaging and make a careful decision about where you want to sell your products exactly (local shops vs. eco shops & big supermarkets). I would encourage some places to cook/serve meals with patties and pasta to make people used to the taste without them having to purchase the products first.",Goldilocks,
198793,Natasha,Back,natasha_back@hotmail.com,"I love what Elovena is all about. I love that it’s been producing for nearly 100 years. I love that they are proud of their heritage and their country. I love that they feel part of the fabric of the family. 
The most compelling part of the text for me has to be about producing for nearly 100 years - they’re sticking to their routes but obviously changing with the times. Proof that their products must be loved and rates highly. 
I also love the way they describe how their oats are grown. You don’t get much better than that. 
What more would I like to know? I’d love to be told the range of products and why families love them My initial reaction is really positive. I don’t follow a gluten free diet and usually don’t choose gluten free products as I have a silly perception that they’re less tasty, yet these look and sound delicious and nutritious. The range of flavours is excellent and something for all the family, including weekend chocolaty treats! The packaging is really attractive, as is the photo. 
I’d definitely give these a try and my kids would love the variation of flavours. They often get bored with cereals so the fact there are lots of flavours keeps it interesting. 
The only brand of gluten free porridge I could find on the shelves was Moma porridge. My initial reaction is they look quite nice and a healthier alternative to chocolate biscuits. I’d probably give them to my kids or have them in the cupboard as a treat rather than have them daily. Again, the range of flavours make it appealing, the fact you can have sweet & savoury.  
The fact they’re wheat free doesn’t affect me but would be great to give to my kids friends when they came round if I wasn’t sure about any allergies. I have friends who have cut out wheat recently who I know would like these. My initial reaction is one of caution and curiosity! It doesn’t jump out at me as something I’d normally go for but the flavours on offer would tempt me to give it a go. I think that I’d definitely want recipe suggestions with these as I’m not sure what I’d serve it with. The fact it’s high in fibre is great and a real attraction. I like the colours of the pasta in the photos, I think the kids would love to try the pasta, especially younger kids. I’m unsure of the packaging. I think it would be nice to have clear packaging in order to see the colour of the pasta. I would definitely love to try these. The fact they’re high in protein and meat free is very appealing. 
I’m unsure of the name. Oat patties sound a little bland and oat balls make it sound like a snack or a sweet thing. They look a little like falafel - do they taste similar? 
Again it would be great to have a recipe card or something to suggest how you can serve them, ie with dips, salads, in wraps with coleslaw. They look delicious but I’d want to be told how versatile they could be. I imagine they’d be great in packed lunches too. 
I scoured the shelves in my local Waitrose, Tesco & Sainsbury’s and couldn’t find anything similar that was made of oats. The alternatives I found were Waitrose Vegetarian Aubergine & Feta Burgers and Vivera 100% vegan pumpkin & sweet potato burgers which boasted of being a high source of protein. I love the packaging although I’m not sure how well it would appeal to the UK’s more diverse population - it’s very white and wholesome! The colours are lovely, it has a great feeling of nostalgia and tradition. The text on the packaging is simple and I love that you can see an image of the product. I would definitely pick all of these products up to try. 
Three words that I’d use to describe Elovena’s packaging would be traditional, wholesome, nostalgic I’d describe Elovena to my best-friend as a healthy brand which produces a great range of oat based products, some of which are gluten free. I’d tell them about the conditions in which the oats are grown and that the brand has been established for almost 100 years.  I would almost certainly pick the porridge oats above everything else with the biscuits a close second. We have porridge almost everyday in our house but I try not to have biscuits in the house too often, they don’t last!  I think Elovena would sell really well in the UK. I’m not sure whether the image of the girl would be a hold up for different ethnic groups. It may be seen as too white? It doesn’t bother me but just a thought",Goldilocks,ISFP
300168,Justyna,Obara,justyna.obara@gmail.com,"A.D.1
My initial reaction was quite positive. I like the feeling that it's traditional Finish product, still produced in an ""old way"". I think the text meets the needs of many people who base their diet on healthy and well proven food choices (food that our grandmas would eat ;)).

A.D.2
I would underline: ""Our oats are grown in unique Finnish conditions; pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world, together with long summer days"". It's compelling because it sparks the imagination and proves it's a natural, ecological and healthy product.

A.D.3
""A range of product"" sounds quite interesting and I would love to hear something more about them :) A.D.1
Me and my gluten-intolerant self loved it!

I wonder whether the name should contain the word ""oats"" as it's still not very popular source of protein in Poland. Some people may also associate it with ""tasteless"" oatmeal and choose vegetable options over it. What about referring to Finish origin of the product instead or combining both qualities? I'd rather name them ""Finish Vegetarian Patties and Balls"" or ""Finish Oat Patties and Balls"".

A.D.3
You've already cought my interest though both descprition and graphics seem quite traditional and a bit boring. I'd like to know how oat patties and balls can be serverd in different, creative ways.

Sante's soya cutlets
Galeria smaków's wegetarian dishes
Ikea's vegan balls A.D.1

A.D.2
Yes, it is. I'm sure it would caught my attention and make me wanna try it.

A.D.3
traditional, natural, fresh/new A.D.1 I'd tell there's a new Finish brand producing snacks, pastas and other products out of oats coming to Poland and it all  seems healthy, tasty and worth to try :blush: A.D.2 I'd probably buy snacks first. They seem like they can be both tasty as ""normal"" sweets and healthy. There's huge variety of so-called healthy snack available in Poland but many of them contain a lot of sugar and preservatives, when other are simply not that good. Also, I'd wanna try oatmeal as good breakfast option for vacations and travel. A.D.3 I think it's a really good product that have a huge chance of succeeding on Polish market. You should keep in mind though that there's a ""hype"" for healthy products now. I consume a lot of them but have problems recalling most of their name. So, it's important to establish brand visibility and differiantiate yourself from the competition. Good distribution may be crucial here. For instance, I sometimes buy these millet cookies in Biedronka that you cannot buy anywhere else. And because of that, I think about them as ""cookies from Biedronka"", not an actual brand they are.",Goldilocks,
300169,Katarzyna,Kramnik,kasia.kramnik@gmail.com,"1. I'm kind of allergic to the over-the-top advertising language like ""we really do live for oats"" or ""bring back the joy of eating"". I understand the intention, but I prefer a more easygoing approach. I'm generally distrustful when it comes to the ads of healthy foods, because it often turns out they are not as healthy as producers claim. But the mentioned geographic conditions actually got me - I wouldn't think about it when picking my oats at the store. It's really convincing.

2. Like I mentioned, this would be the part regarding the conditions of crop growth: ""Our oats are grown in unique Finnish conditions; pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world, together with long summer days. This allows us to produce a range of nutritious, simply natural oat products.""

3. I would like to know if other ingredients included in Elovena products are also local and if there are sugar-free options available (if all products are sugar-free - even better). 1. I'm always laughing when oat products are labelled ""gluten-free"", because it's obvious to me, but apparently not to everyone :) I really like an oatmeal in the morning, so my initial reaction is positive. The flavour range sounds really tasty.
2. I'm all for good instant oats, so there's only one more thing that interests me before trying - the percentage amount of fruit and the amount of sugar per package.
3. Elovena will surely compete with Nestle (NesVita) and Lubella (Fitella), they are sold everywhere. 1. Very positive - I'm intrigued by the flavour selection and impressed with the ingredients' quality.
2. I like that rapeseed oil is used instead of palm oil and that there are no other grains that oats. Savoury flavours are practically unseen on my local market, so I would be tempted to try all of them. 
3. It's not the first feature I would be looking for, but a nice-to-have. I believe people with gluten allergy or intolerance will pay close attention to this factor.
4. I'm only wondering about the price range - how it would compare to competitors. If Elovena wasn't much more expensive, I would certainly give it a try.
5. The main competitors would be: 
- Belvita (Mondelez)
- Ba! (Bakalland)
- Be Raw by Ewa Chodakowska (Purella Food) 1. I'm intrigued and would love to try it!
2. I've never tried oat pasta and never seen such unique flavours (I have only tried pasta with spinach, dried tomatoes and squid). I love trying new products if they're healthy, easy to cook and have a high potential of good taste :) 
3. This is going to be a little harder because I usually buy regular wheat pasta, if any, but I believe these brands provide a range of ""healthier"" options:
- Lubella
- Barilla 1. I'm very enthusiastic towards a healthy replacement of meat in my menu, but I bet my boyfriend won't be that happy about it.
2. I think it's a good name since all other Elovena products are made mainly from oats. Changing the name or avoiding the word ""oat"" wouldn't help in my opinion.
3. The only deciding factor in this case would be the price. As long as the patties and balls aren't more expensive than the same amount of average-priced meat - I'm all in!
4. There aren't many options of plant-based meat replacements available in the stores around me, although there are many bars and restaurants with vegan food. The only ones I can think of are: 
- Sante
- Naturavena 1. It's colourful and attention-grabbing, the logo looks traditional, but there's a modern feel to it. I like that the background colour differs depending on the flavour of the product. However, I feel a kind of mismatch between the painted figure at the front and a photographed product in the back.
2. Yes, it is compelling to me because it presents - more or less - how the product looks, but not in a cheesy way. There is not too much text and I get all the necessary information without distraction.
3. Colourful, informative, distinguishable 1. ""I found out about these Finnish oat products, they look pretty interesting. I hope I'll grab them in my store to try... and that the price won't kill me."" 2. I'm very keen on trying the meat alternatives and the biscuits, especially the savoury flavours. I'm always in for something healthy and easy to prepare or ready to eat. 3. I believe the market for Elovena will be not necessarily the mainstream snack shelf or breakfast products, but rather the healthy/fit food areas. It'll be easier to reach potential customers because eating healthy is not a common thing in Poland and there's a specific group of healthy-food-oriented customers who follow less common paths when doing shopping.",Goldilocks,
300170,Michał,Guzik,sixer@poczta.fm,"1. My initial reactions is that through this project Elovena is first oat brand that I thought about for longer than a minute. It totally resonates with me, especially origin of the product. When it comes to Finland first thing I think about is pure, unique nature - good base for food.
2.  FINNISH - like i wrote earlier, 100 YEARS - seems like Elovena has long tradition/experience in making oats products and they don't change much in terms of food processing, NUTRITIOUS - that's what I'm looking for
3. That's all I need to know from theoretical perspective :) I'm curious how it taste 1. Positive but closer to neutral. I feel like I already know such products and I'm wondering how Elovena is different from them.
2. I like wide range of flavours - few of them makes me want to try them out! This key visual doesn't resonate with me as I prefer more solid consistence of porridge and when I do porridge for myself (lately I don't) I always try to make it as dry as possible.
3. I think maybe Melvit, Sante and Nestle Nesvita. All of those looks like quite similar product to Elovena. 1. Those looks delicious, convienient and healthy! I'd like to try them out.
2. It appeals to me as a alternative for sweet snacks which I'm trying to fight with. Might be a good solution for me
3. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not allergic to anything and I eat gluten
4. If those biscuits are quite similar to those that are on market I guess price might be a factor
5. Belvita and Sante are most popular. There are a few brands that looks like home made/ home packed there might be a competition as well. However I cannot recollect those brands 1. Wow, might be a hit (at least for me). I feel very excited to try them out.
2. Flavours seems very interesting and delicious. Also looks like great alternative for regular pasta which seems boring comparing to Elovena product
3. I believe there's not many mainstream brands that have similar pastas in offer. Maybe Lubella. All of different brands are the one available only in shops with ecologic food and those are small brands that I don't really know 1. As a person who eats meat but thinks very heavily on switch to vegetarianism it sounds like perfect solutions. Also in comparison to previous products this is the one I don't really know and it's 100% new thing for me.
2. In english it sounds relevant and gives clear idea of the product. Polish name might be hard to coin as polish names doesn't sounds as ""sexy"" as english ones
3. As I mentioned in point 1 it sounds like great alternative for meat. Warsaw for example is ranked as third city in the world as most ""vegan city"" (right after Berlin and Los Angeles). Sounds like great target for this product espacially for people who are thinking about the switch.
4. I think I don't know any - seems like Elovena might be a pioneer in that area 1. To be honest I have mixed feelings about it. It looks really traditional and conservative. I feel a bit like its part of soviet propaganda (girl with grains). From visual point of view it also reminds me polish chocolate brand ""WEDEL""
2. I don't consider myself as a person who buy things by packaging (I know, nobody does ;). It would definitely catch my eye and if I'd like to buy poridge I would take it, read the ingridients and if the product is as you say it is I'd buy it.
3. Traditional, Simple, Vintage 1. I think I would. Some products are really new on Polish market. From this survey I also know your products are 100% natural and I'm not so sure about it when it comes to competition products. It's enough to recommend it :grinning: 2. Oat balls/meat. Main reason: never had one, never heard about one and it's something I was really that exactly aim my needs 3. I wish you good luck :)",Goldilocks,
300171,Emilia,Obrzut,emilia.obrzut@gmail.com,"1. As I work in branding myself, I was really in awe of the naming. The word itself is really beautiful and I had no idea about its meaning - I'm sure for Finnish speaking people it's even more alluring :) I think the explanation of the name really stood out for me, especially as the name is over 100 years old. Beautiful, clever and timeless!

The second thing I paid attention to were the conditions which the oats are grown in. This for sure is based on my environmental interests, but also on the local context. I live in Poland, one of the most polluted countries in Europe (yay!), where even organic produce is probably not as organic as somewhere else ;) For us, Scandinavian countries were always synonyms of ""clean"", ""eco"", ""conscious"" and ""reliable"", but also ""expensive"" - yet Finland is the country we know the least about. At the same time, while living in a Smogland, I'm also a citizen of Warsaw - amazing, forward-thinking city with a great deal of conscious, eco-friendly projects in food (one of the best cities for vegans in the world!), beauty and fashion industries. I'm probably a part of the group that pushes that change forward and creates and spreads such trends (I am a founder of two well-known projects in that department), but still, we have to remember, it's a big, capital city that surely stands out and the rest of the country is very different. Regardless, for the past 2-3 years, the big shift into more conscious choices is visible nationwide and supported by big media, so even well-known companies are shifting towards more conscious solutions - or, at the very least, communication :) I think being a Finnish brand might be a big advantage for more conscious buyers - for the rest, it's all a matter of the price.

Frankly, to me the last paragraph feels like added by the marketing team at the very last moment - it doesn't seem consistent with the rest of the statement, that says a lot about the brand, for me is a bit pushy and has all the catchphrases condensed into one big suggestion - healthy, you, family, joy. I found it brazen and in clearly visible opposition to very relaxed and convincing paragraphs above.

2. ""unique Finnish conditions; pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world"" - as we don't have it here and, as mentioned before, it's an essential part of the Scandic stereotype we, Poles, share. Agriculture is a big part of our industry and national heritage, too, yet we're not that ""clean"" and ""eco"" - even for ourselves.

3. I'd love to know more about the production process - as much as the growing seems super eco and sustainable, I'd be really happy if it turns out the technology and packaging are take care of in a similar manner. I'd be very curious about the correspondence between the original concept of the company and now - how the tradition is being preserved, what changed and what - like the name - has proven to be timeless. 

I'm sure the above is important for me personally, because thanks to my job I pay attention to the communication not only of the product but the brand itself. Regarding the product, I'd love to know more about the range, its nutrition values, what the products do and don't include (are/aren't vegan, have/don't have preservatives, refined sugars, etc.). This is the basis of the communication of many Polish foods right now, I'd even say that these are the most emphasized features (everything is being advertised as gluten-free here, even soap - I kid you not!), probably also among your direct competitors. 1/2. My absolutely first thought was: Ok, INSTANT, probably not as nutritious as regular oats. Then it was followed by questions: How do they make it nutritious? Do I lose quality by gaining more time? Frankly, I haven't found a satisfying answer. I also noticed that the product presentation does not convey the same values as the brand's introduction - here, the bigger impact was put on the ""tasty"" and ""quick"" features (the word was included) rather than on ""healthy"" or ""natural"", while for more aware customers, ""quick"" often equals ""more processed"", thus ""unhealthy"".

Also, looking at the picture on the left, I was wondering whether fruit and nuts on top are included in the recipe or added to the readymade product - I know there is information provided, yet I'm confused whether the fruit is whole or is there a pulp, same with nuts - whole or shredded, etc. Usually, in Poland, there is a disclaimer ""Serving proposition"" next to a photo that has more ingredients added solely for the photoshoot.

As I am probably one of the more aware customers, information about nutritional value would be crucial in making up my mind about trying the product. I would like to be reassured that a quick, readymade meal is as nutritious and healthy as something I'd made from scratch. 

3. a) Kupiec - one of the biggest grain-oriented brands in Poland. I've attached two variants - the orange one is more common to get and more ""mainstream"" (the name ""Cos na zab"" suggests and an easy, quick snack, there is information about fast prep provided there too), the brown one is introduced as the healthier one. Yet, both have information about high fiber level and the brown one - also about being natural, not including sugar and lactose, being rich in magnesium and phosphorus.

b) Nestle - very popular, but also considered convenient, not healthy choice, usually associated with corporate workers, not paying too much attention to their diet, but not having too much time either. Usually, in the supermarket, it's situated between instant puddings and jellies, far from the healthy corners :) Yet again, there is an additional disclaimer about having less sugar and more fiber (I bet it's relatively new).

c) Inna Bajka - relatively new, more hipster, niche brand, with eco-packaging and natural ingredients in the brad's DNBA and communication. In their recipes, they use rarer, unusual ingredients (goji, chia, buckthorn). They're available in bigger cities and eco chains. They also have a selection of lunch meals (grains with vegetables, curries, etc.), but yuck, not the tastiest choice ;) 1./2. Yay, this is what I meant about the previous products - this time I git all the information I need. Rapeseed oil - how nice, local product, very popular in Poland, I personally remember the surroundings of my hometowns covered in yellow, so that's a great association. I know that they are: healthy, wheat-free, palm oil-free, full of fiber and filling. I also read ""no saturated fat"" even though this is not the exact information provided - the power of a healthy suggestion worked on me :)

2. Conscious ingredient choices - no wheat, no palm oil. Great, natural substitutes of the aforementioned. I trust this product instantly.

3. Not much, I try to avoid unhealthy food, but since (as I mentioned earlier) even soap is considered gluten-free these days, I try not to overreact :) Yet I'm sure that for many it will be a great advantage, even if only on the mind, and not health-related levels.

4. I am absolutely positive I'd try these after such an introduction. Maybe I'd need more info about used sugars, but, as other information about the ingredient choices were provided, that would be a nice addition. These days this information is probably essential to parents, as sugar really has bad press here (the obesity level increased rapidly among children and teenagers), so in my opinion, it might be good to mention it too, as it might help them in making the decision.

5.  a) Belvita - the ultimate hegemon, I think ""belvita"" became a synonym of a healthy breakfast cookie and when you search for ""wholegrain cookies"" in Polish, Google suggests ""wholegrain cookies like Belvita"". Very distinctive packaging (yellow box) and similar to Elovena's values in the communication (healthy, filling, energy boost). I'm sure this will be the direct competitor.

b) CooKiss by Sante - I think the product itself was designed to be Belvita's dupe, but I'm mentioning it mostly because of the producer - Sante is definitely the biggest and most renowned Polish brand in the wheat and grains department with big distribution network. Not fun fact: the founder of this brand has just been accused of mobbing and sexual harassment. 1. Instantly caught my attention: it can increase my fiber intake - wow, what a smart pasta! Using that suggestion is indeed super smart, as here (among my inner circle, sooo full of kale ;)) pasta is usually associated with gluten, body fat and laziness.

Second thought, after a while: oat based pasta? Interesting, I might give it a try!
I was a bit confused about the paragraph describing the number of vegetables per serving - as I hate broccoli, I wasn't sure whether it's in all vegetable varieties or just in one, but that's just a matter of redaction because I could figure that out by looking at flavors.

2. Maybe it would be nice to explain the decision to include oats in the pasta recipe, as it seems quite unusual. I'd be interested in knowing the benefits of oat-based pasta.

3. I don't think we have many vegetable-infused pasta brands, so I'm going to introduce some of the products considered healthy in the gluten feast department :)

a) Lubella whole wheat - one of the most popular Polish brands, that decided to incorporate whole-wheat types of pasta into their offer few years before the healthy boom :) The packaging is very similar to the regular line of products, but there is a visible info of the increased number of minerals and energy (whatever that means:)). This type of pasta is available everywhere - from big supermarkets to local grocery stores.

b) Niro - frankly, this is one of the few, very niche, very eco brands, available mostly in eco grocery stores or online. The brand is Polish, the reach is relatively low, there is no advertising and there is no brand itself - just a product. I had to check to find out the brand's name - I think no one is familiar with it, you just go to get that eco pasta without telling one brand from another.

Additionally, you can find vegetable kinds of pasta in selected grocery stores in bigger cities - mostly imported, Italian brands. 1. Initial thought: oh okay, they're going to have big competition on the Polish market. As I stated, vegan or plant-based diet is very popular here, not only among hipsters and/or in Warsaw. The best vegan blogger, Marta Dymek, cooks her meals on national TV morning shows, while her books are selling in hundreds of thousands of copies. You can go to one of Krowarzywa's (amazing name having few meanings in Polish: krowa - cow, zywa - alive, warzywa - vegetables) super popular restaurants to order an amazing plant-based burger and biggest retail chains (Biedronka, Lidl) are competing with Vegan Weeks. So, it's not going to be an easy ride.
Second thought: who is the recipient? A dedicated vegan / vegetarian or someone who wants to cut his current meat intake? The first paragraph indicates the latter and if so, in my opinion, it should probably say more about the similarities in taste or nutrition - Poland is a land of kielbasa (sausage) and pork chops - and if you want to convert its admirers into your patties, tell them that it's LIKE pork chop, but better (healthier).
Third thought: only one type of patty (oats and potatoes)? Probably because we're spoiled by the existing brands, this suggests an offer for beginners. You can easile find a recipe for 100 types of plant-based burgers on Polish blogs, so people who eat it won't be that impressed.

I'm sorry for my harsh judgment, I'm sure it's a great patty (looks like that!), but please keep in mind that Poland is surprisingly vegan-friendly and this particular type of product is not a novelty here.

2. Well, it's probably a matter of translation, as far as I know, the word""burger"" is controversial, but still, it's common to call all vegan patties that. Krowarzywa burgers' names are based on the main ingredient like jaglanex (millet-ex), cieciorex (chickpeas-ex) and so on. Maybe a unique name, as you can create some as the main ingredients don't change, would be a good idea.

3. I already use such products, so probably I'd buy it if it was available in my grocery store (usually they're available in bigger chains). I think I'd try the spicy BBQ, as regular patties are more ""earthy"" (emphasizing the actual taste of the grains). Also, I think this one has the biggest potential, as you don't think about putting millet on your BBQ stove, so this name suggests a great alternative during BBQ parties, especially in the summer season. I like that, as I miss the BBQ experience, and now eggplants seem like the best of the very few vegan options.

4. a) Dobra Kaloria - available in Lidl, previously known for its selection of healthy, grain- and nut-based snacks. Very hipster in terms of product branding, but the brand itself looks different - see the image attached.
b) Well Well - available in big supermarkets, looking very much like Polsoja - the most popular vegan brand in Poland
c) Vitally - available in eco groceries, not vegan

You should also take a look at Polsoja and Bezmiesny - leading brands on the meat substitutes market. The first one is well-established, the latter - young, but very dynamic in its growth. They don't offer burger patties yet, but in my opinion, it's a matter of time. 1. Beautiful, but also ""old school"" - in my country it's a risky business, as this type of aesthetics is associated with the communist era and propaganda posters. Also, comparing to competitors, clean in terms of providing the nutritional benefits of the product - I'm not sure if that's a good direction.
2. I would definitely notice it - it has distinctive colors and super pretty logo. Yet, I would definitely need more information about the advantages of choosing that particular product.
3. Nice, traditional, ""mom-friendly"". 1. ""What a beautiful brand, you'd love the logo! Thank God they're from Finland, I'm sure it's super healthy - like, REALLY healthy, not Polish healthy. Their product selection is very inclusive, from quick meals to healthy meat replacements. I'm sure you'd like to check that BBQ patty!"" 2. The BBQ patty - looks least processed, the photos made me hungry, I'd be super happy to participate in a BBQ like in good ol' times. 3. First and foremost - I'll keep my fingers crossed :slight_smile: Please do an intricate research of the packaging and communication of your direct competitors and development of the healthy food industry in Poland, as it has been very dynamic these past few years. In terms of snacks and quicks meals it might be easier to convince customers, but when you try to conquer the vegan market - please be aware it's failrly developed and you will not be the exciting novelty.",Goldilocks,
300180,Daria,Wilcocks,dariawilcocks@gmail.com,"1. It's quite lengthy, I think that the messaging could have been delivered in a more concise and engaging way. However, not to be too negative about it as overall I would personally resonate with the ethos behind such a brand; natural, quality, healthy. 
2. Our oats are grown in unique Finnish conditions; pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world, together with long summer days. This allows us to produce a range of nutritious, simply natural oat products.  This sentence makes me feel like there's no other brand out there that will taste the same. It's also compelling to me, as it quite clearly portrays a brand that will by default by healthier, supposedly with organic growing methods and without the use of nasty chemicals to mass produce.
3. I'd like to know more about the people that work for Elovena, what's their lifestyle and other interests? What made them get into this business, is it family run? At the moment, it's just a faceless brand trying to break the U.K, it needs humanising more! 1. Mmm these look bloody delicious! I'm especially loving the unusual flavour combinations, 'flaxseed and carrot' or 'white chocolate & strawberry' sure beats the bog standard apple & cinnamon you normally get (although I appreciate the classics are still there in the product range, because apple and cinnamon is still great, let's be honest). I feel like these are really modern and uplifting flavours.
2. I don't think there's much else that would convince me to buy these, they are right up my street. I guess as long as the price for 6 isn't wildly more expensive than your usual brands in the UK, then I would be keen to try them out. I would like to see some of the unusual flavour combinations on offer, as it would allow me to test the range without too much commitment. It would be good to know if there's no added sugar, and a focus on natural flavourings, maybe with a call-out sticker on the pack.
3. Definitely Quaker Oats spring to mind as I buy them already. I'd say supermarket own brand might actually be in competition as people buy instant oats a lot, and because the price of oats is cheap anyway, I'm assuming a lot of people wouldn't want to spend a lot of money on trialling a new brand. 1. Not the most groundbreaking addition to the product offering, but definitely a good one. I am really impressed with the fresh but homely packaging design, it's got real shelf appeal. Would instantly make me think, 'ohhh that looks fancy!'
2. The first thing that made me think these are a great product, is that they don't contain palm oil. Yes! Finally more brands are taking notice. I have also head a lot about the benefits of rapeseed oil, so this seems like a good addition. The flavour combinations are again unusual and appealing, I like that there's a decent savoury option too as I really like eating porridge with salt and milk (like the Scots) and enjoy eating savoury crackers, so it's good that all of the options aren't sickly sweet.
3. I don't need to go wheat-free so this doesn't bother or effect me at all. I'm indifferent to this statement!
4. I'd like to think that the individual size of the biscuits isn't too stingy, as I often think snack biscuits are way too small in each serving and so you end up eating more than one pack sometimes! 
5. Belvita bars - they're the most famous UK brand I feel at the moment that springs to mind if you think of cereal bars for breakfast. They're like faux healthy, the packaging and marketing makes you think that they're a healthy snack on the go but they're actually just like normal biscuits with all the sugar. Go Ahead bars - not as close in terms of actual product as they're different cereals and yoghurt covered, but I'd say they're another well-known brand that covers that snacking occasion. Nutri-Grain potentially? I'm not sure how popular these are now as again, they're pretty sickly sweet. They conjure up memories of only eating them on the way to school because they were 'trendy' as a snack when I was a teenager (peer pressure is weird sometimes), I didn't even really like them but they're quite filling and satisfying I guess. 1. Wow! Yes, totally totally into this idea. Can't say I've ever really heard of oat pasta. You're on to a winner here guys! If it can increase your daily fibre intake too then I'm all for it. 
2. I'd want to try it firstly, purely for it's novelty value. Also because the flavouring from the vegetables and colour effect is really something different, you can imagine it would impress guests with a simple sauce if you wanted. Does it come in a paper bag packaging? That would definitely win the purchase over plastic for me. It would need to be a reasonable price point despite the novelty value, I don't want it to be seen as a 'special' purchase because pasta is a staple in my eyes.
3. Hmmm this is a really tough one, as I genuinely can't think of much that is widely available that would compete with this. Especially with it being in paper packaging, that's unfortunately just not the norm when it comes to buying pasta. I'd say the first brand that springs to mind when I'm buying pasta is Napolina, they do good quality but easy to get hold of pasta. The stylish nature of Elovena did make me think of Crosta & Mollica as a similarly modern and fresh looking brand but when I searched they don't do pasta yet. De Cecco is the only other pasta brand I can think of that you can find quite easily that has bright, fresh packaging and is probably on the same price point. Nothing other than Italian brands spring to mind though! 1. Woohoo, this announcement feels like my flexitarian prayers have been answered! It's really great to see so many brands offering plant-based alternatives to meals and food I would traditionally have gone for e.g burgers, when I'm trying to think of an easy dinner solution and don't want to have to think too creatively about something that's vegetarian. I really like the sound of the flavours, my only concern is imagining what the texture of minced oat and sweet potato would be. First impressions makes me worry it could be a bit gloopy and not hold together very well.
2. Oat patties is fine, but feels very American which doesn't suit the brand. Oat Burgers is obviously the UK equivalent but very matter of fact. Really don't like oat balls! Sounds like those horrid protein balls people feel they need to eat after hitting the gym! You're going to need to include oat in the title so this is hard to name anything other than quite matter-of-fact language. Oat Steaks is the only other version I can think of, but think it's too much for the shape and feel of the product.
3. I'd be pretty happy to try these, I think some focus on the herbs or spices included on the pack could make the flavours jump out more, I'd worry that the overall effect would be quite bland as it's clear it's low fat, low salt etc. 1. Really lovely, has great shelf appeal! I love the idea of mixing the more traditional feel illustration with the modern product photography, and especially with the block colour background. My only criticisms would be; the woman has too much of the oat in her hands, it's distracting to the rest of the image, it has more depth when she is half and half on the image as the porridge packaging doesn't have enough depth, I'm also not keen on the sea salt and seeds depicted on the second pack, the first product shot is the best out of them all as it feels a lot more 3D.
2. Definitely! Again, this is largely down to the colour palettes chosen and the mix between traditional and none traditional designs. It's very clear and easy to understand copy and image so I'd instantly know what I was picking up.
3. Fresh, exciting, flavoursome. 1. It's a great modern way to introduce more oats into your diet. They offer a range of flavoursome vegetarian and vegan friendly products, including some surprising savoury options. It's not just all porridge you know! It's not like most other healthy brands you see in the supermarket. 2. I think I'd probably go for the oat snack biscuits first, as I really liked the idea of the savoury options. I'd then probably move on to the oat pasta as this concept really intrigued me and I'd like to try the unusual flavour combinations. 3. I think that above all, the marketing around the product needs to feel authentic and not too try hard. Almost as if 'hey guys, we're kind of a big deal elsewhere in Europe, have you discovered us yet?' The last thing I'd want to see is a big social media push that focused on the wrong type of influencers trying your product, you'd need to work with recipe makers or genuine foodie bloggers that could talk about your product story in an engaging and down-to-earth way. It would be good to see some more video content from the brand too, on how to work the product into your everyday life.",Goldilocks,
300181,Tom,Evans,tom@tomevans.consulting,"Yeah it sounds wholesome and positive.
I like the Finnish provenance - Scandinavian lifestyle/nature is easy and simple to picture - and is aspirational.
I also like the ""life"" ""oat"" thought but I feel its more like you are saying Elovena is bringing/giving ""life"" and health and joy to us/me (rather than Elovena is just ""living for oats"" - that feels a lot smaller/one dimensional than the bigger Life/health thought)
On the better food choices thing - yes it is a complicated topic. Interested to see how Elovena will do this. You've set yourself up quite a challenge here! My instant reaction is: isn't Oat Meal one word? (Sorry if this is pedantic but it leapt out at me)
If Oat Meal is deliberate and its a Meal of Oats then this is an interesting thought - but I'm not clear on whether this is a mistake or not - I whether I'm just over noticing it :)
Instant oats sounds cool if they are as low GI as normal oats made in the normal way. As I hear that instant oats tend to be higher GI or ""less good for you"" but is this just a myth?
""Enjoy this instant oat meal for breakfast, lunch or have it as a snack."" might be a hard sell to get brits to eat porridge at any other time than breakfast but I guess people eat cereal at all times of the day but it that does feel a bit studenty/childish.
Gluten free doesn't resonate with me - but I guess it would with others. It's just not on my radar as an important feature of food.
I would be interested in the calories and sugar content of these. And also, rather tragically for me at the moment, how many Weight Watchers points they are!
Competitors would be Quaker and Supermarket own brands I guess (without looking) I really like the sound of these particularly the savoury ones as I not a huge sweet/sugar fan and also trying to keep calories to a minimum.
Like the no palm oil messaging - important.
Again I would need to know calories, fat, sugar content of these (and also Weight Watchers points - sorry!) I like this - as it feels like an easy way to get an extra veg into your day.
I'm watching the refined carbs so I would need to see how this stacked up calorie-wise and carb count wise.
Could be good for kids/parents this - as a way to get stealth veg into a meal.
Also I'm keen to see how it could be used in a foodie way. What are the recipes that work? ie what pasta dish is enhanced by a beetroot or broccoli pasta? That could be an interesting way in focusing on taste rather than (or as well as) health.
if its just Oat pasta (without the veg) I'm not quite sure how it stacks up to normal pasta. More fibre? If so how much? What are the health/calories benefits of that? And also how does it stack up taste-wise - is it any different/better/oatier taste-wise or is it imperceptible? I really like these! Particularly the burger. I've been looking for meat replacements for eco and health reasons. I've tried the Impossible burger in NYC but can't seem to find an alternative in the UK.
Naming. Yeah Oat Patties doesn't really say Burger to me. Could they be Oat Burgers? That would feel like the same family as Oat Balls. However, Oat Balls does sound a bit funny. I guess because Meatballs is one word. So the best expression could be OatBalls and OatBurgers?
An alternative is to invent a new MEAT alternative called ""MOAT"" geddit? A combination of MEAT and OAT. And then you could have Moat Burgers and Moatballs.
Then you could do a load of PR and a campaign around Moat as an innovative meat-alternative and own the category :) happy to help btw.
re competitors, I haven't looked that hard in the supermarkets (other than wanting to try the Impossible Burger in NYC burger joints) so couldn't name other brands beyond the obvious like Linda McCartney, Cauldron and supermarket own brands. Perhaps a way in would be to do what Impossible Burgers do and go in through restaurants/foodies/influencers first to establish its taste credentials.
btw can I try some of these?! In general I like it. Feels scando, premium.
The girl looks good at a glance but the longer you look at her she feels a bit distant. Like kind of Russian propaganda. Maybe its her eyes are looking lightly above you/kind of through you - she feels a bit detached. Also her hand is a bit dodgy :)
Product looks good.
Prefer the 2 layouts on the left with girl breaking into the blue above. (Raspberries above her head on the right hand one look weird)
Not sure whether I would pick it up or not - that is a difficult question to answer as the supermarket is a complex user journey and is dependent on other marketing/demand creation/awareness etc.
Three words: premium, healthy, retro/vintage 1. It's a cool new Scando brand that's launched in the UK with loads of healthy clever oat based snacks and foods 2. Oat Burgers and seed or cheese bars 3. I would maybe look at taste/foodies as a way in rather than ""health""",Goldilocks,
300182,Lousia,Woolley,Louisa_woolley@hotmail.com,"Yes it does resonate. It seems very familiar with the Scottish heritage oats we already have. The imagery isn't really that far away from nairns or quaker - its traditional and making the most of.its heritage.

I'd underline that they've been doing this for 100 years - I sort of already trust them as experts. The cleanest air in the world.is also very appealing (especially as a londoner). The pure water, clean air all sounds very alluring. I'm thinking on.this so have just noticed it doesn't mention of they're organic so they could be sprayed with God.know.what, but I was initially very taken in by that claim. 

I find it hard to know what I'd want to hear. Award winning is always a clincher - who else regards them as good? Some sort of outside verification. Why on earth is the porridge that colour? That is horrible food photography. It just doesn't look natural. Even the placement of the blueberries- who does that? The photography is really off putting. Then whenninread the text, I think they have a really interesting range of flavours. 

I feel like the flavours are really different to anything out there in the UK right now. Carrot and flaxseed, recurrent. I'd be interested to try. They'd also need to be at a keen price point. Single use sachets have been around for a while so we all have our favourites - price would definitely make me think twice about buying them. If they were making nutritional claims that would also.be very appealing for me. The gluten free thing I find confusing because aren't all oats? Is there anything on any other vitamins or.calcium?

I think they'd be competing against own brand products and Quaker single use sachets. I think they look great. I love the wholegrain claims and no palm oil, I also like the low saturated fat content. This nutritional stuff has really sold out to me. Flavours again seem interetsingbalthough I'm a savoury gal, I'd have liked some more choice there. The savoury flavours are pretty standard.

Free from wheat is not at all.important to.me because I dont have any intolerances but it.does mean that their manufacturing process will be pretty spot on to make such a claim. 

All the reasons above about the nutritional claims make me want to try them. I'd like to.know how many calories per biscuit. I guess price again.is important too.

I imagine the main competition.is nairns. I buy their oatcakes. Also own brand products which I occasionally buy. Oooh, oat pasta! I didn't know such a thing existed. I wonder what it tastes of? Love the vegetable claims - surely this just the juice of each though? My husband just made a bleugh noise so I could be experimenting alone.

Price point would be key on me trying it. I'm already interested but some alternative pastas are awful.and claggy so I wouldn't want to make an expensive mistake. I'd also want really precise cooking instructions. To me the veg claims already set it apart from anthingbelse I've seen. I think I imagine it more in my local health food shop than supermarket though.

Regarding the brands it's against, I dont have any idea I'm afraid. It would be up against things like whole wheat and spelt pasta from ranges. And possibly things already in the gluten free aisle like lentil pasta, but I dont shop them because I dont have intolerances and they're expensive. Initially I think that's probably not for me. I dont really do meat alternatives like that, although I enjoy vegetarian food. 

Oat patties and balls aren't a great name to be honest. I think that the veg content might be better to go with. I actually think the oat is possibly off putting. Sweet potatoes might be a better bet. Or highlight the protein in the title. Is oat a selling point for an alternative meat burger or is the fact that it's free from meat the selling point? 

In all honesty I'd eat these if they were given to me but I'd not buy them. It's just not something I'd eat. 

Again I don't know about what this is up against because i dont shop in that space. I'm guessing quorn though? I just googled and a brand called beyond meat came up. I dont really think anything one way or the other. I dont like or dislike it. I get the Scandinavian thing and the nod to tradition. It's probably not a million miles away from.quaker. the bold colours are a bit different to the more muted colours we see on our packaging so it would stand out on the shelf as being different I think. The food photography of the sea salt and seeds is a bit odd, somehow it looks like its floating rather than on a table.

Would I pick it off the shelf? I'm not sure. It would depend on.the price point definitely and how much of the range was there. It would definitely catch my eye. I think some of the more obscure flavours would intrigue me to pick it up.

Bright, traditional, blonde lady. The blonde lady is very prominent. ooh, you like your porridge in.the morning too don't you. Yeah there's this new brand I've found and they do really exciting and interesting flavours. They've got nice oatcakes too and dont use palm oil. (It really would.depend on which friend I was talking to but they're the things most important to me) The snack biscuits I would definitely try. Perhaps the porridge sachets - I dont often eat them but I could be persuaded by the interesting flavours. I wouldn't buy the meat replacement burgers because I just dont.eat those things. Maybe the pasta, that's one I'm likely to take on recommendation. Thinking more about what I said on the pasta, I could definitely see it in health food shops. In the supermarket I wonder if it's too niche?",Goldilocks,
300183,Naomi,Filio,naomiwynnemorgan@gmail.com,"1. Interesting. I hadn't actually considered the conditions that oats are grown in. Having grown up in the countryside I was used to seeing oat, wheat and barley grown on UK soil. 
Does it resonate with me? Yes, I like the visualisation of healthy, fresh growing conditions and the romantic image it creates!
2. I liked the reference to the name. I enjoy the nuances of language so it was interesting to me. By contrast I didn't like the statement that food is complicated. It finishes in my mind as negative and a bit patronising. I was to be encouraged to find food inspiring not be reminded about the tedious aspects of cooking.
3. I'd like to have a rough idea of the range of products. 1. I hadn't thought oats had gluten anyway. The gluten reference actually puts me off as I can eat gluten and I often find gluten free food has a different texture and consistency than I like. 
I'd love to try the Flaxseed and Carrot. That sounds amazing. Chocolate in cereal always puts me off. It should be a healthy, nutritious meal -chocolate is so unnecessary. The fact this advertises chocolate varieties does make me question the sugar content of their products. 
The image looks really appetising. The packaging...I'm in two minds about. It has that retro vibe with this ad but if not quite spot on it could just look really dated. 
2. Ah sorry, I have partially answered this above. I am intrigued by some of the flavours. I love the handy packet size so really portable. I question adding water rather than milk. Does it contain milk powder? Can you cook them with milk? If you buy larger packs can you make these with milk?  The other thing as I said earlier is wanting to check how healthy they are. 
3. They would be competing against the Quaker Oats sachets I buy currently (for work breakfasts) Or against the supermarket branded own bag of oats we have for eating at home. I have also seen the plastic pot single oat servings I think by Quaker and supermarkets own versions. 1. Yum! I love the sound of the cheese and seeds and sea salt. The image is enticing. Looks rustic and simple. The text covers info I'd want to know. The word biscuit is slightly confusing to me. Is it a sweet treat type snack or is it supposed to be more of a filling food item. Biscuit conjures up a sense of treat, not particularly filling or nutritional...
2. I like the nutritional detail it actually makes me want to check these out and they wouldn't be something I'd usually buy. I have Nairn's Cheese oatcakes which I love for snacks. 
3. Not important at all. I want fibre rich filling foods.
4. Why would I choose these..if for a snack they'd need to be have some decent calories and not too much sugar etc. If a biscuit...umm, I don't actually eat a lot of biscuits so I guess tasty, feel like a nice treat, a pick me up. 
5. Nairn's Oatcakes if these are more snack based. Or Belvita if a breakfast based 'biscuit'. 1. Oat pasta?! Mind blown. My daughter is a carb girl (pasta, spaghetti, rice, bread). She will love this! I love the fact that it packs healthy veg in there too! Plus the pasta colours are beautiful. 
2. I would definitely try these based on the veg content and I'm curious about the oat addition. 
I would want to know about the price point. Also I would like to be able to buy different types of pasta (fusilli etc)
3. Eep, I either buy Aldi basic or I buy fun colourful pasta from TKMaxx :speak_no_evil: so I'm not sure what it may compete with. I guess the classic pasta brands- Napolina. 1. Umm the title is not enticing. I wouldn't necessarily buy these as they don't sound too appetising but I may try them when I have vegetarian friends over. 
2. Oat Bakes? Oat Afles? A take on falafels?!
3. I'm not sure that the 'minced oats' phrase works for me as I am expecting beef to follow and have to re-adjust. They should be proudly vegan and not try to mimic meat (but I'm not a vegetarian shopper so this may be not what others are looking for). Equally, the ready to use phrase makes me think of microwave quality and taste. I wonder if the selling point should be that these are a food that can hold their own and are an enjoyment to cook with. I guess, you can't really do much with them as is (I was thinking of halloumi which is probably the closest substitute I can reference - and I mix up how I cook this i.e. with garlic/butter etc etc). But maybe the point with these is that they can be eaten in different ways (BBQ, in salad cold for lunch, warmed with veg and potato etc). 
4. I guess for me it would be halloumi or vegetarian sausages. 1. Too narrow, too obvious (blond, white, young). I know it is trying to represent Finland (and I haven't been so can't comment on the demographics) but it just feels slightly old fashioned and not diverse at all. That puts me off. 
I'm not especially keen on the purple colour as it seems a bit insipid. 
In terms of the proportions of the person/food - the first one works best for me. 
2. As above I don't love the woman/girl on the front. It definitely wouldn't encourage me to pick it up. I think the character gives it an old fashioned edge. I would rather the Finnish Flag or maybe even an outline of the country. That would certainly make me more curious.
3. Bold :) Simple :) Old Fashioned :( 1. Many flavours. High in fibre. Innovative. Interesting and inspiring flavours. Interesting alternatives. Finnish. Great with oats! 2. Ooh that is a hard one! I can't choose between the pasta and the biscuits. Probably the biscuits because I love a good savoury snack- they're versatile for many hunger needs! And those flavours sounded really tasty. But the pasta! I live beetroot and usually you only get beetroot or spinach and these had carrot! I'd buy the biscuits and then sneak the pasta into my basket! ;) 3. Maybe make the packaging less old fashioned and dare I say 'trendy' (urgh, sorry!) Keep it bold, simple and appeal to a wider audience without more white people on packaging.",Goldilocks,
300179,Sara,Björkegren,S.c.bjorkegren@gmail.com,"1. I would like to try their products! I like the fact that their products are produced in Finland. This is sustainable for the climate. 
2. "" oats grown in Finnish fields for nearly 100 years"" - this speaks to me. It is compelling to refer 100 years back in time. This gives me confidence to belive in their products. The grown oats history in finland is long and this means no ""quick fix"" like GMO. 
3. What are their products? That would be nice to know. And when can I eat these products, are they ment to eat for breakfast/lunch/dinner? 1. I wouldnt say this is someting unique for elovena. I remeber eating the same kind of qich oat meal in San Fransisco ten years ago. But that one contain a lot of sugar. Maybe this one doesnt (besides from natural sugars in the fruits). But I like the fact that it contains wholegrain oats, I dont think the oat meal I ate in San Fransisco did that.
2. I want the read the backside of the package to read the ingredients, to see what the product really contains.  I want to make sure that is doesnt added sugar.  I believe dried fruit contains lots of sugar, I guess thats what the use. 
3. This is a difficult question! I never consume these kind and products so I really dont know what Elovena competes with. But I know that AXA has a lot of oat products. I found the image below, wich means they also sell instant oat meals. 1. I would never buy this product. These kind of biscuits were popular 15 years ago in Sweden. Then people realized they contained a lot a sugar. Sometimes even more sugar then their favourite cookies. Fibres are good to keep hunger away, but sugar makes you hungry were quick, so I dont see the point. I think people are skeptical to ""healty bisquits"" now adays. 
2. Nothing is appealing to me, more than the fact that they probably taste very good (and sweet)
3. Not very important? Since I would not buy them anyway.
4. The ingredients! I dont believe in any product before I see the ingredients.
5. 1. I first believed that the pasta was gluten free and thought, nice! But then I saw that it wasnt and though, okey. Oat pasta is new for me, I wonder if is tastes oat? The line "" from all natural ingredients; durum wheat flour and oats"" does not hit me. Of course seeds are natural ingredients? They try to make is sound healty, which Im not sure, speaks to swedish consumers. 
2. Once again, I want to see the ingredients. How much oat is there compared to wheat flour? 
3. 1. I would like to try them! Since I am vegetarian I always look for new plant based products. 
2. Yes, maybe the names are not the best they can be right now. The word ""patties"" means nothing to me. Balls is maybe not that mind blowing either. Maybe something new and cretive? Something that feel more new and trendy.
3. Ingredients...and of course price! Oat is cheap, so the price can not be that high?
4. 1. The packaging flirt with packaging from th 60´s and 70´s, which sould be kind of trendy right now. But I dont feel the trendy-feeling. Which maybe is good.  I think the packaging tells a history of experience - I feel that this is not a new brand. It has been going on for some time. 
2. I am not sure. I guess (and hope) I buy products after what they contain and not because of the packaging. But maybe I would buy it if I were interested in the product.
3. confident, simple and warm 1. Not before I have tried their products!  2. The pasta and the patties/balls 3. Maybe work some on the packaging to make it feel more retro-new. It is retro the way it is right now, which is good, but the packaging needs something new to make it feel not old fashion. Maybe working on the fonts? Try to fins something that looks more modern. Skip the biscuits! Unless they dont contain any sugar/apple juice, they will only make look like fools. People are not fooled by these healty biscuits any more, people actually want to buy real healty food nowadays. Unless you can not offer that - skip the product.",Goldilocks,
308924,Aleksandra,Baszuro,Ola.baszuro@gmail.com,"In general, the text does resonate with me. I believe that eating is one of the biggest pleasures people can have in life. Unfortunately, this may be a tricky pleasure and may cause lots of diseases. The only way to combine remaining in good health and pleasure of eating is by choosing the quality food products and keeping a balanced diet. Oats are part of it.
When it comes to the most compelling parts, it's definitely the one about ""pure water, fertile soil and the freshest air in the world"". These are the keywords to me as I strongly believe that there is a direct connection between my health and the quality of water, soil, and air. Additionally, I'm living in the country, where air pollution is the burning issue so I obviously worry about growing food in these conditions. However, I'm a bit torn here. The vision of eating grains grown in healthy conditions is very tempting but on the other hand, there are concerns about transportation and the carbon footprint. This is my main concern. 
To make this text more compelling I would need more reference to hard data. To me, Finnland, as a part of Scandinavia, is a synonym of undisturbed nature. But this may be just my imagination and, along with developing eco-awareness, I've learned not to trust unproven beliefs and buy words, which may be actually empty. This text mentions ""unique conditions"" but does not refer to any paper that confirms that these conditions are indeed unique. Initial reactions are positive: I often use instant oat meals at the office if I don't have time for breakfast at home. However, I don't like sachets - in the office, where teacups are always missing and bowls are not provided it's too much trouble. These mugs made from recycled paper and plastic are way more convenient. 
To try these oat meals I would need to have a selection of flavors. Except for the flaxseed and carrot, the listed flavors are pretty usual. I miss nuts. 
At the moment my favorite oat meals are coming from a local manufacturer called ""Inna Bajka"" (https://inna-bajka.pl/) - they offer great flavors, ie. espresso and white mulberry or matcha and chia. These are getting more and more popular, but the price is also quite high. The direct competitors for Elovena would be ""Sonko"" (http://sonko.pl/en) and ""Kupiec"" (https://www.kupiec.pl/en/), who sell instant oat meals in sachets and are available in almost all stores. The initial reaction for this product is not positive, though the flavors are really appealing. My experience shows that these ""healthy biscuits"" are only called so. All fiber biscuits I've tried were full of sugar, usually the white one. If the composition of these biscuits would be different, then I would choose them over other biscuits. This is not very appealing product for me as I almost cut biscuits from my diet.
I would probably try these biscuits because of the flavors (especially orange & chocolate, and strawberry & rhubarb), but I would definitely like to know more about sugars in this product. 
Being free from wheat is not really important for me. Personally, I do not demonize wheat if it's used on a reasonable scale. The more important for me not including the palm oil. 
I believe that the direct competitors for Elovena would be ""Oshee"" (https://osheeshop.eu/oshee-natural-musli-bar-migdaly-kakao-platki-40g,82,934.html), ""Bakalland"" (https://bakalland.pl/produkt/ba/baton-protein-ba-before-training/) and ""Sante"" (https://sante.pl/). Initial reactions are very positive. I love really pasta and I'm always eager to try new ones. These flavors are unique, I've never tried carrot or beetroot pasta so I would definitely put them into my shopping basket! 
I'm not able to share any competitors as I don't know any oat pasta manufacturer. The most popular pasta manufacturer in my country, ""Lubella"", which is present in all stores, does not have such a product in their offer. The reaction to this product is rather neutral as I usually don't include such balls in my diet. The non-meat balls I know are only available in Ikea or restaurants. 
Regarding the name, I'm not sure if these are the best names. Depending on the translation, in my language, it would not make any special connotations or make meaty connections. Personally, I would go for ""oat falafel"" as falafels are very trendy and do not have the bad meaty connotations among vegans and vegetarians. 
I would like to try this product because usually vege burgers, patties or balls include chickpeas and I don't like this ingredient. To choose Elovena over other products, I would need good taste, availability and good package size. I cook for me and my partner and 210g seems a bit small for hungry two.
I cannot share competitors. At the moment the only non-meat balls I know are sold in Ikea. I don't know companies that sell non-meat patties - I've seen some soy patties in the stores but these simply look gross and after seeing them I feel rather sick than tempted. Initial reactions are rather negative. This packaging is not compelling to me. The company name font reminds me of Wedel logo and Wedel has nothing to do with health. And the lady with the sheaf... I cannot decide does she looks like pasted from the vintage cookie box or the propaganda poster from communism times. For the natural product, I would also prefer more natural colors. The color at the bottom part of the picture in the middle is too bold.
The three words would be: folksy, gaudy and messy. I would tell my friend that some interesting Finnish products will be launched in our country. Finnish products are not popular in my country, however most of my female friends heard from me about Finnish cosmetic manufacturer and they enjoyed the recommendation so probably mentioning the country of origin would be enough to get my friends curious. My first choice would be the pasta, certainly a unique product! I've seen anything like that so far and I cook a lot. Next product would be oat balls or instant oat meal. The less interest I have in biscuits. I believe that several things may be important: first would be availability, the second - good package that does not reminds other brands or old posters. Knowing the competition, re-consideration of the tastes of the instant meals may be a good idea.",Goldilocks,
252377,Chloe,Kembery,chloekembery@gmail.com,"You can cut the origin story of doing it for 100 years... Or at least add that later. The naming thing is cool to understand. The thing that really appeals is the description of the conditions the oats grow in, the clean air, and long summer sunlight.... It makes me wonder how 24 hour sunlight might make the oars more intense? As someone conscious about health and my macros i would be swayed by a protein oats offer. Quick oats are simple to make anyway, in a sachet or just out of the box. In general I don't buy flavoured oat options but the dark chic and raspberry is unusual and quite luxe sounding, so that appeals. The things this would compete with are just that I buy regular oats, jumbo from Sainsbury's taste the difference range as they seem to be the best, and then I add whatever I like to them To be honest I wouldn't buy these, biscuits are not something I eat. But what I do find appealing is that these seem considered in their ingredients. It is not important to me that they are wheat free, but I aim to eat a range of grains not just wheat, so it is good to know what they contain. Bizarrely what I am excited about most is that the salt and seeds flavour and the cheese flavour offer savoury pocket size snack options, which are quite hard to find if you want something low fat. I would appreciate knowing their protein and fat content clearly on the pack Wow this is quite a new idea. I moved to eating pea pasta a year ago, and would be interested to try these. I am particularly interested in the colour options these would create on the plate - I am imagining a strong red for beetroot, orange for a carrot, green for broccoli. They also seem like a great way to sneak veggies into kids meals if you have small people who don't eat veg. The brands they would be competing with, for me, are napolina green pea pasta, Sainsbury's own brand pea/lentil pasta and rummo traditional durum wheat pasta when I want something standard. On balance, the pea/lentil pastas are the main competitors on the shelf for me. My first reaction is that they sound... Odd. And I'm not convinced they would have much protein. This isn't the sort of food I eat so it is unlikely I would buy them unless they were reduced or on special offer. But they are high fibre, low in fat and salt and that is all good stuff that would make me consider them. How much protein will I really get from them, that's the question.... 1. Attractive, colourful, retro... A bit aryan though
2. Maybe. Yes if it were on special offer. I currently buy Sainsbury's taste the difference jumbo oats, so I'd be curious to know how big the flakes are for the oats on their own pack. For the snack biscuits, I am not buying this kind of product currently so it is hard to compare. I guess Belvita is the closest comparative product and these seem a bit more scandi-cool 1. I'd recommend the oat pasta, if it was good, as she can't eat wheat. And probably the quick oats for smoothie making too. I'd explain that I like the regular oats (assuming the flakes are a decent rolled oat size) and highlight that they are a long standing, reliable and traditional Finnish brand, and their oats grow in clean Finnish nature, a little delivery from a land known for calm, happy wellbeing 
 2. I'd buy the oats, definitely. I'd also like to try the oat pasta, and the oat patties/balls...maybe? I'd actually be more likely to try an Elovena product having taken part in this exercise, as I'm curious. I might buy the savoury biscuits for long bike rides and trips. 3. Finns are renowned for good design, so prioritising a distinctive packaging that is also easy to use and recycle is important. The silence and beauty of Finnish nature is a real selling point too, as these oats are like a little package of that goodness. The products also work well for the whole plant-based living thing. I'd welcome sampling opportunities at health-related places e.g. leisure centres, fitness studios. I'd like to know more about what it means to be an Elovena girl/woman, and how oats contribute to a healthy, outdoorsy lifestyle and optimism for the future.",Goldilocks,
300185,Rob,Andrews,robbieandrews@me.com,"Don't over-claim. To ""bring back the joy of eating"" is to imply that it went away in the first place. I would be amazed if many people felt that eating was completely joyless experience. I would be even more surprised if those people felt that porridge oats was the natural remedy for that joylessness.

Finnish conditions sound glorious. The result sounds a little worthy and uninspiring by comparison. I know it's a little trite to suggest that you wrap up all these wonderful things – the air, the water, the soil, the sun – into every grain or every mouthful, but you have licence to say it. And at the moment your end product seems so ""grounded"" that impression you come away with is that ""thanks to our long days, we can get the tractor out of the shed really early"". I'm buying the emotional hook (purity, freshness) much more than the practical hook (nutricious), and that's what makes me want to find out more. But an oat is an oat, and at the moment I put my oat-trust in a tough-nut boulder-throwing Scotsman in a kilt to deliver them for me (and certainly not some beaming puritan ponce in a big hat) – who am I aligning myself with if I go Elovenian; what makes them more compelling than your man Rob Roy over there?

Also, ""nutritious"" is a replacement word for ""worthy"", ""practical"", and, worst of all ""sensible"", and part of value of this statement needs to be to make ""sensible"" sexy. I'm hoping that there is a Finnish, oats-and-bowel-movement-based version of Hygge that people will be able to fall over themselves to access – if there isn't, I hope that you invent one!

""We live for oats"" is lovely. It spotlights the name, makes the company immediately credible (with a very modern level of personal investment in their business – the kind that you would expect from an artisan selvage jeans manufacturer in east London), gives it resonance and helps make it memorable. It's not a meal, is it. I mean, it's a bit of a meal. But it's not a meal.

I'd call it a breakfast, and I can see myself having it for breakfast, especially a ""cycled into work early, bite at my desk before the slog"" type of breakfast, and feeling very virtuous about myself for having had it.
And I'd certainly call it a supper. I used to have Cornflakes or Weetabix at nine o'clock every night, with a cup of coffee. Last meal of the day – bingo, job done! Now, I pick at random things in the cupboard and don't have that routine – feeling peckish, can lay my hands on two Babybel and a Banana, yep, fair enough, I  can make that work. Elovena sounds like a great proper supper.

And choose it over other ""oat meals""? I never have an ""oat meal"". It sound like the precursor to an enema. ""The night before you are admitted, please eat the oat meal enclosed, and refrain from eating thereafter, until after the procedure is complete."" I might have a snack, which in these heady weeks pre-Easter, will be a Creme Egg. Or it might be an Eat Natural bar, or a Layers of Joy from the fridge, or I might make myself some toast. I can see Elovena being a satisfactory replacement for every one of those things.

What they'd need to have to win over one of those things is depth of flavour. Think about toast. The lovely malty taste of the bread, the saltiness and creaminess of the butter, the sweetness and tang of the jam – pack those things into a porridge all in one go, and we'd be off to the races. It's why I love Eat Natural – every now and then, you get a little kick of coconut, and just for a second you think ""Wow! Was that coconut? I love coconut"". 

Have a look at the serving suggestion in the photo above, porridge with blueberries, pecans, some kind of seed – that's starting to feel rich; perhaps it needs a little golden syrupy sugar kick, or some fragrant honey; rich rich rich. Now look at the actual flavours – one or two things; no unexpected combinations; nothing Finnish. (Weirdly, I'd give Flaxseed and Carrot a go first - it sounds traditional and local) I've just done a quick bit of research – Finns put cardamom on French toast, and cloudberries on cheesecake. Cloudberry? What the hell is that? I want to find out now (and I want to know if it goes with cardamom).

As for the competition - I pretty much ran out ideas after Oat So Simple (the only brand I could recollect without prompting). So time for the research to kick in – I'm quite lucky, as two of my two local supermarkets are Waitrose in South Woodford and the Eat 17 Spar in Walthamstow Village. They are both temples to food that looks like the bottom of a hamsters' cage – the Eat 17 Spar even has those serve-yourself dispensers with their own house blend of granola. 

Looking at their stuff, there seems to be a ton of little niche producers, all beautifully packaged – Posh, Moma, Dorset Cereals – many of them in little ready-to-eat pots (for people who can't heat milk without instructions). The ones that look like the biggest challengers to Elovena I would have thought would be the vulgar-ish Rude Health range, the posh version of Oat So Simple, and an interesting little artsy brand from the Tirol called Verival – Austrians, eh, I bet they know a thing or two about porridge. 

I am tempted by absolutely none of them. I did buy a vanilla custard doughnut handmade by a genuine Portuguese man in the Eat 17 Spar whilst I was researching. It was delicious. If Elovena gave you some of these as samples, I'll happily take them off your hands.
I would have these as my go-to biscuit in a shot.

Oat biscuits are awesome to start off with. But then the flavours! 
I would happily play Oat Snack Roulette and take my chances with any of these. 
The combinations sound thoughtful, I love the fact that there are savoury ones in the mix, and that there's rhubarb in there (I grew up in the rhubarb triangle - love the stuff). I'd love some über-Finnish one in the mix too (chuck in a cardamom pod, someone).

The wheat-free bit, I care not a jot. However, my mum has colitis and I know that not having to go down the beige leper's aisle at Sainsbury's for biccies would mean a lot to her. From my perspective, it's nice to be able to go ""Here you go Mum, you can have these too!"" with something that I'm already eating.

As for competitors…
They wouldn't be up against the other niche oat biscuits (Nairn being the big name that I always see), but weighing in against the biscuit heavyweights. They are clearly a class above your Hob-nob (and I love Hob-nobs) which takes you into Doves Organic territory perhaps, but more likely into Sainsbury's Taste the Difference, M&S, or the top end of Fox's. Mixing in this heady company would depend a lot on taste, but if the taste was right, the mix of oats and interesting toppings makes Elovena sound more appealing (and a little bit different). 
In other words, Elovena fits in with the cookies we buy for the family when we're spoiling ourselves a little bit. This one, I don't get.
Flour + Egg (or water) = Pasta. Add anything else and it stops being pasta. 
If I wanted more fibre with my pasta, I'd throw some veggies into the sauce, not change the pasta.
The neutrality of the pasta taste  is deliberate, there as a base for the sauce. Does this pasta taste of porridge and carrots? Or does it taste of pasta?
And veggie juice in pasta is there to make it look a pretty colour, that's it.
It's not like the pasta is gluten free – there's durum wheat flour in there too, so there's no dietary gain or people with colitis &c.
And it's just called pasta. Pasta is more specific than that. Different shapes are designed for different types of sauce – is it gloopy, is it runny, does it have bits in it. It's a but like buying soup out of a tin marked ""soup"" – might work, might not.
So the whole concept ends up sounding like the way that we hide vegetables to get the kids to eat them, but again, we hide them in the sauce, not in the pasta. 

If I sound confused, well, frankly I think that I am. I'm really struggling to see the benefit.

So what would make me try it? A lot of sauce for starters. But in truth, nothing. I like my pasta pasta-y and see not reason to experiment with something that really doesn't feel broken.

And who would you be competing with? Again, I'm struggling. If there is an aisle for unusual composition pasta, I've no recollection of it, and I certainly have never sought it out. And this doesn't sit with the gluten-free pastas, so it's just up with the general pasta brands, I guess. Rummo and De Cecco are my go-to in terms of how they cook. I eat meat. About 50% of my evening meals have a meat component. But we had veggie tonight, and I love it. So I never have cause to substitute meat with anything. I'd rather have an echt chick pea stew than a faux beefburger, even if they are made out of exactly the same ingredients.
As you might be able to tell, there is not one single factor that would make me try one of these.

Naming-wise – I think that ""Plant based meant alternative"" has got a ring to it. Okay, maybe not. 
You can't call them balls, even if they're fundamentally ball-shaped. ""Oat balls? I didn't know oats had…"". And patty is an Americanism. McDonalds can call it a patty until they're blue in the face, but it will still sound faintly alien to English ears.
So I think that a new name would help. But not of from the category of ""Mylk-with-a-Y"" – a word redolent of replacement. Something new, that makes the product valuable in its own right, not as a next-best-thing to something good. It kind of reminds me of Upma – well it's not far off – which is another one of those things that if you listed out the ingredients you'd probably go ""meh"", but when you eat is delicious.

And again, competitor-wise, this is uncharted territory for me in supermarkets. I know that Linda McCartney do this kind of thing, and I recently came across Strong Roots, who look tolerable in a hipster hairdresser meets artisan dog food kind of way – but I really am guessing! I said in the earlier questions that I tend to be a little dismayed by the practicalities of packaging. Product plus serving suggestion plus mnemonic plus logo plus name plus brand colour equals design. 

This packaging is so close to the perfect simplicity of the Kellogg's Corn Flakes pack, but just a little under-refined.
That said, I love it. Partly because it breaks visual norms – blue food packaging? How peculiar. Partly because the logo is a timeless thing of beauty, but it's way way too big, and the product is tiny, and slightly unloved. And the mnemonic girl is bizarre – an illustration from a 1950s Mittel-european children's book, and sort of delightfully naive (against the slickness of Dorset Cereals, say).
I used to tell my junior designers that no-one buys background, and this pack design suffers a but from that. It's just slightly unbalanced. Is the name of the company really 50% of the story? Because it has 50% of the real estate. 

Yes, it is compelling enough to get me to pick it up, but really for sheer curiosity value. I worry then that the messaging lacks the carry through to get me to put this in the trolley – ""Ooh, Snackbiscuit, my favourite.""

So, my three words are:

Blue
Unbalanced
Different I would certainly buy their biscuits.I would probably buy their porridge.I would never buy their pasta or their balls. I think that it boils down to an expectation of what oats are for. Perhaps that makes me oat-risk-averse, but I try and buy things that are going to delight me, and oat pasta and burgers felt like too much of a stretch, whilst not offering an tangible improvement on the original. So, dearest best friend – there's this brand called Elovena. They've been around forever in Finland, and they're bringing their brand over here. They seem a bit earnest, but very motivated, and a little bit kookie. They do some stuff that sounds really interestingly unpredictable, and I'd really like to try, they do some militant-über-veggie stuff that I'd never touch with a barge pole.

And my final note: perhaps as your Tirolean porridge competitor makes it clear a few questions ago, there is a movement amongst British shoppers toward provenance. You hide yours under a bushel. A little more Finland dotted here and there would help. It might be a flag mnemonic or a way of talking (think Ikea product naming) or an ingredient or a particular pattern (the reason I love seeing Volotea planes at the airport).",Goldilocks,
262618,Kate,Rushton,krushtie33@gmail.com,"1. What are your initial reactions? Does it resonate with you? Why / why not? 

My initial reaction is “meh” and it just does not resonate. 

This is all marketing fluff with nothing to back it up. How about we have been grown in Finnish fields for 100 years and we have provided jobs, protected the earth by planting xx trees etc. 

What did you give back in the 100 years?

I am also cynical about the words “natural” and “healthy”. What do they actually mean?

Also, where is the story behind this? I just think a brand is more compelling if there is a story. For example, the guy behind Starbucks was inspired by Italian coffee shops and the Italian coffee culture and wanted to bring it back to the US. 

2. Imagine you have a red marker. If you could underline the most compelling part of what you just read, what would it be? Why is it so compelling?

I think it would have to be the phrase “joy of eating”, mainly because we live in a world of misinformation, dieting and huel. It is almost as if the pleasure of eating has been forgotten by the need to eat quickly, “on-the-go” and care more about micronutrients etc than just delicious food. 

3. What would you like to know more about? What’s missing that would make this even more compelling for you?

I would like to know more about the environmental footprint of the company. What is the company doing to reduce climate change compared to other brands. How are they reducing their carbon footprint?

What does Elovena do for social impact? Do they provide fair wages? Do they support the local community?

I would also like to know how is Elovena healthier and better for me. What does it have that other oats products don’t have? 1. What are your initial reactions to Elovena Gluten Free Instant Oat Meals? 

Yes…

My brother is gluten free and loves camping and the great outdoors. This would be a great product for him and his family of young kids. They would be able to take it with them on trips. 

It would also be good for the wider family because we never know what to give my gluten-free brother. 

I also love oats but always run out of milk and sometimes I just don’t want to drink too much milk. These things are perfect. I have lots of Quaker Oats in my cupboard but they are untouched because I have no milk. 

2. What would actually make you want to try these oat meals? Is there anything else that these oat meals would need to have for you to choose them over other oat meals? 

It depends on the price of the oat meals. If they are the same price or cheaper than alternatives then they are a winner for me. 

What size of bowl is needed for them? It would be great if there was a pack with reusable bowls or spoon that change colour when the porridge is ready. I am just thinking of my niece and nephew and what bowls they would like. 

It would be great if this porridge replaced my daily vitamins. :-) Then I would not have to always remember to take them. 

It would be great if a couple of the flavours were more nostalgic e.g. apple crumble, banana bread

http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipes/tag-5630/winter-desserts.aspx

It would also be interested in more savoury flavours too. Could ginger and chilli work - https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/quick-and-easy/savoury-porridge-with-ginger-and-chilli-oil/?

3. Show and tell us about 2-3 brands that you believe Elovena’s Gluten Free Instant Oat Meals would be competing against in your local supermarket. 

An obvious competitor is Quaker Oats - the porridge sachets and pots. This porridge is reminiscent of my childhood and I love the golden syrup ones. I automatically grab this porridge when I am in the supermarket. It is my “go-to” food. 

After Quaker Oats, it has to be the own brand, no label alternatives that are cheaper. This is my “go-to” when I am on a budget. For 50 pence a pot, these pots are super cheap and the right price to just “give it a try” and compare it to Quaker Oats. 

Another alternative brand is Scotts Oats. I tend not to buy them as I am used to Quaker Oats. 1. What are your initial reactions to Elovena Oat Snack Biscuits? 

Yes, to being palm oil free. I would try them for that reason only. 

The packaging is so old fashion - almost Soviet! In a marketplace with lots of old fashioned packaging, would it stand out? Plus, it is a white blonde female on the packaging. Yes, she looks stereotypically Finnish but I think the UK market is a bit more multicultural and the packaging needs to be reflective of that. For this reason alone, I think you need a packaging redesign.

However, I love the image on the left. It shows the biscuits and they have a homemade look. No unnecessary packaging. 

2. What about the biscuits is most appealing to you? Why is this so appealing?

The fact that the biscuits are palm oil free. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see footage of the destruction of the Orang-utan’s habitat for palm oil. Anything I can do to reduce my consumption of palm oil is a winner for me. 

3. One of the main benefits of these biscuits is that they are free from wheat. How important is this to you? 

I have absolutely no idea what free from wheat means. Is wheat actually bad for you? Does it mean that the biscuits are gluten free?

I mean I grew up eating wheat and it seems totally normal for me so why would I want to remove it from my diet. 

4. What would actually make you want to try these biscuits? Is there anything else that these biscuits would need to have for you to choose them over other biscuits? 

I think the words “GM free” need to be included, if that is the case. 

The packaging needs a redesign, as mentioned, to make it current and multicultural. 

I would like to see it in sustainable packaging. How is it currently packaged and how does it compare to other similar products?

I am price sensitive so it needs to be the same price or less of other similar products. 

I do love the idea of the seeds & sea salt flavour and also cranberry and caramel. I do think you need to be more adventurous on the other flavours. They do seem a bit standard and what already exists on the market. 

Also, cheese - what cheese? Red Leicester? Finnish Goats Cheese? Lake Land Strawberries and Lapland Rhubarb?

I understand the brand is Finnish but where do you source the ingredients? I would love more transparency on this one. Is it entirely Finnish?

5. Show and tell us about 2-3 brands that you believe Elovena’s Oat Snack Biscuit would be competing against in your local supermarket.  1. What are your initial reactions to Elovena Oat Pasta? 

I love the idea. It is a great way to get my fruit and veg and decent fibre intake. 

The colours of the pasta are so “instagrammable”. I can see it being a hit. 

2. What would actually make you want to try this pasta? Is there anything else that  this pasta would need to have for you to choose them over other pasta? 

Why is the packaging not partly clear? This pasta is so colourful. Can we have mixed rainbow pasta? I would love to make a bowl of mixed red, green and orange pasta. Kids would love it too. 

Is the packaging sustainable? Please do make it sustainable…

Can you update the design for the packaging? It is a bit old fashioned. 

What dishes can I make with the pasta? Can you link to recipes?

How much is it? If it is 20% more than other pastas, I would buy it for its nutritional value

Do you donate to charity projects e.g. city gardens with every purchase?

3. Show and tell us about 2-3 brands that you believe Elovena’s Oat Pasta would be competing against in your local supermarket.

I don't think there are that many competitors here. 1. What are your initial reactions to Elovena Oat Patties & Balls? 

Yes, I love the concept. I am not eating that much meat these days. So these sound ideal. It is a shame the flavours are a bit cliche and it is packaged in packs of 2. I am just cooking for one person. 

2. This product is a plant-based meat alternative made mainly of oats. We want to know the best way to name this product. At the moment, they are called “Oat Patties” or “Oat Balls.” What are your thoughts on this? Would you name them differently to be more compelling? 

Oat Balls could be something for animals e.g. oat balls for birds, so I am not too taken by this word. 

Oat Patties restricts them to being a replacement for meat burgers and used as a beef burger substitute. Although, I prefer patties to balls. 

Could you call them Oat fritters, cutlets, rounds, burgers?

3. What would actually make you want to try these patties & balls? Is there anything else that these would need to have for you to choose them over other meat / meat alternative products? 

Are these products GM-free?
Are all the ingredients locally sourced?
What is their carbon footprint?

If they are GM-free, local sourced and with a low carbon footprint. I would be interested. I also hope the packaging is locally sourced and sustainable. 

If they taste really good - full of flavour and moist, I would prefer them. Often veggie burgers can be way too dry. 

Also, how about some more interesting flavours? What about using Harissa, Sambal etc? What about Jamaican flavours, Moroccan, India? How about using flavours reflective of all the cultures in the UK. 

Why not supply them with dips or complementary or recommended sauces and flavours?

I do want to try them but feel the flavours need to be more interesting. 

4. Show and tell us about 2-3 brands that you believe Elovena’s Oat Patties & Balls would be competing against in your local supermarket.   1. What are your initial reactions to the Elovena packaging? 

They are still old fashioned. Why do you need a blond, white lady representing the brand?

2. Is this new packaging design compelling enough for you to pick it up off the shelf at your local supermarket? Why / why not? 

It does stand out from other oat packaging but not in a good way. It is likely being transported back to the 50s. I just think it needs a bold design with a focus on natural colours that represent nature. The navy blue does not depict nature. The colour palate needs to be more earthy imho. I also think there could be fewer colours. 

The images of the product look very fake and not authentic. 

Also, clear packaging so you can see the product before you buy it. 

3. Looking at the designs above, what three words do you think best describe Elovena's packaging? 

Really old fashioned 

Sorry but they are. 1. It is an old fashioned Finnish brand produce healthy oat products for the older generation.  2. Probably the oats that you just need to add boiling water to. They are so convenient. I already eat oats for breakfast but I don't have a microwave, so it is an inconvenience to find milk to add to it and cook it in a pan.  3. I think the brand needs to project the image of nature or cool. There is already Oatly representing cool oat drink products e.g. www.oatly.com, which could be ""copied"" if you want the millennials, and also brands like Graze that look natural.  http://bit.ly/2ZfkmsS Why not launch through a community of advocates/ambassadors that produce content and spread the word? 
 Why not collaborate with places that sell breakfast on the go to launch your porridge? They could sell a ""pimped"" version of it during the winter months.  I think something could be learnt from the way Oatly does its product launches into new markets and some brands that are really social media savvy e.g.  https://www.instagram.com/glossier/",Goldilocks,INTJ
396610,Armon,Yazdi,ayazdi387@gmail.com,"I feel overall very happy with these changes . I always try to find the silver lining but I whole heartedly believe that these changes have added to my life and contributed to my growth and what makes me who I am . I spend alot of time outdoors some of the activities include, gold Panning, walks,hikes,reading under a tree , and just sitting enjoying being surrounded by nature . Recently my attitude towards being outside has changed in as positive way. I feel much mor comfortable outside in fresh air alone than I do inside . I know it is because of the virus, I always have suffered from anxiety germaphobia and OCD and the virus has made it worse . By spending time outside I ease that and feel more comfortable and safe. The two things that bring me the most joy when I am outdoor is Gold Panning and Gardening. I live gold Panning for so many reasons, I enjoy spending time outside surrounded by nature and the sound of the water , the peace I feel is indescribable. So to feel that peace and then add on the adrenaline and excitement of finding a peice of bright glimmering gold makes it the perfect hobby for me. It has had a huge impact on my happiness and the same goes for Gardening . I enjoy gardening because it involves you working hard sweating and spending time outside . Also you get to nourish and actually watch the fruits of your labor grow right before your eyes . Nothing is better than homegrown organic fruits and vegetables and I love the idea that I can grow them myself and actually my dream is to have a huge garden or farm one day . I think if I were to have answers this question a year ago my answer would have been different. last year I was living a different type of active lifestyle , always working always on the go , so this year I have hff and more time and made myself and my happiness and health a priority The memory I'm going to tell you about items a memory from about 2 weeks ago and it is of when my neighbor ""P"" and I went gold Panning   at Cherry Creek. It was still early in the morning so there was a crapnessbin the air that made it slightly chilly as we departed . We walked about a mile from our starting point and in just that time the sun had risen and it had gotten much hotter and brighter.  We arrived at "" our spot "" a place we had been many times and was quite familiar to us . It was at the base of a water fall on a tiny island in the middle of the stream.  The water was cold and felt good contrasting to the heat of the day and was about a foot deep where we were ,and pretty gently flow. We got our pans and shovels and collecting containers that we would use to store our treasure in ready . I walked around in the water enjoying the beautifull day and sounds of water and birds as well as the cold flow around my ankles . I found a spot and bemused my shovel to fill my pan. My heart started to race as I shook the pan until only the heaviest and smallest peices of sand remained .. bow cane the part I loved the most. I slowly sifted through the material at the bottom of my pan and .... a huge shiny beautifull flake of gold poked through I went to get it and found another then another and another. We repeated this process until total exhaustion and when we ran out of water we packed it up and headed home . This was one of the best memories of my life .I love nature so to spend the Monday outside in the water it great enough but finding gold is just the icing on an already sweet cake. A few sources of wich I draw inspiration and motivate me to live an active outdoor lifestyle , is just trying to keep old ways and traditions alive , for example I love gardening and growing my own food just as people have done since the beginning of time I feel it's a more natural and healthy way to live .. I read history books and go to museums and live seeying the ways people used to live without much modern technology. Another source that inspires and motivates me is watching nature and survival / remote living documentaries. I really look up to and admire people that live off the grid and off the land 100 percent and that is one of my longterm goals in life. Lastly my family and friends both online and in real life, Everyone I am surrounded by all shares a similar passion for the outdoors . We share experiences with each other tips and things we've learned . We also go places with each other and all motivate and inspire each other to one degree or another . The brand I chose is REI , I say this brand because it is a brand I can fully support and stand behind . From their history and how they started out ,just a group of climber friends who wanted to give people access to good quality affordable outdoor gear . I believe in their mission and the products they make are top of the line and are quality that is nearly unmatched in my opinion . They also have become more than just a brand and company, they now have become a community for people who all share the same passion for the outdoor and active lifestyle, they offer tips and expert advice on their website .after seeing this I was prompted to scroll through their website and started looking at all the gear I wanted and making a wishlist in my head , I also send a friend a link to something's I thought he would like and that promoted is to start talking and even begin loosely planning our next adventure. I think Hydroflask can make itself meaningfull and relevant by sympathizing with people and what they are going through . They can emphasize how important health is now more than ever and how their brand and products can help you live a healthy active lifestyle. I think they can relay how important water and staying hydrated is when your being active and next in general. Show how people are spending more time outdoors and how their product will help with that . Just be real and be in it for the right reasons and helping people . I also feel it may be good to start a program where a small percentage of profits go to help people who have been effected by covid. I lived the way they started it , with a powerful emotional moment. You could feel the emotion and once they had your attention they proceeded.  I liked again how they showed that they are really about making a change and uplifting people I really liked this and I was flooded with memories that were triggered and left with a smile and a happy feeling and feeling motivated.  I also like the message it portrayed about pushing yourself facing your fears and ultimately surprising yourself with what you are capable of.  I already feel like I can feel good about supporting this company and what they are about.  The only thing I would say is maybe just shorten it a tiny bit the beginning and ending were phenomenal but just trim a little fat in the middle.  But still really great . As some ik me who loves the outdoors I want to do anything I can to help preserve it , but alot of the time you dont know where to start.  I like how they are showing you that by using your product you wont be just buying a product you will be helping and doing your part In not adding to the destruction of our planet. It is a clear consise message i think it was well done . I would think it may help to add in a statistic about how many bottles the average person throws away in a year . Other than that it was really good . My first impression was a smile immediately cam across my face . I love the video that is shown and the message behind it which o believe is to be mindful and find joy in life's little moments. I also like the fact that it gives the consumer a chance to interact with the company and each other and share some of their fond memories. It gives you a feeling of connection and community rather than just a sales and customer relationship. It shows they arent just after your money they.",Flux,
334691,Kirsten,Riccardi,kirstenriccardi@gmail.com,"Reflecting on these changes has some positive aspects as well as some negative. I love the fact that I can spend time with family now that I’ve moved back to my hometown. I’m grateful that I can go on hikes with my dog and explore. I’ve taken up a good routine with yoga to help with stress. On the other hand it’s really sad to see things like collaboration, music, movies, and production caught in limbo. Nevertheless, it is a marathon of patience and I’m looking forward to when theaters can reopen safely and we can all socialize again. It’s deeply important that the arts survive this pandemic so for now I look at this time as a time to incubate and work on new skills at home. Lots of home improvements and quaility time with family! I’ve always been an outdoorsy person. Although I grew up in a city and have lived in urban environments I have always had the privilege of getting out to the country and being taught to appreciate nature. 2020 has cemented my passion for nature and science and growth to an extent that has shifted my focus within my career. I’m so thankful for what a hike can give me and it became clear when we weren’t allowed outside for weeks due to the air quality from the wildfires in California. The notion “you don’t know what you have until it’s gone” really resonated. I look forward to my walks, I stop and notice the beauty of nature. Just as they say in Japan about “forest bathing” being good for your mental and physical health, I have grown more calm when I can explore wilderness. My appreciation for nature and the immense amount of knowledge to be gained from observing it has given me a lot of strength to deal with the overwhelming aspects of the pandemic. I’ve even began to collect herbs and have experimented with aromatherapy which has been lovely! 1. Walking my dog and hiking.
2. I’m happy when my dog is happy and she makes me laugh a lot. It’s nice to say hello to other dog owners too- a brief conversation satisfies that social need we have as humans. Hiking is so satisfying because it’s physical and emotional. You work out climbing steep hills and then have this amazing pay off at the end with views and spontaneous animal sightings. I get a thrill out of exploring new parks and hiking trails there is so much to observe and appreciate. It’s an effective and healthy distraction from politics and worry.
3. I’m sure the need would be less strong. The curiosity would still exist but the need for it would be less clear because I would be spending time with friends and work and other cultural outlets like restaurants or music shows. I think my heart is in a different place than it was before. We have limited opportunities now so that creates a deeper relationship with being outdoors and tuning in with nature. I’m more grateful than I was before just by the disciplined approach to maintaining my health. That being said, it’s not like I am able to keep a positive outlook all the time. I often get knocked off track by emotional hurdles or fear of what I’m reading in the news. Being outdoors has been a tremendous support for getting back on track each time. 1. Marin Headlands, with my long term friend Sarah, we met for a hike and picnic with my dog Umami.
2. I felt a little nervous because we were going to a new place and I always get a little nervous when I don’t know what to expect for my dog and if she can run around freely and safely. When we started driving over the Golden Gate Bridge I felt myself relax as I was enjoying the views and the warm weather, which is unusual for San Francisco- especially at the bridge. I was happy to see my friend Sarah who has been very isolated during this time because she has asthma. We enjoyed a wonderful walk along the coast and along the beach a bit and sat down for a view and a small picnic of dried mango, olives, cheese, crackers and a little wine and beer. It was exactly what I needed! I felt so fulfilled to have a conversation with a peer and to experience the comfort of a few hours of socializing.
3. It honestly made me feel less alone. I felt comforted by the fact that my friend felt a similar way to me during these stressful weeks leading up to our presidential election. We got to talk about our relationships too, which was relieving. I think as women especially, we bond a lot over intimate conversation so having these open discusssions felt very freeing. We also got to share in our observations of seals and birds and history. We laughed about our 6th grade field trip to this same place, a memory I had completely forgotten about until that moment. I felt really connected to the land and to my childhood, which was refreshing. Plus, my dog had a spendid time so that made it all so worth it! My parents introduced me to the outdoors, as well as the schools I attended. I remember as a kid going to REI, a camping store, and crawling inside tents and pretending we were camping. We had a telescope as well, my Dad really liked to stargaze and talk about planets. We always had a strong concept about being on a planet inside a vast universe. I was very lucky. We’ve had many articles of clothing made by Patagonia and so I think I have a sentimental attachment to that brand. Birkenstock’s as well, have been a staple in my family and so I just think about being barefoot by a river with my family when I wear them. We used to take family bike rides too- all seven of us would pile into our VW vanagon bus and drive out of the city for a bike ride. Peugeot, Nishiki, Schwinn, Trek, all bike brands I like, with a brook saddle (bike seat) makes you feel like an urban cowboy because the leather is the closest thing you’ll ever get to the saddle on a real horse. I think of the Olive Oil Company in St. Helena where we would buy olives, bread, and salami for a picnic after the ride. This place was wallpapered with business cards from floor to ceiling and I think it’s probably exactly the same all these years later. I used to work at a redwood national park called Muir Woods. I would drive over the Golden Gate Bridge every day to sell tickets and books to people who wanted to see the ancient redwoods. It was probably one of the best jobs I’ve ever had for my heart but not for my wallet. I still draw a great deal of inspiration from the Golden Gate conservancy sites like this one. We had a lot of National Geographic magazines in our house growing up too but these days I usually tune into David Attenborough television shows instead. Road trips are inspiring, traveling outside of what you see on a daily basis is very refreshing for me. When I don’t have the time to drive too far I usually go to Glen Park Canyon near my house. I walk through the eucalyptus trees and take some trails up along the ridge. I watch the fog roll in the way you watch the tide at the beach. It somehow never gets old. That’s the beauty of nature, it never bores me. Never. Then I work up an appetite and go bbq outside in the overgrown garden until the sun goes down. I have this visceral relationship with fire, bonfires, bbq, anything that burns is very exciting to me and I have many times been drawn to ask people if they want to go have a bonfire at the beach or go camping just to sit around a fire. I don’t know why but it just feel very sayisfying to decompress in front of a fire instead of watching too much TV! a. A new brand I like is Madera Outdoor Company from Wyoming. I was looking for a hammock to send to my boyfriend and this company came up online.
b. It caught my eye because with each product you buy they plant one tree. Also, I liked the designs of the hammocks a lot- they had lightweight ones and ones that were very artistic. I appreciated the wide range of styles and the commitment to plant trees.
c. Photo attached 
d. I bought a hammock and sent it to London, then I bought one for myself in San Francisco, then I bought some coffee from a roasters they partner with who also plants trees and ethically sources their coffee (Wilderness Roasters), plus I got a free gift from Madera- an awesome Alaskan knife :)

Ps- I also just finally bought a pair of Blundstone boots. Been wanting these for easily 5 years. Very outdoorsy and still urban, I like their tagline of “everywhere life takes me” plus they’ve been making boots for 150 years! I would love to see some of the purchase go to help people who need clean water. Or, to educate how we can get involved with standing up for communities that need support in demanding clean water sources. At this point I think we all know that plastic water bottles are harmful to our planet but what people don’t really know is that our recycling system is in shambles. When we think we’re sending our used plastic bottles to be recycled they’re actually going into landfills. Education and Action are so important and it’s really overwhelming so maybe small little droplets or information can cause a ripple effect :wink: I’m crying! I used to rock climb a lot- and actually worked at my college climbing wall so it brings back a lot of memories. That scary feeling of your first climb makes you want to run for the hills but learning that it will have a tremendous boost of confidence in the end makes it more than worth it. It’s so wonderful to see a program like this, it makes me want to work for them! I really liked the school setting with the teacher and then to be able to watch this class go outdoors and challenge themselves to climb outdoors- awesome. It’s horrible that our youth can’t feel safe playing outdoors because it’s truly unsafe. We have a lot of work to do in regards to that. Seeing how supportive of each other they were, that’s what really struck a chord in me. They were able to build off of each other instead of compete with each other. That’s so inspiring and truly does make me want to pursue this kind of work or at the very least participate in supporting this brand. I usually have more critical things to say but the only question I have is where this 5 min video will be shared. It’s a little long as a commercial but it has a well rounded story and very informative, so I wouldn’t cut it down. Just watched it again... why is it that we never actually see a hydro flask? It seems that the national park trust is more highlighted based off the kids wearing those beanies.  How does it work in regards to how I might help contribute to this program? When I buy a hydro flask do some of the proceeds go to this grant program? “I wasn’t afraid of falling, I was afraid of not getting to the top” great line, very inspirational <3 Fantastic. It’s bold and it’s clear. The #refillchallenge made me wonder if there was an actual challenge to participate in, similar to the ice bucket challenge, which I think is not helpful because it’s sort of a one hit wonder. It’s actually not a challenge to refill an eco friendly bottle, it’s a challenge to stop yourself from buying a bottle of cold water when you’re out and about and have limited funds. If hydroflasks were sold in the same section as water bottles and there was a way to fill it there on the spot then I think a lot less bottles of water would be sold. It’s the convenience that dominates the endless buying of plastic water bottles. I’d like to see more public water fountains so that I knew I could refill my bottle when needed. If buying a hydro flask meant that somehow I was supporting those types of public works I would be thrilled. 

#moneyphonelipglosskeys is what we used to say before leaving the house, it really was helpful but also a silly joke between roommates ... now I’m thinking #hydromoneyphonelipglosskeys is the new before-you-leave-the-house recall :) especially because it saves you money!!  #weare70percentwater #keepitthatway #feelsgoodtorefill #helpmehelpyou #fountainoflife #refeel hahaha that one actually made me laugh. If hydro flask could be marketed as super clean and bacteria free that might be helpful too because I think a lot of people are discouraged from plastic when they learn about how germ-prone they are. A. I’m a sucker for dog videos so of course I had a little chuckle and grin. That sort of was fleeting... maybe there could be a word associated with it to add some education like for example here it could be “symbiosis” and then the definition.
B. The tricky part about seeing funny little videos like this is that for people who might be feeling isolated or maybe just have a little bit of FOMO it can be a double edged sword. What I mean is that it can bring joy momentarily but then cause sadness.
C. I think if it could connect to something productive and creative that would be neat. Like, here it could be a link to a video of how to to make your own rope swing safely or maybe some interesting facts about Australian Shepherds or a link to adopt them! Another idea might be opening up the chance to participate with that video like adding dialogue to it, I can imagine some funny comic book dialogue bubbles on this video or maybe just a free word association game. The point I’m trying to explore is how these videos can connect people so they don’t feel left out or more lonely than they did before. Last idea might be an incentive to play, like if your video is chosen or your reaction to it is chosen then some pennies go to a specific need. It always feels great to make a difference, no matter how small.",Flux,
252388,Sachie,Uchimaru,suchimaru@gmail.com,"I didn't realize there were so many things I am doing now everyday that were not a part of my life a mere 7 months ago. I feel like they are deeply a part of my life now, I cna't imagine not doing these things everyday (like my morning exercise routine). Looking at this I'm a little nervous even about how I will adjust back when we do go back to working in the office and the kids going back to school! There is no way I can fit all of this in! After Covid i have started taking daily walks in the neighborhood just to get out. I have 2 kids at home and as the mother I find myself constantly taking care of them, so leaving the house to be outdoors is a way to mentally take care of myself to have a ""break"" from mothering, and focusing on myself. So the outdoors has become a mental escape for me. Interesting enough is I think I only realized this benefit only after my initial motivation which was physical (to get my ""steps"" in). So I guess I am saying that while physical health was my initial association with ""being outdoors,"" it is actually just as helpful or even more helpful for my mental health. This must be the same for my children too, if I'm having this experience 1. I enjoy going on walks by myself for a long time (30minutes-1 hour)
2. It is important to me for the reasons I put in the earlier slide, for my mental health to get a break from the kids. But it brings me joy because it is a time I listen to podcasts, something that I have always been keen to do in my pre-covid life but never had the time to do. I enjoy learning, that is something that I have discovered in Covid that is something that brings me joy, and podcasts allow me to learn. 
3. I don't think I would have discovered this about myself (that I like to learn) becuase I felt like I didn't have enough time to listen to podcasts. I have always been a book reader, but somehow the act of listening to podcasts and walking all by myself really allows me to focus on the material. 

1. I enjoy playing sports with my son 
2. I think this is the primary way that I can bond with my preteen son who is not a big talker. Bonding with him brings me immense joy 
3. Again goes back to time. We were far less focused on bonding with the kids, and instead more focused on taking them to activities to ""help them grow"", and then what little time we had left we focused that on socializing with other families (aka our friends) I am in a small surfing town in NorCal called Bolinas, I am with my son (12 years old), his friend and his mother. We have decided to visit them over a long weekend, we quarantined to prepare for this rare in person treat. We decided to go play tennis in the nearby courts. 

I felt a little nervous since we haven't played tennis together in over a year. But I also felt very excited because this is a sport that both my son and I enjoy, and there are fewer and fewer things that both my son and I enjoy together anymore. During the tennis I felt SUPER happy. I felt engaged, bonded, and content. 

It meant to me that we should make time for these moments because in the end how much our children bond with us is going to help them become content human beings, and therefore ""successful"" in life. It also made me realize I'm more competitive than I thought!

I don't have any photos of this day unfortunately. But I feel like this is actually a good thing, usually I'm ""not in the moment"" because I think about taking photos to upload to social media. This must have meant that it was so enjoyable I didn't think about interrupting it to take photos! I have a subscription now (since Covid) to Real Simple, Time, and People magazine (guilty pleasure). These magazines do give me some inspiration and ideas on what to do to keep my mind and body active. 

I certainly look to my friends primarily through social media (facebook, instagram) to see what they are doing for themselves and for their kids to help them stay active. Mothering is a communal effort these days, we can't rely on our extended family to give us advice any more, so I often rely on my friends with kids to see what they are doing. Sports Basement 
This is a local sports equipment store that I'm not sure qualifies as a ""brand"", but it was the first and actually only one that came to mind when I thought of an outdoor lifestyle store that I have positive feelings towards. Other brands I just look at them as merchandise (pure money interaction), and actually I conjur up an image of a skinny White woman in her 20s wearing their stuff. Sports Basement is different--they seem genuinely invested in improving the health of ALL people in San Francisco, they do a lot of charity work where they donate money to local schools (waaaaay before Covid) and other charities. Right now for instnace they are donating money to the people impacted by the wildfires. And on their instagram page are pictures of people of color way more than skinny white ladies! I also love how they seem invested in helping families bond via outdoors or exercise. They have events catered to families, from music concerts for kids to little marathons for them. 
If I ever have to go in store to buy anything ""outdoors"" or sports related, I always have picked them. Now I am more prone to go to them instead of hopping on Amazon to help them survive. The biggest thing for me is you have to be relevant for ALL people. Traditionally, I think people thought of activities like camping or even to a more extreme example, white river rafting, or surfing as things that are associated with ""active outdoor brand."" These things are usually things that people of means (both time and money) can afford to do, hence outdoor brands have traditionally marketed towards middle class/upper class White people. Now in Covid, we now have more time AND we NEED to be outdoors for both our physical and mental health. This is true for a wider range of demographics than before. So people are engaging in outdoor activities like hiking, or just taking walks, that don't entail pricey equipment or driving somewhere far. So the biggest advice I would give is to put people on your ads that seem REAL. That aren't super skinny and ""attractive"". Pictures of maybe some slightly overweight people engaging in physical exercise, especially with their kids and families. Because that is what ""being active"" in 2020 looks like. And DEFINITELY people of color. We are no longer the ""minority"". 1. I really liked it.  it told me that Hydroflask cares about everyone's physical and mental health, not just making the most money. It tells me that it is passionate about the idea that everyone engages in outdoor activities and sharing in the joy that it brings. 
2. I really liked that it was a short movie, not just a 30 second clip. It gave me connection to the kids, especially some of the kids they kept showing over and over. I loved seeing their excitement, their smiles, their energy. I loved the idea first of all that kids are being given the opportunity to take part in these activities that they may not have done on their own. 
Some things I didn't like- I didn't like the metal detector wand part--it clearly associates the idea of danger and thus criminality, in a Black school, therefore causing implicit (or explicit bias) in the viewer- black people=dangerous. I also didn't like how most of the adults that were helpers in the movie except the teacher were White. It again reinforces (implicitly) the idea that White people save Black people. I really like the visual-the idea that it is truly replacing plastic water bottles is clear, and I think the idea is an important one. I also like the colors- really visually pleasing and the blue definitely associates you with water. 
I think there are kind of a lot of hashtags at the bottom... Do we really need all of them? maybe select 2 or 3 so people would actualy read them-when I see a sea of hashtags I never stop to read them, but when there are only a few I do. First impression was that it was supposed to be posting anything that brought you joy, which is a great idea given COVID has sucked the joy out of a lot of people and science shows that focusing on the positive and having gratitude is the way to overcome negativity. I didn't realize it was supposed to be moments of joy in the outdoors until I saw the video, so somehow making that more explicit would be good. Otherwise you might just have a lot of people posting pictures of their dog or their babies indoors. 
I liked just watching the video-it brought ME joy watching the dog and kid. I didn't like how vague it was as I mentioned above about the link to the outdoor part. 
I think if the video comes first, and then the image of the words, it would catch my eye more. I usually don't pay attention (at least emotionally) to a thing with words but I certainly would have watched the video",Flux,ISFJ
396609,Laura,Rose,lauraoshun@gmail.com,"Honestly, with reference to my active lifestyle, Actions haven't changed, so much as the WAY I go about doing them. I still exercise and partake in yoga as regularly as possible, but it is a different method. I need to xo these activities at home, instead of in classes with other participants. Going outside to get some fresh air, involves wearing a mask - something I wouldn't equate with fresh air. Scheduling alone time is something I have also done with regularity, but it is even more important now, given that I feel like I have way more responsibilities while working from home - I am a teacher and much more of a chef than I was hitherto the pandemic.

I wish some things could return to normal quickly- like my exercise classes, which I miss terribly, but I am happy that there are other ways to take part in these things and that they have not completely come to a halt. Exercising regularly and getting fresh air, daily.
I used to work out in a gym, most often. Now I workout at home or outdoors. I never really used to workout outdoors, because the gym was my haven, with all of its amenities. I have always enjoyed the outdoors, and it's become a space for me to do many other things tat I normally would nit have done on a regular basis, such as exercising and cooking- we have been cooking outdoors at least a couple of times per week since this all started. a-not being stuck inside
b- It's important for me to breathe in air aside from the air inside the walls of my residence, feel the sun on my skin, get Vitamin D.
c- This year, I guess I feel a bigger sense of gratefulness as a result of having been in a lockdown for several months. I've always enjoyed the outdoors, but even more so now.

a-interacting with other people, even if it's 6 feet away.
b-It's important to remember there are more humans out there. I know on the surface, this sounds silly, but I get real joy from conversing with my neighbors and seeing other forms of life- people, animals aside from just watching them on my TV and seeing my family.
c- This year, I definitely have a greater sense of this longing and the need. A year ago, I would have not felt this way. It really took losing this ability for a few weeks to understand how important it is to me. I actually miss TOURISTS! As a life-long NY'er, I have always HATED them, but now that they're not here, I really wish they would come back. They helped make this city feel alive too. A-It was in our front yard. I was with my husband and 2 children. We were decorating for Halloween, which involved hanging lights on the roof - something I volunteered to do.
B-I feel excited and happy throughout, but I guess at first, I was anxious about making sure the lights would work and that I didn't fall off the ladder. When we were done, I was happy and thought we had all done a great jib, especially my daughter who made a very impressive scarecrow.
C-This activity gave me a warm, happy feeling inside in knowing that my husband and I had made our kids happy, that we brought a little joy to the neighborhood and that we were still engaging in ""normal"" holiday activities.
D-I'm very grateful for having been able to do this and I look forward to doing things like this for the rest of this year's holidays too. I look to Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and local news, which has been great at keeping me abreast of all the events taking place locally outdoors. A-I chose Coleman
B-I chose it because my family and I love to go camping several times per year when it's warm out, and most of our camping equipment is from Coleman. Since I love the brand, I follow them on social media and they have been posting lots of great pictures of being outdoors and engaging in active activities like camping, hiking, cycling and climbing.
C-I posted a picture I liked from their Instagram page below. The sun shining through the trees really spoke to me, as I have been fortunate enough to wake up this way, on many occasions during many camping trips. It brought a sense of serenity, peace and nostalgia.
D-They had posted this picture back in July and later that month, I got a couple of my other parent friends to commit to a socially safe camping trip with their children and us. Being outdoors is probably the safest way we can be active during this pandemic. If I could tell the team at HydroFlask something about this, I would emphasize the need for accessories that would help one carry their hydro flask more easily while doing outdoor activities, the cleanliness of the bottles if they do repel bacteria, and the portability aspect-keeping your beverages hot or cold for many hours. I LOVE metal water bottles, but they are not easy to clean, in my opinion. I would love to find a metal water bottle that could keep beverages cold or hot for many hours AND could be washed in the dishwasher so that they could easily get sanitized. A- This is so sweet and inspirational. I liked following the children as they got through school and talked about what their aspirations were and then watching them tackle rock climbing and conquer their fears.
B-I loved learning that Hydro Flask had made donations to make these things happen for the children and to support parks. I disliked nothing about this video. It was uplifting and positive.
C-It was positive enough for me, as is, but maybe they could show more outdoor footage. Like if this was a commercial, the first couple of minutes were dedicated to the kids in their classrooms, I might not know this had anything to do with Hydro Flask or the outdoors. Maybe they can somehow out those details in at he beginning. A- I love it. It's so very relevant for today, when we literally have islands of plastic waste floating in our oceans and recycling doesn't happen as much as most consumers think it does. We need to stop using plastic bottles to help curb pollution. I am all for this.
B-I think is so cleaver meaningful as is, but the same way the bottom parts of the plastic bottle are changing, I would change the colors of the Hydro Flask bottle as well for aesthetic appeal. A-The visual of the dog is adorable. It says this brand is joyful and positive.
B-It's cute, but it kind of looks like a lot of content on social media and doesn't really stand out.
C- I think they need to spell out the name. It's so short, I would miss the Hydro Flask logo because it doesn't show us the actual name.",Flux,
397249,Scott,Chagnon,scchagnon@mac.com,"In October 2019, I started to wrap my head around the fact that I was turning 50 in May 2020.  I wanted to hit 50 sprinting as my best self. So instead of saying, “hey, pull yourself together...” I first decided to pull myself apart. I stripped down to my essentials — determined that my best self would be fueled by six essentials: sleep, nutrition, movement, meditation, mindfulness and connections. I also identified the ingredients to each essential — those daily activities that would go into cultivation a healthy essential. 

I began 2020 with the framework in place and 30+ days of a trial and error process to inform my daily practices for the new year. Motivated, encouraged and clear with intent I enthusiastically jumped in to the new year... and started to reinforce behaviors through experiencing positive results. But as March started to roll around, I found the nuisances of every day life getting in the way of my essentials practice.  Results slowed a bit. Old habits started to creep back in. Motivation seemed to quiet. Then COVID. Things shut down and I found myself working from home.

I used to be a cyclist (in my 30s). I noticed when faced with an upcoming hill, most of the other cyclists decelerated into the hill — some didn’t even realize they were doing it... it was almost just a natural reaction.  I found that if I accelerated into the hill I would not only generate momentum to propel up but I could create a gap between me and my competitors every time. 

When COVID hit, I knew that it represented an opportunity to accelerate. While others paused, hesitated, I identified the “time savings” and reinvested that time to further (and add to) my essentials. For example, the 25 min AM drive to work was replaced by a yoga class. My lunch mtgs at local diners were replaced by healthy, keto friendly meals.  Meetings with my team in a conference room were replaced by walking meetings in the sunshine over Zoom.

How do I feel about the changes?  Amazing and thankful. The reinvestment and reprioritization of time has definitely changed my mindset/attitude towards the outdoors. Mostly, the outdoors was a means to an end — to get indoors.  Routine was home garage to parking deck — enduring the elements and/or watching the sunshine from the comforts of the car. Well, this is a bit of a dramatic statement but contains elements of a sad reality. On a nice night where there were no mosquitoes and everyone was comfortable with the evening temperature we would sit outside for dinner.  And typically on week nights we would travel or go out to eat with friends (indoors).  But the COVID impact and changes in how I use my time have made outdoors a desired destination and prioritization. Even if it is 10 minutes to get up from a zoom call I find myself walking outside to stretch and enjoying the sun. Morning workouts no longer happen at the gym they happen on my back patio. Dining at restaurants is exclusively outside — we just feel more comfortable that way. Jumping rope outside. I enjoy the physical activity and it represents one of my six essentials, movement. I used to be more active at a gym or would skip all together because of travel time and work.  With no travel time and not having to take my daughter to school, I can spend that time being active outside in the morning. 

Just getting a little mid day sun. We know absorbing the sun in reasonable doses is good for you. But who has the time to come out of the office tower for a 10 min sun break. Well, now, with work from home it is so convenient to just walk outside and soak up some sun. And it feels great. Grounding. Calming. Warming. Resets the day. Zoom.  The word used to inspire forward movement and exhilaration.  Today, the word brings about a feeling of confinement, the spinning of poor connection and the repetition of the phrase, “you are on mute.”

So to offset the emotions of today’s Zoom, I go outside and soak up the sun. 10 minutes to just stand tall, open the arms wide, look up and feel the warmth of the sun on my cheeks.  The warm glow penetrates down my entire body and invigorates the soul — channels the original feelings of Zoom — movement and exhilaration. 

And there is an after glow. The warmth, the vibes continue through the next few Zoom calls until the weight of the screen brings the body back to crouched position and eyes return to a blank stare. Biohacking. I’m fascinated by those outsiders, “the crazy ones,” that boldly believe they will live to 140 years old. And are willing to bend the realities of traditional science and medicine in order to pursue and “hack their way” to new possibilities. 

Dave Aspery, CEO of Bulletproof, is on point for this movement. His book, Super Human, offers the blueprint.  His bulletproof lifestyle guides on his website provide the practical tools to get started. And his podcast introduces you to all the other leaders in this ecosystem  — Jim Kwik, Limitless; Rick Hanson, NeuroDharma; Jay Shetty, Think Like a Monk; and others. This biohacking tribe inspires new mindsets and toolsets to live a healthy lifestyles well into your mid 100s. This question made me pause and think for a moment... and then Patagonia popped in my head. 

I’ve never owned any of their products. For some reason other outdoor brands came to mind when making purchasing decisions — namely Columbia, Eddie Bauer, Northface, Orvis, etc.  I think maybe those brands easily came to mind because of traditional mail catalogs and store locations. My most recent purchase was a Columbia coat I bought in NYC last Fall. Beautiful coat. Loved it. But, sadly, lost it late winter. Was so disappointed but committed to buying another one this Fall. 

I had some money left on a Nordstom gift card so I decided to search and see if the sold Columbia jackets in the Nordstrom.com store.  So I go online, search winter jackets, and I don’t see Columbia but I did see Patagonia. And I had a positive feeling about the brand. And I wasn’t sure why... then I remembered the article I read about the Patagonia tag — vote the assholes out. Yes, love that. BRILLIANT.  That’s all I needed to influence my purchasing decision. Take a stand for the greater good.  Parks for all.  Yes!  That is something I can connect to and align my values. 

Don’t be vanilla. Don’t water things down. Don’t play the middle. Take a stand on what you believe in and share it with the world. The consumers that connect to those values will love you, follow you, and buy your products. As long as what they hear/read/see is authentic to your actions. 

Share your beliefs in an upbeat, positive, greater good kind of way.  Show us aspirational but real. I watched the video on the coffee mug. I want a new coffee mug. And the video reminded me of what I’m missing during COVID and what I can’t wait to get back to. We are headed to Asheville NC next week. And after watching the video I was reading to experience the great outdoors again — the sun, the cool weather, layers. Yes. Excited. Long. But overall compelling. It has potential content to create a two minute video that makes an impact. Really could be sliced into three supporting versions — from three kids perspectives. 

The message is great. Love the story. It really is amazing to see what the kids accomplish.  

Also the music is really good. 

The let’s go theme is a winner. I like the endless reference. And the visual of what’s filling the landfill. The split reference is very effective. Out of the three things I’ve seen so far, this one is the most visually appealing. Gets the point across clearly and quickly— and most importantly highlights the value proposition of the product. Video isn’t engaging. If I watched it outside of this exercise I would have just moved on and not given it a second thought.  Couldn’t really see the person’s face. Need to see a smile and feel the joy.  The face first appears in the shadow. 

Have a video that shows the facial expression of joy.  

I do like the inclusion of a dog.",Flux,
296557,Lucja,Leonard,runningdutchie@hotmail.com,"I miss my running community! Especially as I’m quite transient, I miss this opportunity to meet people. This combined with no races either is very lonely. I have met a few people on trails and made a couple of friends, only a couple though, as people are more on guard and unapproachable. With out the races I’ve felt my motivation wane as well so I’ve lost fitness and gained weight which is not only frustrating but not great for my mental health or overall health. I have kind of enjoyed the virtual challenges as something to do but it just doesn’t have the same driver for me to be fully invested. I miss that human contact, the competitive spirit and I miss the hugs and high fives, I really do. I never thought twice about high giving strangers on training runs and hugging friends old and new and I miss it. I’m not even a very touchy geeky person but I feel my body craving that closeness from others. On the plus side I’ve enjoyed connecting with an online audience through social media in the way of doing HIIT sessions both live and prerecorded videos. I feel happy and proud to be motivating and helping others this way which is something I wouldn’t have done previously because I hadn’t thought of it. Run, group runs, ultras, sup boarding, hiking, walking the dog, races, walking everywhere, cycling, hiking
My mindset has changed slightly in terms of not taking the freedom to access it for granted. This changed because of the lockdown period where access was denied which made me angry and sad. It’s also made me appreciate the number restrictions now in place in some areas and feel this could be implemented more as some places are just over run with tourists. I feel angry at some of our newer visitors to the outdoors particularly after lockdown who have taken advantage and abused the outdoors with leaving rubbish behind. I find that very disappointing and disheartening. Adventure and fresh air. Adventure is important as it not only tests me physically but also mentally in positive ways and I can’t find the same joy indoors. Adventure makes me feel empowered, invigorated and also makes me stand out from the crowd and be able to inspire others. I love the powerful feelings this invokes. Fresh air because it makes me feel healthy, free and invigorated and I love how this makes me feel alive.
 I think I would have put the same two things down but without realising the freedom element being so important. Adventure-I’m in Dalton, Georgia with My husband Dion and dog Gobi. I’m at the start line of an actual ultra race! I’m feeling super excited as I hear those old familiar sounds of runners chatting as they head to the start line, the sound system with music and the race director announcing things over the loudspeaker. During the race I felt grateful and thankful particularly to the volunteers that were manning the aid stations and the race organisers for making this possible. I felt even when I was exhausted and wasn’t really having ‘fun’ in the moment that I needed to just suck it up and cherish the fact that I was finally having a race in 2020, even though it was already September! I felt happy throughout to be with fellow runners and was super chatty! Afterwards I felt elated to have been able to do what I love again. This activity gave me a sense of fun and adventure again, it also gave me a sense of purpose again and motivation to kick start my training.  It made me return to why I chose to race ultras to begin with, for my own well being, fun and experience. It took the pressure away if having to compete when that’s not the inner reason for doing these challenges so it was refreshing to come back to that. Inspiration comes from a lot of things, I get a lot from Instagram and Facebook of seeing what other people are doing and how creative and adventurous they are being. Some of them I know as friends but a lot of them I only know of through social. YouTube videos are also a great source of inspiration, I’ll watch a video on a race or location that I’m going too and then through the suggested videos uncover other gems. TV documentaries are also great for ideas, in particular the most recent eco challenge that was televised from Fiji has already got me thinking! Also movies like 48hrs and Dawn Wall etc are just incredible for motivation and ideas. Chatting to people at events and on line also conjures up ideas and collaborations for the future.  I don’t really read magazines anymore but this was a good medium in the past for this. I just love hearing people’s real stories and gaining inspiration from that so going to talks as well by inspiring people is another great way. A company called NUUD coughs my eye recently. https://nuudcare.nl/ firstly it was there simple social media posts that really focussed on the product being all natural, vegan, in a sugar cane tube and then I was intrigued about their claims that it was an anti odorants rather than a deodorant and you only had to apply a small pea size blob every few days for it to be effective. I’ve always had problems with odour and this has been worse by the amount of exercise I do and now also the conditions of heat and humidity and now dry heat I’m living in. I loved the way they engaged with me and were happy to offer me a free trial as they believe in their product so much. And it works!! 
Initially I think I saw their post on a sponsored ad on Instagram and the colour of the packaging and the points of interest I noted above are what drew me to seek out further information from them about the product. 
In the end I’m now a customer of them and also shared this with friends and have set up a referral code I can share with my friends too. I have not seen any of the people I follow using the product and never hear about them in general chat about products so one way is for some sort of ambassador/champion program to get people talking about it. Looking at their website they are passionate about the outdoors and giving to help support a lot of projects so it’s getting the word out about that through more involvement from ‘people’ your ambassadors would be great for that. I can’t tell whether these projects do this already or not but setting up trail work days or park work days and getting a local running/hiking/biking/park run group to support and get the numbers there to work and hand out merchandise for their work is also a good way to get more people talking about it. Being the year of virtual set up some virtual challenges on Strava, All Trails, My Fitness Pal where people can win products or discounts by doing activities in nominated parks. Another great way to connect is through what the product is made of if that is something to shout about? I couldn’t find any information on that so not sure but that is very prevalent in today’s world. From my pint of view I’d want to see how they connect with communities and the environment as a whole to make the world a better and happier place. Heartwarming and inspiring. I like it. It comes across well and makes it very clear what the success of the initiative is, where it’s impacting real people of today’s world.  It would be great to see a series of these come out so that it can connect with different people from different aspects of life not just children and families that have limited access but other minorities etc. At first I thought it was for me as a consumer to get endless free refills from somewhere. Then it made sense but needs to connect straight away. I like the simple ness of the graphics but not sure of the wording of endless refills. Initial thoughts is I like the tag, seems fun and it’s a great way to get people tagging the hashtag and noticing the brand. I like it because it’s simple, it’s fun and it’s engaging assuming they will share peoples tags on their stories. Think this would be great",Flux,
382225,Jean,Boyer,cajun0623@icloud.com,"Living an active lifestyle during covid has changed our lives dramatically. The stress of caring for so many people in the square footage of your home can be quite overwhelming. I mediate a LOT.

While We are self isolating, working from home, cannot forget the importance of taking care of ourselves !  We can always bring the exercise indoors or go outside and have activities with the family, like walking the pets or cycling outdoors.

Being proactive is also necessary. Compared to last year at this time, we are NOW wearing protective masks and standing six feet apart at any store.  

We do not have the comfort or luxury of hugging people or maintaining close contact. I walk my pets and ride my bicycle.   My mindset attitude has changed since 2020 about the outdoors in general, is that the outdoors seem to be the place where covid does NOT hit. We are human beings walking and breathing.    

Those who truly self isolate for various reasons (immune deficiencies, illness, etc)  I can understand.  However, If you are otherwise healthy, YOU are not a tree, you can move.  Look for WIN  W=What's    I=Important  N=Now.    Look at the weather, enjoy the sunshine a bike ride, the moonlight. I believe the two things that bring the most joy to me when outdoors are bicycling and walking my pet.

I enjoy cycling because I can feel t he breeze blowing through my hair, its a great outdoor sport, I can smell the senses of the weather changing.  

I also enjoy walking my pet german shepherd.  People notice us on the road, and say how a beautiful smart pet he is. He enjoys the outdoors as well.

Last year, I cycled more. I am working from home since the covid, and my activities are limited because of the lesser amount of time I have to do these things.  I have more obligations at home now since everyone is here and they are depending on me to take care of them.

I walk my dog more now because I am home. He sure enjoys it a lot and so do i :) I am out walking with my dog !  We are looking for treasures, it is trash day :)  I feel fine, my German Shepherd Roscoe, holds the beaten path of my feet and follows diligently.   Our heart rates increase as the oxygen pours within and throughout our bodies.  This moment lets all my stress and tension that has been building inside release into friendly endorphins.  It allows time for myself and my wonder dog to get outside , get healthy and enjoy each other !

=========================================================================

I am out riding my bicycle by myself. Its a social ride, but its restricted because i""m old folk here and I like to take it slow and steady, about 10 miles per hour.  I feel all energetic, all of my senses are engaged. I'm watching out for cars, loose dogs, and building up my oxygen and strength for the ride. I usually ride for one hour, which means I""m so tired yet calm and my head is cleared and I can think after my ride.

Get outdoors, Its so nice. :) I look for inspiration from my surrounding.  I have a nice window in my home office which I peer through ,our yard is beautifully landscaped.  

@covidathome

 I look for inspiration on the weather channel.  
 
https://weather.com/travel

@theweatherchannel

There are a lot of interesting places, to travel and some nearby that beckon my name !  Locally, lots of great destinations can be found on Facebook.   Think about a nice bed and breakfast for the weekend ?  How about going mudding with your 4 wheeler ?  Or for the more adventurous there is a rifle range nearby here.  

I like to watch to watch Homestead Tessie on you tube.  She lives frugal, but its her inspiration on what she can do with the land and how she takes it in depth and explains it all on a personal level and frugal budget.

I use my Street Smarts and knowledge to find local biking trails. I seriously like  a challenge, so I like to look for hills and such to meet my lifestyle demand.   

@bikingwithapurpose. I like the SPECIALIZED BRAND of Bicycle.     The brand has been around for many years. I chose this style of bicycle because I could put whatever seat, basket,  (WOMAN STUFF ::p) ON IT, and I've purchased this brand before.

https://www.competitivecyclist.com/specialized?CSPID=0916&CMP_ID=PD_BNmyDeviceIndicator=c014BR&CSPID=0916&utm_source=Bing&utm_medium=PSBR&k_clickid=_k_795e3fd5f59c1f7bd51a6056a43dadf7_k_&msclkid=795e3fd5f59c1f7bd51a6056a43dadf7&tabNav=0


:It's called a Fat Tire bike, ,made for cycling on the road, or off road, as the tires grip rather well.  I've had oodles of luck with NOT getting flats, and the tires seem to perfect my route on the road with the shock absorbers on it, translating to a smoother ride.      I think another mark that gets top marks for its credibility is that its popular with the older folks. THe bicycle has extra legroom, and my cycling shoes fit perfectly into the bicycle pedals. Just the fact that i can wear cycling shoes fits for an incredibly entirely different aspect to your ride, and works your quads something fierce.

I was instore when I purchased this brand. I was able to put on features that I wanted such as the basket and the cycling pedals.  My cycling shoes fit right into the slots on the pedas easy peasy.  I did look up the brand on social media, i look for reviews on amazon, and  although I did not see too many LOCAL people with this brand in particular, when I entered cycling events, MANY were the SPECIALIZED brand of bicycle.   i THINK the fact that I had previously owned a specialized bicycle and used it it with vigor and ease, my next option would be to purchase the same brand. I AM BRAND LOYAL :) The word ""have "" in Greek means to ""Hold ON"".  One has to have faith like a mustard seed as a BRAND in this time of covid.  There has to be a solid foundation, a solid presence on social media.   Posts can go 'viral' and your trend/BRAND can take off.  You have to have a digital platform. You have to know who your customer is and be able to contact them even if you have a retail store or not.

Being an active outdoor brand in today's world is no different.  The essence word being OUTDOOR, has its advantage from the get go. In the mindless ever ceasing land of co-vid its been practical to say that the OUTDOORS/NATURE is where you want your customer to be.   I know of a few ways to get customers if you are outdoors.  You can always hold a 'sampling event.'  Let the customer SEE AND FEEL the product.  Educate them about your BRAND, Hydro Flask.  Give away a Hydro Flask to each person attending the sampling event.  Holding onto the customer is key statement here. In Essence , the Brand = the loyalty = the acquired customer.  We can only pray each customer walks away being educated, having the product in hand and with them.  I always thought that the subliminal way, was the way to go.  Having the product / BRAND in a person's home or car, or on the go, means THEY are thinking about their purchase and OTHERS CAN SEE YOUR BRAND AS WELL = FREE ADVERTISING. 

I believe your You Tube Videos, especially the ones from t he young kids in the 'inner schools' going mountain climbing, going on that field trip, makes an impressionable mark on them. Its something they will remember for the rest of their lives. Your BRAND, how it leaves an impact on society, young and old, its ecological footprint, it all matters. 

I was SO mesmerized because this particular video on the Hydro Flask you tube channel had over ONE MILLION VIEWS !  I have  been interested in digital marketing because I watch a lot of SHARK TANK ON TV and keep doing my homework because the new brands that I see, the customers will choose to invest in THE BRAND , I want to know what your customer acquisition costs are and if its free advertising, by obtaining that social brand, and how to upsell, and to acquire those hard to reach customers who choose other brands.

There are a few ways to  deal with any customer in the world. Acquire a new one, up-sell one or make one buy more frequently. If you have their information and keep over delivering for them, then that’s what you need. You need to be able to push content out and then after that, you have to find out what more they want and create it for them.
Thats where those 'content creators' from Hydro Flask chime in.     Keep on with those you tube channels, reach out to today's youth.  Facebook. Instagram and Twitter, so so many valuable resources out there to choose from. Brand it, Build it, create it, your audience , your customer, will COME. I actually just finished telling you about this video in the last exercise !  My first impression of this video is that it is speaking to our youth, kids from the inner city getting the chance to go on a field trip to go outdoors to go rock climbing and experience Hydro Flask.  This says to  me that the BRAND is willing to step out of their comfort zone and into the inner city / schools / neighborhoods/youth to concentrate on the next biggest marketing experience. Their goal is to EDUCATE, breathe and experience the reality of the outdoors. 

I loved the purpose and plan that was in this video.  It's retelling the story for the outdoors and let the kids experience what the outdoors are like, no limits, no limitations , no boundaries. .  The scenery was breathtaking. The students all had positive energy.    I liked the message of positivity, of teaching outside of an urban setting.  

The entire field trip had a powerful prospective on the students. Students who do not know where to go, are guided in coming up with creative ways to outsource their free resource of the OUTDOORS. The brand is allowing the student to do something they have never done before. Its first hands experience at its best.  Outdoor experiences are a wonderful way to step back and rationalize that hey ""I got this'  One student said 'I feel adrenaline"".. Thats how a BRAND SHOULD FEEL AND BE. Like a sugar rush, a head rush. The student wants to 'make it to the top.', He's being cheered on.   I want this brand to make it to the top. 

I would not make any changes to the topic, brand or aim.  The students feel accomplished, and that is how I felt.  The Video was short and sweet.  It went beyond limits of imagination.  Hydro Flask, Lets Go ! Is an amazing tag line.

This video has received over a million views ! Where have I been hibernating ?   I want this BRAND. I have to have this BRAND> I was thinking  ENDLESS REFILLS, END THE LANDFILL.

  I keep thinking, and this thought keeps sticking in my mind Endless Refills, I get that part.   Yet the ENDLESS LANDFILLS PART ? is that a perceptual play on words. Landfills are NOT endless ! 

I'd like it to read something like  'ENDLESS FEFILLS  -  'LETS END LANDFILLS.""   or ""ENDLESS REFILLS 'END THE LANDFILL'.

This is a challenging concept to grab, even for me.  

Or on the other hand is the 'endless landfills ',   means having or seeming to have NO END, yet we are trying to  say 'infinite landfills"".. its just too confusing. 

I cannot grab onto this concept with positivity. Sorry. I think its cute that the dog is pulling the rope and swinging the gal, but what does it mean to me ? Fun, Joy.  What does this have to do with Hydro Flask ?   Is this just another online message the BRAND is trying to incorporate positive moments and giving people the chance to be posted on ""#MondayMomentsofJoy' ?

I think its cute to include uplifting moments for a chance to be featured.  However, the brand,, yes, its amusing and positive, but WHAT does it have in relation to the product ? 

I would like for the PRODUCT to be included in the 'chance to be featured' ad.  Thats the point right, to convey a message to the buyer.  Again, confused here.",Flux,
382227,Sam,Clark,sclark96@gmail.com,"While I do enjoy having to get creative about ways to work out, I feel a bit discouraged. Getting my workouts in was much simpler at the gym. I am much more friendly to the outdoors. I think this has changed because I have been working out outside a lot. I have been forced to get creative in ways to get my cardio in. a. being able to breath outdoor oxygen
b. I think it helps me run longer. I enjoy the endurance it helps me with.
c. It would be similar, but I wouldn't have likely been running outside this time last year because I did it on treadmills in  the gym.

a. Being able to have a scenic view while running or walking
b. It gets boring doing treadmills all the time. I enjoy the change of scenery.
c. This would be similar, but I wouldn't have had to get out of my comfort zone last year like I have to do now. I was in my neighborhood by myself on a long walk.
Before, I feel a bit anxious and down. During I start to feel alive and grateful. Afterward, I feel refreshed, enthused, and accomplished.
It gave me exercise and mental clarity. I follow athletes on social media from the NFL and NBA and seeing them workout and preform at a high level gives me lots of motivation Patagonia
I think they make great outdoor products but also are very compassionate about climate change. The CEO and company donate funds to fight climate change. I think they should stress the importance of hydration and how it is such a part of us as humans (water).

Maybe provide statistics in ads about how much better people feel when hydrated. a. It's interesting! It's very personal and evokes emotions of hope and happiness in me. It shows me thatHydroflask is all about going higher and being the best version of yourself!
b. I love the real people interviews and inspiring stories because they add depth to the commercial and subsequently the brand. It shows the brand is more than just a water bottle company and it's effective because of that.
I really don't want any changes to be made, I really like the ad I love this one!
It highlights how dumb and wasteful it is to waste plastic when you can just refill one!
I don't want any changes I like how natural it is. It seems like a real person.
I don't really want to see any changes to this one,.",Flux,
304828,Kristen,Brotemarkle,kristenbrote@gmail.com,"b. Reading this over again, I feel like a lot of the changes have been hard. but that doesn't mean they've been easy. For example, I wrote that now you have really have to priotize being active if it's going to happen. Whereas in the past I would know I could go to 4 different yoga classes at a studio nearby, if I want to do yoga now I have to be disciplined myself. While it makes it ""easier"" to do yoga in that I now do it at home, it's harder in that there are always one million other things I could do and I don't have an in person teacher or class holding me accountable to finishing! Also, I love how I've become more outdoorsy. I hike 4-5 times more than I did before. I love doing stuff outdoors as with lockdown it was essential for my MENTAL health. This has carried over to being a very positive habit for my active life. It was a hard transition as lockdown was difficult but the outcome itself is good. Hike
Walk
Jog
Walk - by the river near my house
Kayaking
Biking
I took a trip to the Grand Canyon we did biking and hiking 

As my mindmap noted I am doing much more outdoors than before. In 2020 I feel like outdoors has become my happy place! IT has changed because now I feel like outdoors is a safe, covid free zone (of cousre this is only the case if you are really distancing and wearing a mask with others) but I feel more free and I feel like I have a mental health reset. There's also a lot of options so I feel like I can be adventurous in ways I used to be inside (whether workout related or not). i was going to be in europe this summer before Covid so am generally an adventurous, spontaneous person and there aren't as many outlets for that now (no travel, no social life like before etc) but outdoors allows me to go on adventures in the mountains and also can do it with friends in a safer way than say a dinner party. 1. a. Unplugged
b.  Even if I have my phone with me, I rarely check it or check it less when I'm outdoors - on walks or hikes. I work on my computer during the day and feel like my screen time has increased so much during Covid. When I'm outdoors its the oppositve of screentime! Im not checking my emails or the internet but I'm actually breathing fresh air and living in the moment. I feel like even if it's just a 3-4 hour adventure I feel like I'm on vacation. 
c. Last year, I didn't have as much of a need to unplug. I always thought it'd be nice to go outside to unwind and be off emails but maybe felt the need once a month to plan that out. Now I no joke go outside - for a walk or jog at least - once a day!!! I didn't go outside yesterday for a walk/actiivty and by the end of the day I felt really low, and I realized it'd because I usually have outdoor time. being inside so much with work from home and lockdown makes me desire outdoor/less screen time more.

2. a. Adventure
b. As I said, I love to travel and feel like I'm exploring something new. Going on hikes, to new places with old or new friends, I feel like I'm satiating my desire to travel and adventure, just at or close to home! 
c. Last year ... I would have said the outdoors is nice and I appreciate it but I don't think I would have associated it as much as a ""getaway"". I would have thought of travel or seeing a new city/country as being super adventurous, whereas now I think of it more as what I can do locally outside. a.  Where are you? Who are you with? What are you doing? 

I am thinking of the last time I went totally screenfree outside. I was visiting my sister in Hood River (a beautiful town near portland with great hikes and views). We ended up stopping to go on a hike turned local walk and I left my phone in her glove compartment on purpose. Of course, it was good to know she had her phone so if we got lost she could map us, etc. It was only for 1-2 hours but I honestly felt so present and free. It was just me and my sister, in Oregon. 

b. How do you feel before, during and after? 

Before, I had actually been feeling kinda low energy and stressed. It was a sunday and I like to use those to relax but I had driven to visit my sister and we had run errands, hung out with her roommates, gone out to lunch - it just felt like we were on a schedule and doing a lot so I wasn't able to be fully present. Once my phone was in my car and we were on our hike, may I felt so present and so grateful -  I almost felt giddy at first. I finally felt free! Just to breathe the air and look at views. Whlie sometimes it's nice to have a phone to take pictures I've more and more during Covid not even bothered about photos because it's more important to me to be unplugged and not reachable/off my screen too. after I felt refreshed and we had gotten a good sweat too whcih I liked. 

c. The moment gave me freedom - permission to breathe, to be in the moment, and to be grateful. ""So much of my life is hustling - personal growth, growth in working, even meeting fitness goals- that being in nature without my phone felt like I had finally arrived.

d. It's great to escape into nature - now more than ever - because it almost feels like you can escape time and space as we know it, especially since it's been a somewhat stressful year at home.  Even if just a couple of hours it's giving me that freedom and a break.

e. this is a stock photo/not me - but a girl at the end of a hike feeling happiness and relief. The real happiness for me comes from the ability and excuse to be 100% present. 

        What did this activity / moment give you? 

        Anything else you want to tell us?

        Feel free to upload photos to help bring this story to life. I'd say I usually get inspiration from 1) friends and 2) social media like instagram. I usually see friends on Facebook or people I know who tell me (if I'm connecting w/ someone in person or on the phone) they have been doing xys (hiking, kayaking, etc.) and it motivateds me to get outside. I'd say poeple sharing beautiful photos on Instagram of their hikes and views is one big thing that inspires me, or reminds me how much I want to have an adventure and it feels good to be outside. I also like the store REI though I haven't been for awhile, when ever I'm there I always feel like I want to be more outdoorsy than i am! My sister is more active in outdoor sports than I am and she definitely inspires me. 1. Osprey backpacks
2. I recently got a backpack this year and chose Osprey. I like that they had so many options so I could customize it to my own life (namely size, zippers/pockets, etc.) but I also knew a lot of  poeple who had an Osprey backpack and liked it so I felt like it was a legit hiking choice.

I like that there are women's style Osprey backpacks that are more fitted for my frame and I think they are pretty in size and color offerings. It feels very practical, both when looking at it and reading about the features, I feel like I'm not sacrificing the real nuts and bolts of a good hiking pack even though I want to choose something smaller or more lightweight. 

4. I did buy an osprey pack this year but it's mainly after seeing my friends have them and looking at options on REI. I did not go to social media or share on social about this. I think if they showed how hydro flask was there for you in a hard year to make sure you are hydrated and prepared for whatever adventure or vacation you want to go on, even a vacation right in your backyard. That sounds corny I guess but I think there are many people like myself who are having a hard time with Covid but associate getting outside with a sense of clarity, freedom, normalcy, fun, and adventure. I Think if hydroflask was associated with these feelings as a being a reliable companion to make the most of your journeys outside/out of the home, that could be a good message. 
I think it would be great if they acknowleged its been a challenging time to stay inside all day, I think honoring people's struggles to validate the range of experiences people are having may create a more meaningful connection to the brand. Having something only ""yipee get outdoors!"" may be tone deaf to why people are moving outside more - that's often the only place we can be social or explore fully. 
I'd tell them to definitely acknowledge this struggle and show how they are a companion in the adventures we still can go on outside. What is your first impression? What does this say to you?

It says - here is an organization that is helping kids connect with the outdoors in creative ways. It makes it look like - or tells us- that these kids would not have this opportunity to do this otherwise. It gives the benefit of adventure that so many of us love - that is essential for self-confidence, mental health, physical health - to kids who likely really need it. At the end it does show how much Hydroflask gives to make this happen, which I like because it doesn't mention hydroflask every 2 seconds. It makes it look like they really care about the kids and the outdoors and this isn't just a chance to say hydroflask 40 times in a video. 

What do you like or dislike about it? Why?

I like that it has some great nature shots and shows the humanity of the kids. My biggest dislike/drawback is that it is too long. I'd never watch this on my own. Like if it was shared on social media or I was on the website - it would need to be 2 minutes or less. I do feel like there are points where it is just music and showing kids laughing or outside that could be cut. My favorite part is when the kids talked and gave a takeaway. I think this could be condensed into a 2 minute video and keeping all of the great feedback the kids shared indivually - like ""when I'm outside I can step back and take a breath"" and ""you can show who you really are""

What changes could be made for you to take notice in a really positive way?

As I said above, I'd 100% keep the ""takeaway"" or positive feedback monologue moments and maybe add in 1-2 more. Then I'd make the rest condensed, you really only need to see 5 seconds on the bus and 10 seconds of climbing shots. I think people are smart and get the point, but won't feel as enticed to watch a 5 minute video. I'd make it 2 or 3 minutes max, and maybe even start with one of the kids monolgues so it really feels strong in the beginning. a. Right away I love this! This so clearly shows how a water bottle is such a simple solution to our country's obsession with plastic water bottles. I like the play on words with endless refills and endless landfills. I feel like it addresses a real issue (single-use plastics) with a real and accessible solution. If we all had our water bottles with us more often, we wouldn't need plastic water bottles ever. So it expands the water bottle from being an adventure or work companion to being something you have all throughout your daily life.
b. I really like this ad, the graphics, its simple and cathcy. I think In the caption  is good but maybe more could be said, would be my own tip. a. I guess, for me it's a little weird at first because Monday is not a day that I am usually outside as much. Maybe this is intentional? Is it trying to take the ""case of the Mondays"" and turn it into something positive? For me, I don't usually have Mondays off so work during the day and just don't relate as much with sharing my Monday adventures.
b. I like the video itself and the idea of a campaign of sharing joyful moments. But the Monday part feels a little awkward since not a lot of people take afternoons off on Mondays for hikes or adventures etc - or at least people I now.
c. I think if it wasn't set to this day of the week I'd see it more objectively as being a cool campaign and thing to share.",Flux,
396606,Claire,Anderson,knoxville.grrl@gmail.com,"I like these changes because they are activities that help to calm my anxiety and clear my mind. I especially like taking more walks outside because it helps me to enjoy nature and the weather more. Walk at the park, occasionally yoga outdoors

In 2020 I have begun to appreciate the outdoors more because I have been having to spend a lot of time indoors. It was also one of the few places I could go whenever everything was closed down in the beginning of the year. It has become an escape for me and really helps me to feel less anxious about everything going on in the word, and less claustrophobic. The two things that bring me the most joy when I am taking a walk outdoors is the breeze/fresh air and the peaceful noises. I feel like I have headphones in a lot of the times these days, whether that be listening to podcasts, video calls or lectures. When I am outside it feels so refreshing to not have anything in my ears and to hear the birds and the leaves rustling in the trees. The breeze feels so refreshing and really helps to clear my mind when I have been inside on my computer all day long. If I had written this last year, I don't think I could really think of anything that I appreciated that much about the outdoors. I always enjoyed being outside but often took it for granted. I probably would've just acknowledged it as a place to go sometimes. The last time I took a walk was a few nights ago. My sister and I were feeling tired from doing online school all day, so we decided to get out and take a walk. We went down to the dog park down the street because we don't have a dog, but dogs make us very happy! Beforehand we were both feeling kind of ""bleh"" from being inside all day. While we were walking around the dog park we felt excited and refreshed. There are always so many dogs there in the late afternoon because people are getting off work, so we always have plenty of dogs come up and say hi to us. Afterwards, we were both feeling happier and felt like we could spend the rest of the evening inside without having headaches. I am suffering from a depressive episode right now, and being outside with dogs really helps. I really like to get inspiration from social media to see what everyone else is doing. This then gives me ideas for things I could get out and do to feel better! Currently I am getting a lot of inspiration from TikTok for things to do. I also like to look at Pinterest to get inspiration for all kinds of things. The brand that I am choosing is Patagonia. I chose them because I feel like they are always very open and honest about their values. After seeing this prompt I looked them up on social media to see if they had posted anything about voting or current issues recently on their Facebook page! The picture I chose represents how Patagonia wants to give you gear to be able to do whatever you enjoy with whoever you want to do it with! I think that most brands, in order to stay relevant, really need to be speaking up right now about their values. Maybe they could come out with a limited edition ""Vote 2020"" thermos and donate the funds to an organization dedicated to fighting voter oppression. They could also raise money for environmental organizations since they are a brand that revolves around outdoor activities. I think it is a cute idea! I like that it is informative and shows things that hydroflask is doing. However, as a consumer I would probably not take the time to watch this video simply because it is kind of long. Maybe if it was shorter or split into multiple, shorter videos. I like that they are using this ad to promote saving the environment, I think it is a good look for them. I don't think any changes need to be made, I like that it is animated and I think that it will catch peoples' eyes. I think it is cute, and I like that it promotes happiness in a turbulent time. Maybe if there was a hydroflask in the actual video? I feel like I would never know what brand the ad is for if it did not flash the logo at the end.",Flux,
396607,Kathleen,Bedrick,kat98311@gmail.com,"The changes are not necessarily new they are new in a different way. The change with my mom are more manageable at times because she is still very independent. She still works. She's just not very technologically savvy. 

The changes with my spouse's mother are more challenging. It's harder at times to balance those needs and meeting my mother-in-laws wants all the time. Adult child and parent relationships are complicated. The financial aspects of caring for an elderly parent are even more complicated. It's not always pleasant. Things I do in the outdoors : spend time with my dog/ walk my dog, socialize with friends, exercise

My attitude has changed towards the outdoors in general in 2020 because of Covid. In the past, I didn't really think of spending so much time outdoors to socialize with friends. But now it's as though the outdoors is the first place everyone thinks of because it's been drilled into our minds...Covid-19 = enclosed spaces with others is bad = only outdoor spaces a.) The thing that brings me the most joy when I am active outdoors is spending time with my dog outside. I have a hairless dog who absolutely loves going on walks. Minus rain and snow, he doesn't like any type of water. 

The second thing that brings me joy is spending time with friends outdoors. 

b.) It's important to me because my dog is important to me. His health is a priority to me and part of his health is going on walks and getting exercise.  I enjoy seeing him have such a great time on his walks, he's nearly 13 years old. So I take great effort and care in his appearance, care and health. 

Spending time with friends is important because I think they contribute to what makes my life happy and full. They also are meaningful to me and it's important to maintain personal connection with them. I enjoy being able to spend time with friends and connect with them, share our lives together. 

c.) If it were last year, I would have only wrote about my dog last year in terms of what brought me joy outdoors. I didn't spend time with friends outdoors very much last year. The last time I spent time with friends outdoors was 3 weeks ago. I was with my spouse and 4 others friends. Two of the friends are actually my spouse's twin and his fiance - so they are actually family. We had hung out at a park about 5 minutes from where I live. We all brought a few things to eat and some adult beverages. Also we brought some outdoor games to play as well. There was no particular reason for the occasion other than just to spend time together. 

I was looking forward to spending time with friends. I wanted to make sure I didn't forget anything though. It's sort of like how you plan when going to the beach, you pack food, drinks, a blanket, etc. But in variation, you pack antibacterial items and cleaning items too. During the occasion it was great to spend time with everyone and at times, I didn't think about the fact that we were outside. Whenever I spend time with friends outdoors, it does always feel like it doesn't last as long as it would had we been hanging out indoors. For various reasons like there is no bathroom and the weather. After when I was packing up and saying my goodbyes, I was thinking about how it may get harder to do outdoor get togethers as the weather gets colder. 

The opportunity to spend time with family and friends brought happiness. It also brought some sense of normalcy. The feeling of normalcy in terms of being able to socialize with those that are meaningful to me. 

I do spend time with my friends inside as well, not frequently but it does occur. But we try to organize our gatherings outdoors when there are larger groups of us. I look to social media for inspiration as to new local dog parks to take my dog. Oddly enough I'm not that interested in looking up things for myself when it comes to excercising outdoors, it's just a task for me. Get it done and over with and move on with my day type of thing. As far as new places to spend time with friends and family in outdoor spaces, I look to social media, other people, the news and google for inspiration. My friends are a lot easier to think of places to go and things to do when in the outdoors. My mom is a lot more difficult when it comes to the outdoors - she's older so treking through some park, or uneven ground isn't ideal. Plus she's never been an outdoors kinda lady, except for doing some gardening that's about it. a.) Yeti
b) I choose Yeti for its quality. It gets its top marks for credibility for the quality of insulated products. 
c) https://www.brittonmdg.com/blog/the-secrets-to-yetis-success/
d.) No The team at Hydro Flask could take the essence of the brand and make it meaningful and relevant to people by also appealing to those that use their products but aren't necessarily the extreme outdoors types. Or even use their products because they find their products to be of quality. Having several different bottles in different colors and variations only goes so far. Sort of like Nalgene, it fizzles out after a while.

It may be credible given the current context if Hydro Flask were to consider how their products were helpful. So maybe something like a insulted pouch, smaller than the tote that is currently on the website. Or possibly a large tote people are gathering with friends and family in outdoor spaces. A product to use for grocery shopping, but maybe at a lower price point. Products that would insulte when you are taking items for social gatherings i.e. cold dishes, warm dishes. I saw pets in the pictures of people enjoying the outdoors on the website. It seemed odd there are no pet related products. Travel pet water bottles, snack/kibble jars or food flasks. Baby/infant items for food and drink, keeping bottles warm, breast milk cold. 

The advice I'd give is considering everyone, and all the actual functionality and usefulness that their products could actually serve. There's a whole lot that could be created. a.) My first impression is that Hydroflask joined with Northface and other organizations to help inner city children experience the outdoors. It says to me that it's momentary.
b.) I like that it gives kids different experiences. Experiences of how to enjoy the outdoors in different ways. What I dislike is that it seems like the children of that school may not have the opportunity to experience things like that long term. It seemed like it was a one time thing. 
c.) Some changes would be that this is an ongoing program. Not one which is just situational. It would be more positive for me if it was a long term relationship/commitment. I'd like to see that the children's hopes were not just brought up for one day, but rather it was something they can look forward to, learn and grow from ongoing. a.) I like the endorsement to use reuseable water bottles and stop using plastic water bottles. I dislike that it only shows the bottom half of the bottle being plastic. I also think the endless landfills combined with just half a plastic water bottle needs to be more clear.
b.) I'd think if the whole bottle changed from an entire plastic bottle to a Hydroflask bottle, the morphing imagery, would draw the eye more and be more interesting. Or perhaps incorporate some type of green lush trees with life using reuseable waterbottles and then landfills with plastic waterbottles. a.)My first impression of it is could be any type of emotional type positivity. It says to me moments of happiness can be shared with HydroFlask and they will feature it on their on social media page.
b.) I like the encouragement to celebrate life's moment's of joy. I dislike the reinforcement that everything in life has be shared on social media.
c.) Perhaps if it was a close up view, or multiple views. A view from what it looks like from the child's view, the dog's view, something to give it a bit more of an interesting appeal.",Flux,
198777,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"Definitely not thrilled about the stress loops and wearing new grooves into my floor, wondering every day what sort of new calamity is going to befall us, but something about moving feels like I'm making a positive contribution to my well-being. Stagnation = death

As far as the exercise apps go, I used my 8Fit app before but it always took a backseat to gym work. Now that I haven't been able to go to a gym in seven months, 8Fit and Nike are pretty much my go-to exercise solutions. All in all, I'm pretty happy about them, but I do miss lifting weights. 

I don't actually miss seeing people at the gym or the incessant news playing above the equipment, but I like that the gym was a place where I could entirely focus on what I was there to do. Working out via an app now means stealing some time from my day in a part of the house that was not meant for working out. I run outside, on both streets and trails (when I can).

I walk my dog outside. I've found walking my dog inside doesn't really do it for her. :-)

The outdoors is really important to me. Used to be that I would never run on the roads, but in the early part of the pandemic, the trails were shut down because they were overcrowded, which was a huge bummer. I felt like those of us who used the trails regularly before most of the world shut down should have received some sort of special dispensation to keep doing what we were doing. 

Later on (in the last couple of months), terrible fires have raged across all of California, where I live, so trails have been shut down either because they've been destroyed by fire, or because the air in general was so bad that it was unhealthy to be outside exerting yourself. 

Lately it's a little better, but it certainly has made me appreciate my easy access to the outdoors in the best of times, and how fragile our outdoor ecosystem is in the worst of times. A. I love to be somewhere most people are not. If I'm deep on a forest trail early in the morning, the rest of the world falls away, especially if I can't hear/see the encroachment of a nearby city. 
B. There are few places where you can really feel alone, to have time with your thoughts and not feel pressure to do anything but what you're doing in the moment.
C. Very similar, but now, I feel like being able to access this feeling of solitude, of getting away from a world that can feel so heavy these days, is even more important than it used to be. A. In this pic (I'm third from right), I'm on top of Mt. Lukens -- a local peak that we arrived at after running 6 miles uphill -- with the Trail/Ultra team, a group of athletes I was coaching for various trail and Ultramarathon events we were scheduled to do in early summer. This was taken in March at our last practice before everything shut down. 
B. It was a great day with our small but dedicated group of ultra-runners. The weather was amazing and the climb up was very forgiving by the standards of hardy trail runners. Blazing back downhill for those last six miles, I don't think it ever occurred to me that we wouldn't run again together as a group but I felt very accomplished by the end of the run.
C. Even though the greater Los Angeles basin was always pretty visible, the higher up you go, the less noise you hear, and of course everything gradually becomes smaller and smaller when you're 5000 feet above everyone else. Still, we enjoyed a pretty solitary day (among our small group) and quiet. People who run trails aren't afraid of being alone with their thoughts for a long time. 
D. Re: that second photo -- for some reason, there was a metal folding chair at the top of the mountain, so naturally, we had to take turns sitting in it and taking pictures. I collect my outdoor inspiration from all sorts of sources -- Magazines: Outside, Runner's World, Trail Runner; I also belong to several running and trail-running focused Facebook groups and I have an Instagram handle solely dedicated to my exercise and trail running exploits (where I only follow people in that space as well.) Walking around the outdoor store REI is a great source of inspiration as well. A. I may have mentioned them before, but I have to re-up on my support of Patagonia. 
B. Not only do they hinge their brand identity on sustainability and eco-conscious manufacturing, they've been out front on social justice issues and vocal about their support for civic responsibility (e.g. their ""Vote The A--holes Out!"" tags on their clothes.)
C. I'll follow below with a link to Patagonia's ""Worn Wear"" initiative that encourages people to share, recycle or repair their Patagonia clothes if they get ripped or torn. They even hold events where people can bring in their Patagonia clothes to get fixed. It's hard to imagine another high-end clothing/lifestyle brand really putting their money where their mouth is in that way, and from my perspective, it's an amazing way to build brand loyalty. https://wornwear.patagonia.com
D. I've talked about this particular Patagonia endeavor with one of my outdoorsy friends. I do have a couple of Patagonia pieces from a while back, but it certainly encourages me to spend more money with them because it feels like their investment in my satisfaction is unrivaled. The essence of the brand seems to be supporting people to go on any adventure. I see their ""Climb Higher"" video series and that's really an excellent way to elevate the brand as being something more than just a product. Hydro Flask specifically touches on this in the video, but one of the issues that has arisen in the past seven months is that the outdoors is not equally safe for everyone. Addressing this issue head on as an outdoor brand automatically puts them at the center of the public discourse, and their ""Climb Higher"" videos (front and center on their website) give them immediately credibility, in my opinion. 

My advice to Hydro Flask would be to continue addressing these types of social issues through all their various channels. It's paramount to keep a dialogue going with their customers and other brands who might need a nudge to understand the value of progressive thought leadership. a. Well, I guess I got ahead of myself! I love this video -- love everything about it. To me it's a statement by the brand that they are definitely taking note of the inequalities around people of color having equal and safe access to the outdoors. 
b. I really like that any branding is very modest -- none of the kids are chugging Hydro Flasks (that I noticed). 
c. I had never seen the video before I watched it this evening, but I certainly would have liked it to get wider exposure (beyond outdoor lifestyle circles) perhaps. So... ideally this video is spread more widely by influencers. a. It's great! I love it! I think single-use plastics are a scourge on the environment but this flips the idea of ""just another product to consume"" into something that's addressing a real problem.
b. The message is good and I don't really have any suggestions as to different messaging, but if there was some sort of CTA to a sweepstakes giveaway for a Hydro Flask, that would definitely persuade me to engage more with the brand. a. I'm always here for high-quality dog content. It doesn't say too much, though, other than being a very quick hit of good vibes.
b. I like it because it's light and feel-good content but the graphic bumpers seem to be longer than the actual content. Feels like the content is barely there. (EDIT: I went to go look at the actual post on Instagram and it's better.)
c. I wouldn't be mad at a funnier caption or some sort of caption contest connected to the video.",Flux,
325502,Dennis,Grant,grantden@gmail.com,"The changes that I circled I feel are for my benefit. With the state of emergency that we are in, I felt it was imperative that I became more knowledgeable about the food I take into my body in order to combat any infection or sickness. I have always been pretty healthy but I am way more conscious about it now. I also began reading the Thesaurus in order to keep my mental health strong and sharp. Since the lockdowns in March, I stepped my output of the music/creative endeavors that I was pursuing even more know and have definitely make noticeable progress. Outdoors Activites: Play Basketball (solo), run and quality time with son. 

I have been way more appreciative about going out and getting fresh air than last year by far. I still don’t go out much but when I do, I enjoy the environment and really take it all in. My son and I walk about a mile to the museum once a week if the weather is nice and we discuss life, nature, etc. The change is largely because of the lockdown in Chicago during the spring where we really weren’t advised to be out at all at one point. A. The two things that bring the most joy to me when I am outside is the natural beauty of my environment and the people that are also outside. The environment is important to me because it’s a reminder that there is life all around me and that I am part of bigger, natural system as well. The people are important because it is a brief peek into what they are experiencing as well in the same environment. We may be doing totally different things but for that moment, strangers are sharing the same physical space as well as contributing to that same space. If this was written last year, my appreciation would not have been as high as this year. Also I probably would have written something a bit more topical like going to an event or what not. I went out to the museum by myself about a week ago. I walked from my place because it was nice out and I wanted to get some fresh air. I actually felt excited about the chance to get out and be amongst the outdoors. The time outside was stress free, I listened to some of my latest music during my walk and just took in the sights. When I am looking for inspiration to be in the outdoors, I have utilized Pinterest as a starting point. I have made mood boards before that incorporated elements of what my outdoors experience would look like, especially if I am traveling. For example, I made a mood board for a trip to Portland that I was planning that incorporated cabins, hiking trails and things I could do on bicycle while there. I’ve also watched tv shows to get inspiration. Anthony Bourdain, No Reservations, is one I come back to regularly because even though it’s basis is on food, he also goes to a variety of places and I use that exposure he provides to take mental note of places I would like to visit. I will definitely have to mention Patagonia because I appreciate their commitment to the support they provide to help improve the environment and protect the land against harmful people and/or initiatives. I have been a consumer of theirs for about 6 Years now and even the way they take care of their customers through the products they offer is exceptional. I’ve never had a problem getting worn items fixed and the quality of the products is very good. I did look further into the senate race between Mark Kelly and Martha McSally prior to seeing it on the Patagonia site because I have family in Arizona so we discuss the political environment there. However, I did share this link with them when I saw it so they could glean over it and give me some of their personal insights as well. The most important thing for me is visual representation of people of color in the advertising. That is imperative that we include that in the visual representation of the brand. Secondly, Hyrdro Flask should align with a social justice cause as well in order to establish a sense of purpose within the brand. There are many social groups to choose from so the ones that share the same values as Hydro Flask should be the ones that take priority. Awesome! This is everything that I would want a brand to acknowledge. We have diversity in the video and a wonderful message. Showing young people of color is exceptionally wonderful because it provides a basis of relatability for other young people who will see this video. The only recommendation I have is to get this out to as many eyeballs as possible. I like this because it translates the idea very directly. This to me shows that when you are using Hyrdo Flask, you are helping the environment by reducing pollution. The graphic/animation is clean and non-convoluted. I mean it’s definitely a light hearted display but this would not get my attention. I feel like I’ve seen this before so it wouldn’t be impactful enough to me to take note, especially in the clutter of social media. My changes would including someone of color because there is a lack of that in outdoors brand. It’s like black people don’t do any outdoors activities. Starting there would be good and still keeping it light hearted.",Flux,
396604,Christina,Dominguez,dominguezmchristina@gmail.com,"2020 has been a difficult year to be as active as I’d like but nonetheless I’ve made it work. I am confident that these changes will make do for now but I am look forward to a new sense of normalcy, soon enough. Well, currently I’ve been exercising outdoors in places like my backyard...and front yard. I have taken walks around my neighborhood as well. Sadly, hiking trails are closed yet again so I’m unable to explore my local trails which is something I like to do. Hiking and yoga (outdoors) are my favorite! So hiking is a challenge for me as I try to try new (challenging) trails. I enjoy the release of endorphins and I absolutely LOVE being able to get grounded to Earth during the process. For example, there’s a trail I really like that has a nice waterfall near it. After my hike, I would take off my shoes and go barefoot in the dry soil and walk into the nice cool water. Outdoor yoga is a new sense of normalcy at the moment and it reminds me of hiking but there’s no waterfall, of course. Instead, I feel rejuvenated and grounded. I would do yoga last year but I would be able to take classes at yoga studios, the gym, and even with friends! I just completed an outdoor yoga session yesterday via Zoom. I was joined by two of my close friends and we definitely had some technical difficulties (and challenges) as a result. For example, it was quite annoying looking back at a tiny phone screen (that’s how I was connected to Zoom, outdoors), the connection was spotty in the area I was in outdoors, and it just wasn’t the same, simply put. It’s great to be alone and enjoy nature alone but I’ve done that for the majority of 2020 now so in a sense I just missed being able to be doing yoga in person with my closest friends. So I am very imaginative and I try to come up with new things on my own. However, Pinterest and Instagram definitely help me get inspired at times. For example, I was inspired by a post on Instagram to decorate my new “yoga space”’outdoors a certain way. Nike is a top retail brand and I’ve found their posts on social media to constantly be inspiring. For example, they post about the pandemic and current world events. To me, it’s great when a company with such power addresses things in a way that can totally set the tone for its fans. Before I begin can I say I own SO many HydroFlask bottles?! My kids too! We love the bottles you have created and they are of such great quality.

Now back to the question, I think HydroFlask can increase their social media presence to allow more opportunity for “fans” to engage with their content. Sponsored Posts/Ads are one way but I feel a more organic approach would be best. Maybe create a new hashtag? First impression: Woah, I like this.

Why? Well, first off I like how it addresses something and that’s being more active outdoors. Continuing to rise, even if you fall. The first shot of the boy climbing up and not giving up totally reminded me of many of us in the pandemic. I’m sure it isn’t intentional but I was able to resonate with that and I feel pathos definitely makes an impact when it comes to videos.

As far improvement goes, I’d say it needs to be seen more! Some sort of hashtag movement at the end would allow this video to be shared and/or discussed on sites such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Oh man. This is incredibly awesome. The image and those hashtags are amazing. Seriously. I know I already own HydroFlask bottles but this image makes me want to purchase more andddddd some to gift to family and friends. This image shows how great the brand is! Yes! Here we go! The hashtag! I love it. This is exactly what I was going for when I mentioned it in the first portion of this assignment.",Flux,
396605,Jayne,Chen,jaynealaiachen@gmail.com,"Change is always a blessing and a curse. Change creates growth, realization, strength, insightfulness, etc. Depending on what kind of person you are, change is ultimately for the best. I am the type of person who will take anything- positive or negative and turn it into a blessing. And this is done out of a necessity to adapt, and to become the best version of myself possible. I exercise, move my body and see new things in the outdoors. I used to enjoy exercising only in a gym and only went running on treadmills. I biked only when it was necessary and even when traveling, preferred indoor museums to exploring nature outside. When COVID forced us all to quarantine and gyms and all my usual indoor venues to shut down, I had to improvise and figure out how I was going to do things like Zumba, running, weight lifting outdoors. Even traveling, both for work and for pleasure would be relegated to outdoor-only attractions. Since lockdown began, I have a newfound appreciation for being outdoors and nice weather. I appreciate being able to take in fresh air, have my personal space, and feel as though it is really just my ""me"" time. I love outdoor dining in New York City and have been a huge fan of the ""open streets"" program and concept. I have been actively taking advantage of these car-free streets and bike all the time. 1a. Zumba in the park. 
1b. It is important to me because I love to dance, but only in spaces where I feel open to be myself and dance without judgement. I love my local Zumba class because both the instructors and all the other participants make me feel so comfortable to be dancing in the park. Participants of all ages, sizes, genders, ethnicities, come together to enjoy our neighborhood park and get a great start to the day with some fun dance time. 

2a. Biking & picnics along the Hudson River Greenway 
2b. I love biking and ending the route with a picnic along the water. It is one of my favorite ways to spend a weekend. I love the exhilaration of biking and the adrenaline, coupled with winding down and enjoying a nice meal with a scenic view. 

c. I would have never written 1 last year and I would have been way too busy to say that I did 2 more than once every few months. I was never comfortable enough to do Zumba outside of the safety of the four walls of my gym, but COVID made me realize there are bigger issues in the world then worrying about what strangers think of you. Prior to COVID, I was working two jobs that ate up 70 hours out of my work, and basically all the hours available in a weekend. I would have never written about 2 last year because I just would have never prioritized it or had time to do this. a. I am biking the Hudson River Greenway, starting all the way downtown at the Staten Island Ferry terminal and going all the way up to 165th street. I am with my partner and we are both on bikes. 
b. The exhilaration of biking the Hudson River Greenway sounds simple, but it is an incomparable feeling. My body loves that I am moving around, giving it the exercise it needs to continue running day to day. I love feeling like I am exercising and keeping up with my health. During the ride I am taking in the whoosh of the wind and the crisp air as it whips through my hair. I am looking out at the water just to my left as my partner and I bike side to side. I am thinking about how smooth the bike trail is, and how much I love being able to do this with my partner. After the ride is over, when we are sitting on a picnic blanket by the water, sandwiches in hand and bikes plopped down on the grass next to us, I think about how much fun I had and how I cannot wait to do it again. 
c. I correlate this bike ride/picnic with getting to spend time making memories with my significant other, feeling a sense of pride and happiness that I am doing the right thing for my body and being active with the time I have, and again pride in that I am FINALLY taking care of myself and making sure that I am getting up, getting out, and enjoying my life.
d. You heard it all already! I find inspiration everywhere. Obviously social media is a huge part of my life, and so a lot of my inspiration comes from places like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, etc. I also source inspiration from friends, colleagues, relatives. I also look up mood boards a lot via Pinterest, influencers, Tumblr, local NYC news sources like Gothamist, AMNew York, etc. a. Patagonia
b. I did not use to like Patagonia. Patagonia has a reputation for being elitist, and exclusive to non-people of color. But recently, I saw that Patagonia made waves on social media and in the headlines for taking an active stance on some of the unrest in our society and some of the larger societal issues at large. In a new clothing launch, tags were sewn in that read ""Vote the Assholes Out."" Although I can't say that this has created extreme brand loyalty for me (there is much more they can do), I do have to give Patagonia props for taking a stance and for taking action. A lot of brands haven't even been able to do that bare minimum yet and for this, I have to give Patagonia major props.
c. https://www.vogue.com/article/patagonia-vote-tags-political-statement
d. Of course I shared this with friends. I told them how Patagonia is starting to take steps in the right direction and how it just might make me take a trip out to the Union Square store. I shared the news story on social media, which I don't do unless I really feel like it is not performative. I also liked all the ""hype tweets"" around it because I do think Patagonia deserves the recognition and praise it received for this. I am passionate about brands that are passionate. I believe that resources, such as access to outdoor activities, and gear like HydroFlask and clothing like Patagonia, should be equally accessible to ALL. I believe in brands that champion equity- whether that is through creating campaigns specifically highlighting people of color, creating products priced fairly and in a non-exclusive way, creating pop up events in neighborhoods of color and lower-income neighborhoods. I work in Equity & Community Engagement and think about this for a living, but personally also really believe in the concept of meeting people where they are at. Show up for people of color by creating engaging, on the ground events introducing those who are unfamiliar with HydroFlask to seeing it as a resource. The last thing you want is for your brand to be associated with words like ""elitist, exclusionary, non-accessible, not for people of color."" 

My other advice is to take a stance. Put out a message about and for the greater good of our society, especially in the climate that we are in today. The brands that I stay away from are brands that haven't said anything, haven't done anything, and are hoping to ""ride out the wave."" For those of us who seek change and experience firsthand some of the major issues that surround our society, we're not going to let this wave die down. We know that the goal is to trend towards a better, more equitable, more equal society and brands and companies that fail to recognize that are willfully ignorant. a. I really love this. I love that it addresses how inaccessible the outdoors can be for children that come from underprivileged, urban settings. I love that Hydro Flask is giving back to the community in a way that make sense for the brand, but puts real people, real individual impacts at the forefront.
b. I love that it brings in the stories of real people, with real lives, like how the majority of us live and grow up. I love the genuine reactions of the kids, and I don't mind the long video because I want to continue to see these kids enjoy this experience.
c. I grew up in an urban, public school, economically disadvantaged setting much like this one here. What I would have loved to see, imagining myself as a viewer all those years ago, is the line ""We know that this is just the beginning. There is so much more to do and there are so many more students we want to share the outdoors with. We promise that this we're just getting started. I know you already highlighted (briefly) that Hydro Flask is working with hundreds of schools, but I think this message would just tie the whole video together and show that this is part of a larger movement to make a real social impact. a. I like the basic concept, I like the simplicity. It sends a very directed message in a simple way. My only concern is that it may be too simple. I might just scroll past this on my feed if I wasn't paying attention because nothing really pops for me. 
b. I would add a very dramatic statistic about landfills or climate change at the very bottom and highlight it to stand out. I think you want to capture the viewer's attention by having something stand out and I think having a statistic about landfills or climate change will take this from a ""good advertisement"" to an advertisement that sticks with you; an advertisement you learn from. a. I like this video; it's cute.
b. I like that this campaign is trying to spread cheer and joy in a time where the world is in disarray and where we really do want to revel in the simple things in life. Maybe that could even be a tagline- ""the simpler side of life.""
c. Highlight a video of the same concept from someone who isn't really famous or popular or paid to be a brand spokesperson. Don't be afraid to repost unverified accounts. Showcase a person of color- we need to see more people of color showcasing joy. Repost videos from regular folks who use your brand and like your brand and are deliberately sharing their #MondayMomentsOfJoy",Flux,
396602,Zack,Schwartz,running_man88@yahoo.com,"Main changes in 2020 were in the areas of physical fitness and hanging out with friends. Instead of going to the gym and fitness studios for workouts, I shifted to running/biking outside (hadn't been on a bike in several years). My bootcamp studio was closed for a while but is now running their classes outside which has been good. I also bought a spin bike for my house for those days when the weather isn't good for exercising outside.

In terms of hanging out with friends, I haven't been doing that as much in person these days. But I have been doing more Zoom hangouts. It's not quite the same but it's a decent substitute for now.

All in all I feel I have done a good job adapting but I am very much looking forward to things going back to normal. '- Running
- Biking
- Outdoor workouts classes
- Yoga/stretching can be inside or outside

I always loved spending time outdoors, so my mindset hasn't changed that much due to the events of this year. However, I am doing more of my exercise outdoors than I did in the past, since my gym and indoor workout studios are closed. Other than rainy days, I definitely appreciate getting outside for some fresh air.' The two things that bring me the most joy are the fresh air and seeing others being active. I think fresh air and sunshine are very important for peoples' health, and it always makes me happy to see my neighbors out enjoying nature as well.

I don't think my answer would have changed vs. last year. These were always elements of being outside that I enjoyed. The last time I went out for some fresh air was going on a bike ride this morning. I ended up doing a 10 mile loop and the weather was perfect (about 65 and cloudy). I was riding by myself, and I went through my own neighborhood as well as some nearby ones. I felt a little sleepy at the beginning but by the end I was feeling strong and energized for the day. I tend to always work out in the mornings, alternating between running, biking, and my outdoor bootcamp class. My morning doesn't feel complete without some form of exercise. Attached is a picture of my bike! I find inspiration in many different places. Some of those include:
- Friends and family that enjoy participating in sports and outdoor activities
- I subscribe to Outside and Backpacker magazine, which have great articles about the outdoors
- Podcasts related to the outdoors including ""Athletes Unfiltered"" by Strava, ""Endurance Planet"" and ""The Endurance Podcast""
- I am part of a local running group called San Diego Track Club
- Following some well known runners, cyclists, and other athletes on Instagram

When I look for inspiration, I look for information on the lifestyles of athletes I admire, as well as general information about sports. What brand did you choose? 
Nike

Why did you choose it? What gets it top marks for credibility? 
I chose Nike for their ""Just Don't Do It"" campaign that came out shortly after the murder of George Floyd. I thought this was a great message to put out during the pandemic condemning racism. There was no promotional aspect to it at all.

Please share a link or photo of the brand - if you could highlight what caught your eye that would be great! 
Attaching photo.

Did this prompt you to do anything after seeing this? For example; share this with a friend, look into buying something from the brand, look them up on social media, nothing at all? 
I had a few conversations with friends about this commercial and we all agreed that it was a good move by Nike. I was just looking at the Hydroflask website and I appreciated the fact that it talked about donating $1 from every sale toward Sustainable Northwest, a group promoting forest health. I think Hydroflask should also emphasize outdoor activities as a good way to stay active/enjoy yourself while still staying socially distant. I would also like to see the brand taking a stand on racial issues and doing something to encourage minorities and underrepresented communities to enjoy the outdoors. I like this video because it highlights an important program that helps disadvantaged kids get outdoors, and Hydroflask is one of the program sponsors. I also like that it's not overly branded by Hydroflask - I think the brand was only mentioned once or twice. This video is not trying to sell anything.

If I were to make any changes, I'd make the video a bit shorter. Maybe closer to 2-3 minutes vs. 5. But other than that there is nothing I disliked. I really like this concept, because it clearly illustrates why a metal reusable bottle is so much better for the environment vs. buying single use plastic bottles and throwing them away. It's a simple and powerful message and a clear selling point for Hydroflask. I don't dislike anything about this idea. I think this concept is okay, as it emphasizes happy moments during the day. However, I don't think there is necessarily a clear message here or a real connection to Hydroflask as a brand. I don't see any water bottles in the short video.",Flux,
381560,Tom,Pastre,tpastre@optonline.net,"Many of the changes make me feel sad. Most everything I do to live an active lifestyle has changed in some way. The saddest changes involve interacting personally with others. Not seeing family and friends as often. Not physically touching these people. Not being around people when eating out, at concerts, the theater or other events is rather depressing. So is not traveling. I've been able to see some of my grandchildren more often, but it's been to help out with remote learning or to babysit to give parents a break.  I've luckily been able to play sports that I love, but there is far less social interaction before of after matches. I've worked on my house more, doing repairs and maintenance more than usual. This to save money but primarily to keep people out of my house:(  Sleep is a critical part of maintaining an active lifestyle and I've always been lucky to sleep through most nights. Not recently though. I've been tending to wake up at 3am every night which sucks. play tennis and paddle tennis
walks with my wife
work on my house/yard 
some social activities visiting local towns with concerts, farmers' markets, etc.
eat at family and friends and restaurants outside 
play with grandchildren at playgrounds and in the yard

I've always enjoyed the outdoors so my mindset hasn't changed all that much. Not much has actually changed about my outdoor activities except eating outdoors - have done that way more than is typical and it might change as the weather gets colder which will be challenging and potentially depressing. Playing tennis/paddle tennis. It's important because it keeps me physically active and competitive, and is a great mental release. I enjoy that it's outdoors the most (I don't go to and don't like going to a gym). There's a social aspect I enjoy a lot, especially since I belong to a club and have a steady group of friends to play and socialize with.
The only thing different between now and last year is the social aspect - we pretty much play and leave, little mingling afterward, no handshakes, hugs, etc.

Being with my children and grandchildren, who love to be outdoors- nature walks, going to the beach, playgrounds, duck ponds, etc.  It's important because they give meaning to life and make my life fuller. The difference from last year is that we've seen them less often this year, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. And more recently, when we've seen them it's primarily been indoors to help with virtual learning. I played paddle tennis this morning with three of my friends - it's a doubles game. It's played outdoors in a screened-in court. The morning was crisp and clear, a beautiful fall morning to be outside. I felt excited before playing, exhilarated while playing, and refreshingly tired and sweaty afterward. Playing gives me a sense of being alive and a sense of pride in being able to compete at an older age. It's two hours of complete freedom from the world's troubles and fun like you had when you were a kid. If you play poorly and lose it's not as much fun, but you still get to be outside. Like playing a poor round of golf, but who cares because there's nothing like being on a beautiful golf course (I play but haven't in a while and has nothing to do with COVID) As a voracious researcher I look at all of the above for inspiration.  Friends provide some of the best insights and ideas as to what to do outdoors. Of course the internet is a huge source for new ideas. I subscribe to so many things I can't identify one source as being superior to others. The Territory Ahead. It's a fashionable clothing line positioned around iconic American outdoor themes of  the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and the Adirondack mountains. We get the catalogue all the time even though we've never purchased from them. It's one of the few catalogues I go through because I love the men's clothes and photography is great. The colors are fantastic and the styles are rugged outdoor-looking but fashionable. It's kind of cooler looking Eddie Bauer. While they get me to look through the catalogue every time, I never buy anything because I think they're too expensive. They are an outdoor active brand that handles food and beverages so obviously safety and security should be a key attribute to communicate.  People are afraid of getting sick and will be for quite a while. If their products guarantee food freshness/safety they should promote that. Also show families safely doing outdoor activities and avoid showing unsafe outdoor gatherings. I don't know what this has to do with the brand. Nobody even hydrates during the whole thing. Could be for Patagonia or North Face or anybody else. Seems meaningless and that they are just supporting with donations. It's also long and boring to me. This is cool. Very simple representation of a solution to a huge problem. Nicely done. I have no idea how it relates to the brand. They aren't using the product. They should be joyful because of the product (unless I'm missing something)",Flux,
396603,Chelsea,Mendoza,chelseaxhz1988@gmail.com,"I think some changes are major, such as weightlifting and kickboxing. Other things are baby steps, such as park far away from the store and ditch my robot. It's interesting to see how little things can make all the difference as well. I put meditation in there because that's how I keep my mind active. I do believe actively engaging my mind is part of being active. I have to say I decreased the amount of outdoor activities due to covid. I mainly walk around the small park near my house or my neighborhood. Unfortunately, many people don't wear masks in large outdoor areas when it's packed, so I don't feel safe anymore. Last week I went to the big park in my area, and there were several events going on at the same time. A lot of the times people are almost shoulder to shoulder, but not even half of them wore masks. Oh geez, I wish I could return to the good old days when I can fully enjoy being around my family and friends! Walking and wandering without any purpose.

I think they are good ways to de-stress for me. I usually pop on some music if I walk alone, or narrate the whole scene to my little toddler if he joins me. My mind was completely occupied by the beauty of nature or the joy my little one brings me instead of pandemic, work, obligations, and stress. I can take all the time I need to fully allow myself to purge all the negative thoughts and refresh positivity in my life.

Actually it's the same! I've always enjoyed walking without any purpose in my mind. I was walking around the neighborhood with my husband and little one. Finally the weather was nice enough to enjoy, so we decided to take an afternoon walk. Getting a toddler ready is always a mess! But it's also the fun part. My husband and I kept our little one entertained. Whether it's a bird, a tree, or a beautiful house, we made sure to point out almost everything we saw to him. It's a good way for the whole family to bond and slow down a bit. 

I usually don't take any pictures during our walk. I feel it takes away some of the fun. Having a perfect picture feels the moment is staged. I know, I am weird! Even though I used to find a lot of inspirations from social media, currently I pretty much go by what is safe for me and my family. I avoid crowded places at all costs. 

For active lifestyle, I do follow Fitness Blender, Coach Greg, and other infuencers on social media. I purchased multiple programs from Fitness Blender because they really focus on encouraging you to workout and stay active. In terms of outdoors, I pretty much stay within my neighborhood. Also keep in mind, South Texas is not a good place for outdoor activities during summer thanks to brutal heat and humidity. Hands down Patagonia. I think Patagonia is a model for social responsibility and accountability. The brand is very transparent and advocates for environmental conservation and participate in various social causes. Their products are also top notch. I bought an outerwear from them years ago, and it holds up really really well. I wish all companies are like Patagonia. 

I am a loyal customer of Patagonia thanks to their high quality products and social engagement. If I need anything outdoor, it is my number one choice. I just go to their website and pick up what I like to purchase. I have never been disappointed by my purchases before. Be transparent. Whether where the product is sourced and made or how employees are treated, be transparent with consumers. Also, don't make donations as a ""show"" or publicity, do it because you believe in it. I clicked on the banner of Timberline Collection, and this is what I saw -- ""We can't find products matching the selection."" Unfortunately, it doesn't sit right  for me. Thirdly, price your products accordingly. If I'm being honest, I think hydroflask is a bit overpriced. I know the products are good, and it's been highly raved on social media, average consumers, especially during Covid, won't have $40 available for a water bottle. Could there be some programs available to help people in need? Lastly, I want to say too much social media exposure is a turn-off for me. It makes me feel like the brand put too much energy and focus on advertising instead of connecting with real consumers like me. I am not a fitness professional or fitness model, so I don't need that super flashy picture with a gorgeous water bottle with hashtags. My best advice would be take a look at what Patagonia has done and how they do it. They are not all over social media, and yet, there are many loyal consumers like me supporting them all along. I absolutely love this. It's very relatable. Instead of highlighting Hydroflask, the ambitious students are the star of the show. I really like this approach. There is nothing I dislike about this episode. Big Thumbs up! I like that it focuses on sustainability. However, this somehow lacks originality. Almost all the water bottles on the market can use this angle. I wonder if there is something different Hydroflask can bring out. For example, how is the bottle made? What is the material? How is our production process minimize environmental impact and save X amount of plastic/energy/water/whatever resource required. I think that might be what makes hydroflask stand out from its competitors. I like it! It says it's something for everybody! I think it pours a lot of positive energy, and I appreciate it.
Hmm the negative? It's really free advertising for Hydroflask on social media. Many people will post and tag Hydroflask. It doesn't really matter who gets selected, Hydroflask gets publicity. I think to make it better, highlight what's in it for everybody who posts. For example, for every hash tag, Hydroflask will donate $X to XXX charity. It will makes me feel oh yeah, by posting I am actually helping and making a difference.",Flux,
230593,Jacqueline,Travaglia,jacqueline_travaglia@hotmail.com,"1. I usually shop on Ocado as the website automatically remembers and fills my shopping cart. If I still have left overs of an item from the previous week then I cross that item off the list. 2. I go out for dinner most nights and sometimes I will have a meal I really love and then try to replicate that meal, so I add a few extra items to the shopping trolley. Last week was Vietnamese rice paper rolls so I added bean sprouts, ingredients to make hoisin sauce, smoked tofu and rice paper rolls. 3. I live on my own but have constant visitors. There is always an overseas or local guest in my spare room on the weekends. Last week I bought chocolate chip cookies and ready made pizza for my friend Rebecca who was over for the weekend. This week I have bought free range eggs, merlot and salmon for my friend Warren who is staying the weekend. A decade ago I lived with ex boyfriend who was always body building. I used to buy high protein meals and lots of meat for him (even though I am vegetarian). Eggs and chicken breasts were always on the list. So were lots of carbs like pasta, rice and bread. I was also studying at drama school and did not have much money so would never buy organic items- there also weren't many organic items available. Everything was home brand and mainly from Tesco. Meals were big and stodgy but always homemade and unprocessed. I have never liked processed foods. We didn't buy alcohol- we rarely drank it. I am now not money conscious so I buy my food mainly  from Ocado. Online shopping is quicker and easier. I buy mostly organic as I can afford it. I rarely buy meat except for my dogs and cat who eat free range beef mince! I buy vegan food for myself unless I have a friend visiting then I will buy dairy and sometimes fish or meat for them. I also have more time as I now work from home so I can prepare everything from scratch. I try to have a low carb diet and opt for brown rice and wholemeal pastas now as there is a trend to not eat carbs. In ten years time I would love to have my own, thriving edible garden. I would love to buy as little as possible from the supermarkets. Ideally all my fruit, herbs vegetable will be home grown. I woulld love to eat no carbs. I would still buy beef mince for my 2 dogs and cat! 1. Living a happy, healthy life to me means to be stress free, happy and enjoying every day. It took me years to acheive, but I feel I have this in my life in the following ways: Sleep  I don't believe in alarms, bodies need sleep and wake up when they need to! I make sure I rarely have to set an alarm. I work for myself from home and only set afternoon appointments if I need to meet friends or schedule work appointments and only book afternoon flights. The strange effect is I really don't need much sleep. I sleep at average of 6 hours a night, going to bed around midnight or 1am and consistently waking at 8am. In my old 9 to 5 days I needed 8 hours and still felt groggy! I also don't set a bed time, I just start falling asleep and then go to bed- again a far cry from my insomniac 9 to 5 days. Stress I think stress makes you tried, groggy and need more sleep. I only spend time with people I like. If people drain me, I don't make time for them. I also treat little life stresses as daily tasks- taking emotion away from them and just getting on with things. I also try my best not to judge or expect things from people- that removes and amazing amount of stress! If someone cancels plans on me or behaves in a way I don't expect I just accept that is the way they are and has no reflection on me. Food I eat mainly vegan wholefoods and cook everything from scratch. I listen to my body. Sometimes I will indulge in cheese or chocolate but can feel my body doesn't want it. By listening to my body I always feel energetic and healthy. Exercise This keeps me energised and means I need less sleep. The first thing I do every day is exercise. I have a fitness pole installed at home and an open space for working out. I start every day with a zumba workout and some pole dancing. I also have a bike and cycle around my local area and walk my 2 dogs every day. I have an apple watch to make sure I do at least 30 minutes of exercise a day and 10,000 steps. Usually I achieve much more. Do things I like every day I indulge in things I like every day. Whether it is having my hair or nails done, a massage, a hot date, seeing friends for lunch or dinner or just going to a cafe with my dogs. It puts me in a great frame of mind and shakes off any little stresses. 2.  Magic Bullet I bought my Magic Bullet 1 year ago to make smoothies so I could have quick, filling, healthy 'fast food' lunches and snacks. I use my Magic Bullet every day. I have at least one smoothie a day as a snack (banana, rice milk and honey). I also use it to make pasta sauces, soups and dips. It is super quick. For a quick soup, I boil up any vegetables I have then puree it in the Magic Bullet. I also make a lot of hummous with it. My Fridge It sounds like an obvious one, but too many people eat frozen food! My fridge means I can do one online Ocado shop a week and store all my lovely fresh fruit, vegetables and homemade cooking in the fridge. I open the fridge door at least 10 times a day! Tagine I bought my gorgeous tagine in Morocco 11 years ago and use it almosy every day. It is so quick and easy to make stews and delicious tasting vegetables. I just chop up any vegetables, add any spices or stock I feel like then add in some pearl barely or couscous and it cooks up in no time. Staples My three staple products are Dream Rice Milk- no added sugar- 1 litre which I have throughout the day in smoothies and also for breakfast with porridge. Knorr vegetable cubes- vegetable 6 cubes- which I use in all my cooking- soups, curries, stews. Sesame snaps- my staple snack- in packs of 4 x 30 grams Switch to healthy options My three staples are products that I have switched to as a healthier alternative. Rice Milk I changed from Soya Milk to Rice milk because I have read a lot of articles stating that Soy Products can interfere with hormones and even cause cancer in large quantities. I use rice milk in smoothies, with porridge and also sometimes in cooking to make sauces such as pasta sauce creamier. I decided to swith to rice milk as it is a healthier alternative to soy and tastes better. It is recommended by online articles. I chose Dream brand as it is organic. Seasame Snaps I was a chocoholic- eating at least 1 bar a day and sometimes a whole block! I ate vegan chocolate but still don't think it is great for you in large quantities. I switched to sesame bars as they indulge my sugar craving and are not highly processed. This is the only brand I can buy online. Knorr vegetable cubes I used to spend a lot of time making my own stock. This is very time consuming which meant I would cheat and get a quick takeaway instead as I dodn't want to wait an hour for flavours to infuse. Vegetable cubes cut my cooking time significantly. On average it takes 20 minutes for me to make pastas, stews and soups- quicker than getting a takeout. I just choose the cheapest vegetable stock cube online. Other Products Swaps I would love to eat 100% unprocessed foods. I would love to make my own stock in bulk and also sesame snaps as well as grow my own herbs and spices. To date, time has restricted me but I want to focus on making time over the next year to make this change. 1. I look at people who either a. have characteristics that I admire/want to have and believe if I take their advice I will achieve the same outcome b. are an expert in a field I am interested in. My vegan friends have great physiques, skin, nails, hair, teeth, lots of energy and clear minds so I trust their advice on being vegan. Dr Dean Ornish is a leading US cardiologist who has reversed cancer and blood pressure through low fat, low animal product, non processed diets so I trust his advice. Now that I think about it, I am not sure why I trust random online articles about diet- but I have to date! That's why I try to eat unprocessed food and choose rice milk over dairy and soy. 2. I found Dr Dean Ornish when I was a teenager- I was vegetarian due to animal welfare concerns and my choice was met with a lot of criticism so I did a lot of research about health benefits of vegetarian/vegan diest at the library. I have found my modelling/body building friends through acting and modelling jobs. I found the news articles through google. 3. I trust my friends and Expert Doctors on health advice. I don't trust online articles as much. 1.

I don't trust online articles as much. 1. Totally agree. New research, new findings, economic resources and life situation are constantly changing what is healthy for us. For example, my Polish builder has a huge carb and fat diet. He puts butter and lard on all his food and eats stodgy dumplings, slabs of meat and lots of bread. He is very healthy, in shape and toned and I think he needs this diet as he is very physically active. My ex boyfriend was a professional footballer and ate a lot of stodgy carbs- again he burnt it off. For me as a desktop worker I really don't need stodgy food or carbs- I would balloon! I think each person needs to find what works for their bodies and also what makes them happy. 2. I make sure I exercise every day and have done this for the past 20 years.  3. Initially it was due to vanity, I wanted to have a good physique but didn't care if I was healthy or not. I would starve myself and have only diet drinks and food.  4. The hardest thing was to find time to exercise every day. I would keep putting it off for later in the day until it was bedtime and too late to exercise! I overcame that by putting my gym clothes on first thing in the morning. I was not allowed to put on normal clothes or have a shower until I had exercised! Sometimes it meant walking around unwashed in gym clothes for most of the day- until I had enough and needed a shower so would workout!  5.  I found my energy levels really increased, stress levels decreased, I had a more positive outlook on life and I liked the way I looked. I also needed less sleep. 6. I still won't allow myself to shower or wear normal clothes until I exercise- every day, even if it is just a quick 30 minutes. I have also started to exercise in my own home and have a pole installed so there is no excuse. I have failed to be 100% vegan...and continually fail at this. The main issue is eating out at friend's houses and they panic at the idea of cooking vegan so I lax the rules to vegetarian. I also travel a lot and sometimes it is hard enough to get vegetarian food yet alone vegan. I figure as long as I eat vegan most of the time, I am deriving the health benefits. Realistically, if I wanted it enough I can make it work. I think I have found peace in my mind with the balance. 1. I felt scared that I am sick and could have a stroke at any minute. 
 2. Noone- I am embarrassed and want to fix it myself 
 3. Yes- I googled NHS UK, British Heart Foundation and the term 'Reduce Cholesterol naturally which took me to The Pritikin Diet. I also goodled Dr Dean Ornish. I am looking for a check list of what to do to reduce my cholesterol. 
 4. Yes it did. All of them had consistent information about reducing saturated fat (dairy/meat), eating more vegetables, doing more exercise, not smoking. So I want to be vegan. I then went on to look at the health benefits of the vegan diet again. Ginger garlic paste- I ran out of ginger so went to my closest supermarket- Tesco did not have any fresh ginger so I bought the next best thing which was ginger/garlic paste. I made sure there were as few additives as possible. No I wouldn't consider it a normal week- I prefer fresh herbs and spirces. 
 Eat Real Coconut bar/peanut bar- I ran out of sesame bars as snacks. They didn't have any at the local Tesco so I bought these instead. I made sure they were as unprocessed as possible. They are delicious and I will keep ordering them weekly. 
 Dinner out- I ate dinner out at a Tapas restaurant but stuck to my vegan diet :) I ate out at friends' houses 2 nights but again stuck to my vegan diet :)",Falafel,

I think the health awareness is definitely much more now than earlier and also changes in lifestyle such as parenting etc. has led me to become more responsible.  - I can't say for sure how things will change in a decade, but certainly be only more healthy. Perhaps some items which take less cooking time but do not consume much oil and fried foods. Increase my soups and salad intake as well.' 1. Living a happy and healthy life to me not just means eating a balanced diet but also being happy at heart. 
 1. I try to achieve this by eating a healthy breakfast and spending time with family and friends, chatting about things that make me really happy and excited is the core. 
 2. I also try to be relaxed while eating for example taking ample break at lunch time at work and not rushing it. 
 3. I try to make my snacks as healthy as possible such as fruits, nuts etc. Having said that I do treat myself to mini bites/chocolates occasionally but keep it limited. 1. I have switched from white bread to brown bread as it is much healthier for breakfast or sandwiches. 
 
 2. I include yoghurt in my diet more often to compensate for calcium intake. 
 3. Juice and fruits is a regular part of my diet now for snacks etc. 1. The main sources are media, NHS, colleagues, friends and general awareness from internet etc. These are the most readily available sources. 
 2. The health campaigns have promoted the awareness well. It is also important to be self motivated and keep health conscious.  
 3. Yes, I do trust the health tips and guidance. 1. The main sources are media, NHS, colleagues, friends and general awareness from internet etc. These are the most readily available sources. 
 2. The health campaigns have promoted the awareness well. It is also important to be self motivated and keep health conscious.  
 3. Yes, I do trust the health tips and guidance. 1. Yes, I think starting from childhood we develop certain habits which last for the lifetime. These dominate our lifestyle and health a lot and changes during different stages such as during job search etc. when we have less time or while living with family as there are more people to take care and remind us of healthy eating. 
 2. Exercising, gym etc. 3. Fitness and sexy figure. 4. I think finding time and making a routine led me to just make it a habit that I do them regularly. 5. I feel much more positive.  6. I think self motivation is most important to continue and maintain the habit. 1. If I got this letter I would be a bit concerned as while I thought I was fit and healthy, I still had high cholesterol level. I'd feel that I must certainly do something immediately to increase my usual activities and make my diet better than before.  2. I would discuss with my husband, other  family members, colleagues, friends just to get their  views i f they  ever had high cholesterol le vel or received such  letter from their doctor. I'd like to know what they did to get back in control and what are their suggestions to me on what I should do differently.  3. I searched internet to get more info on reasons for high cholesterol and what can be done to get it back in control quickly.  4. I finally used some friends and colleagues advice and some knowledge from internet, NHS websites etc. to increase my walking and try to get some running schedules and improving my diet and eating habits such as having dinner on time etc. 1. I think most stuff I bought is what I planned but some extra stuff includes some frozen stuff such as seekh kebabs, prawn gyoza  etc.  2. One of the reasons is it being school half term, so I want to have some thing I can grill quickly if kids want it and some stuff that we can have on the move if we go out.  3. Yes, I do look at the amount of calories and expiry date always apart from looking at the time it will take to cook etc. 4. Apart from eating healthy, it is my conscious effort to achieve a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.  5. I think this week has been a bit heavy on the eating side than usual.",Falafel,
262657,Nilesh,Patel,nileshp1979@gmail.com,"Hi all, 1- I write a list as a note on my phone as and when I remember I need to purchase something. 2-  I decide to put something in the list when either staple food items like milk are running low and items that are eaten on a regular basis such as fruit and veg.  Items that do not make the list, but do end up in my basket are impulse purchases such as something that I may have seen on offer, or a 'treat/reward' such as a cheeky dessert. 3- When purchasing food I am considering for myself and for my wife, who also has a say - sometimes. 1- my grocery list a decade ago would have been totally different from what it is now, for example it would have not included many fruits, it would of included a lot sweet treats like chocolates, ice creams, crisps and cakes.  Now days, there is hardly any of the sweet treats and there is plenty of fruits.  The change happened about 5 years ago when my father developed cholesterol.  Having done my research I realised I was heading that way if I continued with my food choices, and as a result slowly slowly my eating habits changed - for the better (I hope!) 2- This is a tough one, as the way I see it, if I could think of how my grocery list would change in 10 years time, then I would have made that change now, as with most change in eating choices, the change would of been better for my health.  Unless there is a change in my health which needed me to make a change, I can not think of anything at this moment of time. 1. What does 'living a happy, healthy life' mean to me- 
 (a) Firstly, I *love* food, food makes me happy. I enjoy cooking at home, so home cooked meals definitely ticks the 'trying to be healthy' box.  I like to be in control as to knowing what's gone in my meal, so the best way to do this is by cooking it myself.  If there is something that I've eaten outside and totally love the taste of it, I will try to find a recipe online and try to make it myself. 
 (b) I follow a vegetarian diet, this makes me happy that I am not causing any harm to any animals while eating to survive and to have enjoyment.  Following a veggie diet is not necessarily living a healthy lifestyle, so again, here's where the 'home cooked' meals comes into play. 
 (c) Like most people, I do have some downfalls. I have a sweet tooth - chocolates, cakes, sweets....love it all. This certainly makes me very happy. However, to offset some of the 'damage' done to my health I go the gym to do some cardio and weights exercises. 
 (d) Socialising makes me happy, I enjoy meeting friends for coffee, cake or a meal. After every social meet up I always do feel guilty as usually it's the 'naughty but nice' food items that are eaten....so its back to the gym the next day. 
 (e) Travelling makes me happy as its something to look forward to, and I feel going away is also good for my health.  It helps me unwind and to de-stress top 3 staples- 
 1- kelloggs bran flakes, 500g 
 2- m&s tinned italian tomatoes, 400g 
 3- brown rice, 5kg, TRS brand 
 
 
 Switch- 
 I have switched to bran flakes to increase my fibre intake. 
 I have switched cows milk to soya milk as i read that its easier for the body to digest and better for me 
 I have switched normal bread to wheat free rye bread as i feel less bloated, its easier to digest and keeps me full for longer. 
 Being an indian, i often eat homemade curries with chappatis or more recently rye bread for dinner. I need to switch eating the these as it is full of carbs (and i want to reduce my carb intake in the evenings) to a lower carb option. the pics below are the responses to task 9 of thos project the pics below are the responses to task 9 of thos project 1. I totally agree. There is always improvements that can be made to health and well being. 
 2. Increasing in take of linseeds and chia seeds. 
 (1) being a vegetarian, i read in health magazines that i could be lacking of omega 3 fatty acids. Being aware of how important this is for heart and cholesterol care i started take these in food 
 (2) my biggesr challenge was to remembering to take these. So to overcome this, i started to place chia seeds next to my cereal, as i would add a spoon of it in mt daily bowl of bran flakes. And with linseeds, i started to add a spoon in curries, so i left it next to my spices. It actually adds a nice crunch in curries. Also add in salads, soups and smoothies. 
 (3) not noticed any physical benefits yet, but i still read how good they are and are like a 'superfood'. I guess the real test of knowing if its working or not is about knowing the health of my heart and cholesterol level. 
 (4) its just part of everyday life now as I've been adding linseed and chia seeds in foods for over a year now. Its become part of my daily routine. 
 3. Good example is my collegues, they all want to start the week off to a good start by drinking lots of water, having fruit, bringing in homemade lunches. Then, as the stresses of work builds up by middle of the week...all the healthy food regime goes the drain and they reach out for quick highs like drinking multiply cups of coffee, chocolate and cakes. 1- After reading the letter I felt a bit alarmed as it was telling me that I have high cholesterol. 2- I would immediately tell my wife, as I would feel it is something she would and should know. 3- Firstly I went in to the Heartuk.org.uk website to find more information with what my results mean, what to do to reduce it and if there are any support networks near to where I live or work. 4- The information appears to be very informative and to the point. I like from from the Heartuk.org.uk website a section where they have a 'Ultimate Cholesterol Lowering Plan', which seems to be full of useful healthy eating and healthy living tips. It has colourful charts and easy to follow step by step guide.  I really find useful the 'eatwell guide', which is essentially a plate and broken up in how it should have veg, sugars, diary and carbs. 1. There were a few items that managed to sneak into my shopping basket, mainly the Lindt easter bunnies. After easter they were knocked down a fair amount, so I couldn't resist the temptation.   i'll make one chocolate rabbit last a week but taking only a bit to work per day. 2. The reduced price made me get it and also knowing that Lindt chocolate is one of my favourite chocolates. 3. Nope, I've purchased these before, so I knew whats in it 4. I hoped to get my 'chocolate fix' from it by having a small amount each day. 5. I would not class this as a normal week as these chocolates are around everyday of the year.",Falafel,
262615,Andrew,Risner,a.risner@sky.com,"1. How is purchases planned. 
 I shop in an ad hoc manner , from experience I know what is needed and rarely make a list unless there are things I absolutely need for a specific recipe. Usually there are items in the freezer already such as meat and vegetables so not a need to buy every week.
If we are having people over for dinner ( about once a month ) then the purchasing will obviously change.

2. Whats on or not
This will depend on season, social activities e.g.  are we out for the evening and therefore not eating at home, have we been invited out to eat, are friends staying over or am I working away from home and do we need to cut down on higher calorific food. 
 Also there may be various sale offers on food which means we will stock the freezer up e.g BOGOF 
 
 
 3. Am considering my partner and her fluctuating tastes dependant on season i.e more salads in summer more comfort type food in winter. She always is consulted on what we buy A decade ago there would have been: Far more ready meals e.g. curry and spag bol, It's now just as easy to make once you bother to have all the necessary ingredients and spices. Also more healthy and less additives More sugary cereal for breakfast, now we allow time to make a proper breakfast Less meat and more fish More snacks and sweets and chocolate. More careful about our health In the future: Am looking forward to better quality meat substitutes so there is good meat tasting and textural alternative Maybe investigating different varieties of vegetables Making more of our own food e.g. bread, cheese, Leading a healthy, happy life means keeping life in balance. 
That to me means maintaining a healthy balance between work, family, food, lifestyle and stress. 
 I ensure that I don't bring work back to the house and make sure that time spent at home is quality time, this also  means not working late hours and getting home late and tired. Getting a good night sleep is really important. 
 I try and keep active even if this means getting off a tube stop earlier and walking and not taking lifts if its only a few floors to walk. 
 Being Happy is really important. This means planning activities which are fun. This for me includes outings to cinema and theatre

With regard to food I have a bad addiction to carbs which I have  keep an eye on. have changed from red meat to chicken as it contains less fat and cholesterol 
 Have changed from full fat milk to skimmed as it contains lesS fat 
 Have changed from sugar to sweetener over the years one picks up all sorts of information and advice from magazines e.g. Sunday supplement from the Sunday Times and Observer  From health programme documentaries. Particularly like the programmes headed my Dr Michael Mosley   From newspaper articles in the Guardian and Times  I generally trust these sources as they are based on scientific facts and examples of how they have worked over the years one picks up all sorts of information and advice from magazines e.g. Sunday supplement from the Sunday Times and Observer  From health programme documentaries. Particularly like the programmes headed my Dr Michael Mosley   From newspaper articles in the Guardian and Times  I generally trust these sources as they are based on scientific facts and examples of how they have worked 1. I do agree. It’s an ongoing journey for me as I’ve always struggled with my weight. 
 I think that too much emphasis has been placed on the ‘five a day’ method. 
 2. Have heard of taking daily exercise by way of walking. 
 3. The 5:2  Diet method where you reduce your food intake to 500 calories for two days of the week and then eat freely for the other five days 4. Atkins or low carb diet  ——————————— I was looking to lose weight so used the low  carb method where I cut out almost all foods that contained flour or sugar. It worked well as I lost four stone. It was fairy easy to do provided I made sure I i had the correct foods at home such as proteins and vedgetables.  The benefits were not feeling hungry however the diet Ian quite expensive as you cannot eat cheap processed food.  What helped me maintain the diet was the easy way Iost weights on it I felt very upset when diagnosed with high cholesterol. I thought I was one of the healthier ones. I began to feel that I wasn't as healthy as I once thought 
 I immediately told my girlfriend and parents 
 I starts to research info about cholesterol on the internet.  Also read up about statins and downloaded a book The. Great cholesterol Myth which made me feel a little better but confused me regarding  the benefits of taking  statins  The book made me decide to try to lower my cholesterol by losing weight and doing more exercise.  However a year later my cholesterol levels had not changed and therefore started to take the statins and as a result my cholesterol is now back to a normal level Bought a few on sale Easter eggs 
 A ready meal of sausages and a few bars of green and black chocolate mash.they were both impulse buys. Couldn’t resist the Cadbury’s Easter eggs as they were only a £1 each. 
 The sausages were because I was feeling too lazy to make lunch on Saturday. I didn’t read any of the packaging as I already knew what he food contained. 
 Was a fairly normal week besides there being a bank holiday weekend so didn’t feel like cooking too much and had a meal out with friend as well as ordering an Indian take away",Falafel,
264467,Allison ,Waite ,allison.waite986@gmail.com,"1. We do our big shop every 2 weeks. I plan what to buy based on what we have left in the cupboard/fridge/freezer. Also based on who’s going to be at home on what day. I have to take school, work and the multitude of appointments my partner and son have. It also can depend on the weather. If it’s really cold for example I will cook more winter type dinners (roast, stew, casserole etc) 
 2. I just decide on what we need and what we don’t. I don’t like buying junk food and I don’t like to buy loads of unhealthy snacks. We have an Asda/Tesco/Aldi/Iceland and Lidl right on our doorstep so if I forget anything or need a top up it’s  very easy for me. We also try to stick to a budget and buy as much fresh as possible. 
 3. My partner, my 17 year old son, my 13 year old daughter and my dog! My hubby doesn’t get much of a say because he loves junk And trash food so I cannot leave him in charge!! 1. Wow. Well my life a decade ago was pretty chaotic! The kids were young and I used to batch cook a lot of stuff. With the kids being so young and me being so busy I did cook myself and hubby a lot of quick easy junk food. But the kids always had fresh meals. So loads of fruit and veg. I didn’t really think about my own health, I was too busy and too exhausted! I was last on the list if you know what I mean? Also we had a lot of takeaways because my son was always ill and he was in hospital so much and had so many appointments that by the time we would get home I would be too tired or it would be too late to cook. So me and jay ate a lot of crap! 
 2. In another decade I see myself eating as well as I do now. But even healthier as I would want to maintain good health and heart problems run in my family. If the kids have moved out by then then I will have more time to cook for me and jay and I can cook a lot more dishes. My son is a really fussy eater and my daughter hates spice! I love cooking so I always enjoy it. I keep healthy by eating a well and balanced diet. I also go to the gym with my hubby (which I love) and I take my dog for 2/3 walks every day- as well as walking my daughter to the train station and my son to his bus every morning. We do lots of things together as a family and I always make sure Me and jay have time on our own together. When I can I socialise with family and friends and I make sure I always stay As positive as i can. I make sure my home iS always clean and tidy which I think also promotes a healthy mind. Cooking meals fresh and from scratch also makes me feel good. 
 
 
 1. A) my George Foreman grill. I love it, I grill everything. I use it most days for cooking. 
      My gym. As weird as it may sound, going to the gym motivates me To eat healthy. 
      The fact I always have fruit and veg at home And I Try not To buy junk so there is no temptation. I would say my 3 staples are chicken (any type...diced, sliced, shredded, whole, fillets portions) , eggs (biggest pack they have in Asda/Tesco) and Tilda basmati rice. Veg is also a staple but I change which veg I use a lot.  1 We’ve swapped to flora from butter (I LOVED butter!) We swapped butter because it’s full of fat and salt and its really bad for you. I use it pretty much every day for toast or sandwiches. I switched To flora because it’s 80% less saturated fat. Contained omega 3 & 6, and it’s much better for the heart. I will include a photo.  2 We’ve swapped To muesli from coco pops/Krave (kids were addicted lol) We swapped because muesli is much healthier. Oats, nuts and dried fruit is so much better for them and us. Coco pops and Krave are full of sugar and additives and loaded with calories. Also bad for the teeth. We eat it most mornings but my son won’t touch it. He’s autistic and very funny when it comes To trying new things. The muesli was experimentation, so I literally grabbed any bag from Asda. They like it so I continued to buy it.  3.  We’ve swapped fizzy drinks to fizzy water.  We swapped to fizzy water because it’s a much healthier option. Our fridge was always full of coke and Pepsi Andy any other fizzy drink you can think of. So now we always have water, milk and fizzy water. We buy Pepsi zero as a treat at weekends. Water and fizzy water gets drunk all day every day in my house. You wouldn’t believe how much I have To buy every week! We’ve bought every type and brand of water there possibly is. But we all like Asda/Tesco’s own brand so I stick To that mainly. I have to buy so much of it every week that it helps that it’s cheaper being store branded. 
 Is there anything I’d like to swap? I don’t love to start using cous cous more, I’d like to use quinoa and tofu but nobody would eat it. I really want to start using quorn but I don’t want anyone to know I’m using it. So I’d have to hide it otherwise I know the kids would refuse! Lol All of the things I do come from a variety of sources. News, adverts, articles, books, tv, college, doctors, friends, family and social media. Facebook is a good one for learning about new ways to keep healthy and for new recipes. Everything I do has come from a source that I trust, but to be honest, I think nowadays it’s all common sense. You don’t really have To do much research or Be that knowledgable. But I do listen to all my doctors recommendations. Mum has just been diagnosed with high blood pressure and cholesterol, so all the new information I have has come straight from the British Heart Foundation.

Being fit and healthy is something you should be doing for the rest of your life. It should never stop. As you age you many need to alter the exercise you do, or the food you eat because of problems, but you should never stop. The fitter and healthier you are, the better you feel mentally. And that’s really really important. 
 2. Their are loads of healthy habits! Any sports, gym, exercise, 5 a day, drink loads of water, veganism, vegetarianism, low carb diet, low salt diet, pure protein diet, soup diet, gluten free diet. Etc. There are loadS! 
 3. Low carb diet and going to the gym. I wanted to get fit and toned and drop a bit of weight. I knew that doing the gym would go hand in hand with the eating plan because the gym would motivate me (as well as being able to see the results).  The challenge was cutting way down on carbs. I love bread, pasta and potatoes. I could eat them all day every day. When the kids are making toast it’s particularly hard. I was a bread addict lol. So it’s  been a challenge but I must say I’m doing pretty well! 
 The benefits are that im fitter and healthier and now I eat much less carbs but also my portion size is a lot smaller. So I’ve dropped a bit of weight, I’m more toned and I love seeing the results in my body. It also helps me sleep better and I have a lot less IBS. 
 It’s been easier for me because my family and friends have been so supportive and encouraging. Especially my Mum, brother and hubby. It’s  been easier to maintain now that’s hubby is doing it with me. And I make sure as much as I can that we don’t have junk food in the house and that we regularly go gym. Jay is great for motivating me in the gym. 
 One of my best mates is a really big lad. I hate using the word fat, but he is like 20 stone. He started coming gym and eating better, and was doing ok. But then he started saying he was too tired to come to the gym, and he decided he couldn’t give up all the fast food. He tried Too join the police but he got rejected. He took it hard, then he just gave up. He failed because I don’t think he really cares, and he is seriously lazy! 1. Really upset and worried. Very concerned. 2. My mum because she has just been diagnosed and was in hospital 2 weeks ago. So now she has learnt as much as she can about cholesterol so I would know that she would know what to say to me and how to help me. 3. I rang my mum and spoke to her about it and she told me to head over to the British heart Foundation website. So I went to the website and read as much as I could. I wanted primarily to find out how to reduce it. Which I did. 4. I have decided to give up cheese and I will start drinking decaf tea. I’m going to try and do even more exercise and try my hardest to give up smoking. 1. Yes, quite a lot of chocolate! Easter eggs were on sale and I’m a sucker for an Easter egg. More cheese than I wanted to buy. And mayonnaise. 
 2.  Well I have to admit I do love cheese, but everyone in the house loves cheese. The Easter eggs were all me! Nobody bought me one this year so I got a bit over excited when I saw the Asda egg sale. I know it’s naughty, but Easter is only once a year! (Self justification!!) and the mayo is for my daughter who is addicted!! 
 3. No, in all honesty I didn’t check any packets. I did the big shop online and I didn’t need even think about it. 
 4. When I eat chocolate it makes me feel really good. I guess it releases something in my brain. It’s pure self indulgence. I don’t normally buy that much. And with the cheese, it just makes everything taste better...cheese on everything!! But I really am going to try and either cut it down or cut it out. 
 5. Yes I would consider this a normal week.",Falafel,
262620,Monica,Rushton,mia@dsl.pipex.com,"1. I endeavour to plan a flexible menu for the week for two adults to suit what is happening in life.  The list is topped up and altered when we have visitors and a bottle of wine added. The list has to be especially altered when the young grandchildren come for meals to accommodate their different tastes in food. 
 2. By planning a flexible menu for the week for two retired people. 
 3. I am trying to get a balanced diet with a few treats for two and ask if anything is wanted to be added to the list when we sometimes have different tastes in food. This is particularly illustrated when it comes to cheese and onion pies and oven chips! From a decade ago and looking at the shopping list I note that our taste  in coffee has changed and we now prefer  different instant coffees!   I would not have thought about buying a jar of  Thai Green Sauce.  Although olive oil would have been on the list then and foreign travel has given us a wider experience of tastes and food. 
 
 A decade ago we were both out working and convenience foods were very useful and takeaways due to time constraints. Awareness of eating and health was not an issue at the time as it is today. If you liked it you ate it! 
 
 
 A decade from now,due to ageing, I can foresee we may be less active and therefore smaller, but nutritious foods will be welcomed. Simplification in the preparation of meals would become a necessity and shopping for them could be an issue. I can still envisage I will still love olive oil, cheese, yoghurts  and oranges! Living a happy, healthy life to me, at this time of being retired, is to be able to experience, enjoy and share events and experiences with friends and family and those I have yet to meet along the journey of life. To hear the birds sing, the sea and sunsets are all very beneficial. To experience travel and different cultures and to snorkel in a warm sea makes me feel very happy!  Having good health and to appreciate it is paramount to me with health issues in the past and accepting what you can do rather what you can't do.  To have a sense of belonging to a community and to have inner contentment and connectedness to spirituality means a holistic way to a happy and healthy life for me. I endeavour to achieve this in my life by diet which is difficult at times! Exercise in the form of Pilates and swimming. It is good to socialise and have positive input from friends and vice versa. I find volunteering, especially with children challenging, but uplifting in contributing to a healthy life. 
 1 Salad to give me vitamins and roughage. 
 2. Fruit to give me my five a day and vitamins and roughage. 
 3. Yoghurt because I like them and they are easy to eat and they are low fat. 
 A choice of the above apart from yoghurt was instilled in me from childhood as being good for you. Fridge is a bit empty as I am shopping tomorrow. Things I do to eat healthily? 
 Why I chose these things. Things I do to eat healthily? 
 Why I chose these things. 1.  I agree on that health is a journey and ongoing in life whatever age you may be.  It has to be addressed every day in the form of what we eat, exercise we may do and emotional well being. To use the term marathon to me indicates a very tough challenge!! Health should not be taken for granted taking into account  the ageing process. Health is, I feel to accept  gentle challenges and to incorporated healthy options into my life seems more appropriate than a marathon approach to me! 
 2. Endeavouring to eat more salad and vegetables in my daily diet to get my 5 a day of fruit and vegetables. Also reducing fats and sugars by using alternatives such as low fat cheese And low fat yoghurts. To eat more fish is regarded as being more healthy as is to eat white meat such as chicken rather than red meat such as beef. To consider a vegetarian diet is another option. Having decaf coffee rather than ordinary although I believe this is debatable. 
 EATING MORE SALAD AND FRUIT 
 3. To have more energy and loose weight. To be healthier and get more roughage in my diet. 
 4.  The main challenge was to change my mindset after having to have a soft food diet after some swallowing issues and to re educated myself onto a healthier diet. To think of a variety of ways to make a salad palatable for me an interesting. Cucumber dominated at first, but now lettuce, tomatoes and edible flowers such as heartsease have been introduced. 
 5. Addressing and planning what I am going to eat gives me more control on eating habits. it has given me a healthier looking skin and roughage has given me regular habits! 
 6. To  ensure that the shopping list has salad on it or try to grow my own in the summer to get more involved with what I eat. Eating out there are more salad items on the menu than 10 years ago. Not buying pre packed salads saves on cost. 
 A friend of mine adores chocolate which is something I do not share although the occasionally bar is enjoyed! I saw how difficult it was for her to change to a healthier way of eating, especially with gifts of chocolate boxes and Easter Eggs. As she was going through an emotional time in her life she found it more difficult as it was a comfort to her. The emotional pull to eat it was very strong for her and it is difficult to be of support. 1. Very surprised to receive the letter as I do not smoke, have a high alcohol intake or a family history of kidney or liver disease. I rhought I had been eating a healthy diet and therefore did not expect to have elevated blood cholesterol levels. Rather shocked at the increased risk of a stroke or heart disease as there is no history of it in my family. 
 
 
 2.  I would immediately want to tell my husband as he has been precribed  statins for his cholestrol levels and has a history of heart disease in his family. I feel he would be able to give me the knowledge and support in this situation. He would also be bemused. He does not share my love of vegetables or salad and prefers chips and would find it very interesting that I had an elevated blood cholesterol level. 
 3.  On the Internet to find information about types of fats and healthier ways of eating and exercise. It was very informative  especially explaining familial hypercholestrolaemia. 
 4. By researching for information it made me more informed not just for myself, but about people who have the issue of elevated blood cholesterol. It has made me more aware of the benefits of a healthier diet and what it should consist of.  Awareness of the different fats in in food  and to look for omega 3.  It emphasised to me the importance of exercise for a healthier life and I feel it is something for me to seriously consider. 1. Items that were not on my shopping list were cold meats ham, chicken and beef, potatoes, onions. grapes, beetroot, marmalade, can of soup, cheesecake raspberries, blueberries, jelly and not to forget to mention a chocolate bar and fudge frosting! 
 2. The family were coming to stay for the weekend until Monday so the shopping list was longer and more diverse to cater for gluten and nut allergy and young children. The shopping catered for six rather than the usual retired couple. Although the chocolate bar was for me and an after Easter treat! 
 3. I had to look for nut free and gluten free. Gluten free bread was bought in advance. I then found I was drawn to the fat content of the labels before buying the item.

 5. Not a normal week as two became six at mealtimes over a few days with the family here which was lovely. Also one unexpected meal out for the two of us.",Falafel,INTJ
262621,Asha,Webb,ashawebb9@gmail.com,"1. Usually plan by making sure theres plently fresh veg and take out frozen meat or fish, this will start Saturday or Sunday evening. Checking what there is in the cupboard or fridge for the week. 
 2. Decided, if myself and fiance would be going to the gym that week and plan accordingly, so tend to be light foods, like fish, salad and potatoes. We tend to eat before going to the gym, rather than eating after. So not having anything heavy would be a good thing. 
 3. I would be considering my partner or 7 years. Who is also my gym buddy :slight_smile:, she like to have a say regarding what we eat during the week. A decade ago, would be different as I lived by myself, so shopped accordingly.  A decade ago wouldn't be a much options that we have now, i.e So many different cultures of food that we can choose from, more vegan and vegetarian options. I believe when UK was in Europe, so many different food selections was brought in the UK or London, so many people have been open to try different food as oppose their own cultures etc. My list would be different, maybe just sticking to food I now and been brought up with, i. e rice, pototoes. Now there is different noodles, cous cous etc. 1. Living a happy, healthy life means to me, is eating anything with a balance, plus combination of exercise. From not eating too much bread, more fruits and yogurt in my daily diet and plenty water. Exercising at least 3 times a week. Even the odd day socialising during the week i.e Theatre. Get to work at 7.30am (work in a school) buying my blueberries and yogurt on a Monday from Sainsburys, plus Evian water. Mixing blueberries and yogurt in bowl and consuming before starting my day at 8am. 1. Money - allows me to buy the healthy things I want. Top Three: Fusilli Durum Wheat/Pasta 500g, made in Italy Eggs Sainsburys Basics Mix sizes, British barn eggs 805g Basmati Rice Worldwide Foods 1kg 1. Changed from Fusilli Durum to Sundried Pasta, I find this lighter to consume before going circuit classes during the week (I eat before working out) 2. At meal times i.e Dinner before work out classes. 3. Sundried package is quite attractive and tell me how much it will serve and tell me that it prefect with pork or chicken. Haven't swapped anything else, due to not really searching out anything more, it must taste good too, not just it being healthier. 1. I feel the sources I use are reliable and dependable. 2. Ones I found via social media I.E Facebook and TV adverts, these pass a legal licence to make sure the information they give is correct. 3. I definitely trust my family for health advice and other things are common sense i.e drinking plenty water and eating lots of fruits. 1. I feel the sources I use are reliable and dependable. 2.

Enabling you to live a fully life as you get older in life, enabling you to spend time with your children, family and friends. 2, Successful healthy habits would be taking Vitamin C and Cod liver oil/fish oil tablets on a daily basics, helping your body with it immune system and mobility. 3. Helping to make my body stronger and be immune to things like the common cold, flu etc 4.  When I run out of tablets remembering to picked them up when I went shopping etc 5.Not having a cold or flu for a very long time (touch wood). 6. Making sure I took tablets at meal time i.e Breakfast, so became a habit in the morning when I go to have breakfast. 1. Quite anxious and nervous. 2. I would tell my partner who I live with, she my rock and also my mum and brother. Family very important to me and they would be give me support unconditionally. 3. Try to look up about on Google (High Cholesterol) and saw a link about reducing high cholesterol, how to go about it. Giving me information about good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. Gave information about things to eat to reduce high cholesterol and things to keep away from, very informative. Being active is also key, 30min each day if possible. I do like 3-4 hours a week. Course of action, would be to really take more care of things that I consume on a daily basis. 1. Probably only products that was different was Easter eggs, due to it being Easter weekend. That wouldn't usually be on the list. Other things wasn't much different. Didn't read too much on Easter eggs package, just which egg would be for which family member etc. Brought more tins of Nourishment, due to being on offer in Sainsburys, so picked up more than normal, getting that milk intake in a balance way. Brought my coconut water, also on offer. This week ate fish everyday, felt so much better for it. 
 Fairly normal week, maybe the odd bread, due to being off work (School holidays etc).",Falafel,
262623,Mitchel,Reid,re.mitchel@yahoo.com,"I like to mix my recepies so nerver the same thing every week, I wouldn't eat fish everyday or have bagels for breakfast everyday. 
 If I do eat light breakfasts, then a heavy lunch and a light dinner, often I would eat my heaviest meal in the middle of the day, just to allow enough time to digest and obsorb. 
 I snack on healthy things, and sometimes treat myself to pastry at the coffe shop, usually iced coffee at  Starbucks and croissant.. 
 Noone gets a say usually, but I do ask for options or ideas that might break up any repeating meals to my children.. I would think it might look more easily accessible, and be more talored around already prepared meals, grab and go snacks, faster foods. I Envisage a more comprehensive list, more lifestyle brands, healthier alternatives, and possible the ability to add meals that you prepare from scratch direct by texting meal plans direct to your supermarket, and having meal ideas sent to you. I do believe as Cost of life gets higher and our budgets degrease, it's becoming more difficult to eat good foods that are not filled with additives and E numbers, I think one of the cost of technology and evolution is unhealthier habits. I choose to live as active a lifestyle as I can, actively engaging my mind in thoughts that do credit some knowledge, some sense of fun and freedom. 
 I enjoy privacy and have envested allot of money in keeping my family life and data secure, but the best jewels are the most treasured and although I love to keep myself out of the limelight, I health and my families well being is omimum, and I  spend just as much time choosing the right activities to practice and master. I have always loved yoga, and consider the mastering of that art my next challenge. I have to admit to being a coffee addict and in the past would spend almost everyday in the coffee shops or coffee kiosk, as I result of my expenditure, I bought a very semi expensive machine that would make the job less harduous and less of an expense, but unfortunately then I would drink 4-5 cups of coffee per day, this had a terrible effect  on my body. My change of habit has to be to premium teas, I keep a few boxes, most of them have a stimulating but not glittering effect, wake the body and mind but does not stress or add excessive milk proteins or caffeine. I would say my most trusted source for inspiration is YouTube, although some of those channels have now been deleted or removed there are still a source of great ideas, and motivation. I would say my most trusted source for inspiration is YouTube, although some of those channels have now been deleted or removed there are still a source of great ideas, and motivation. I do agree health is a habit of a lifetime, and certainly a marathon. When I first began I wanted to just improve my endurance, just to feel better about myself in the day, have more energy and better stamina on a long term basis. My biggest challenge was accepting results as they came instead of overdoing it, or pushing myself to exhaustion. A little is better than nothing, so just slowly allowing my body to built naturally and greatly improve my flexability, and strength. I have become more accustom and hearing my body and going with the flow, just stopping the Erie to overeat, or to live on chips and dips is an achievement at times. it was alarming and startling but nothing that I felt I couldn't deal with. I would feel that I should call my GP to deal with it or to discuss the options available to me. I went directly to YouTube, I type in why a high colesteral is not bad and Pte the opposit. I really had in my mind that it was no necessarily a bad thing to have an elevated colesteral. I decided that instead of becoming too anxious about the process of changing my lifestyle and incorporating, more healthy living habits and ofcourse enjoying the process of change. I did manage to change the lust at the last minute with pizza that was on special offer.  I didn't read the ingredients, it was an impulse, I guess my thoughts were more geared around immediate dinner or just a fast meal. This was a relatively normal week, I don't always shop a the same supermarket, so I can sometimes get a top up or two from other local shops, but overall I managed to get all that I needed  from my largest grocery  supplier. I don't always get veg for I stand online as I like to be more selective about produce.",Falafel,
262616,Karen,Lee,kpl@karenlee.co.uk,"1. How do you normally plan your food purchases for the week?   
 I keep a shopping list attached to the fridge with a magnet - this s the list I take to the supermarket with me. 
 
 
 2. How do you decide what is on the list and what is not? 
 
 I add food items to my list as I run out, or when I take a fancy to preparing something in particular e.g. a recipe I have seen, then I add the items I'll need to the list. 
 Beyond this, right before I head off to the supermarket (which isn't always exactly weekly) I add reminders for items not captured by either of the previous ways, but that I buy regularly because I enjoy them e.g. Oranges, Bananas, Salad Veg, Sausages, Mature Cheddar Cheese….etc. This list will vary with my current preoccupation e.g. a desire to eat more healthily, and/or tastes I am craving e.g. savoury things such as Cheddars or Hula Hoops .
 
 Then in the supermarket, if I have time (I generally do), I will walk up all the main food isles and see if there is anything I have forgotten to put on the list or really want, but hadn't planned to buy - this is how chocolate sometimes ends up in my basket. Again this is mood driven and can also be a result of how hungry I am at the the time. 
 Also - I quite enjoy trawling up and down supermarket isles and seeing what is new and what is on offer or marked down - how sad! 
 
 
 3. Who are you considering when you write the list? Who else gets a say? 
 
 I am really self-indulgent because I am generally only shopping for me, so I buy what I personally like or appeals to me - or think will be healthy for me. 
 When I have guests coming for a meal, or to stay, I will shop in a more planned way with specific meals in mind. Also, if I know that there are foodstuffs that specific guests like, I will buy them e.g. Almond Milk for my brother and sister-in-law. A decade ago 
 Nowadays I work from home, a decade ago I worked in central London and commuted to work - this meant that I had less time to shop and would frequently buy ready meals on the way home. Also, I frequently was too tired to cook myself supper and filled up on bread and cheese. Nowadays I make healthier and less expensive choices as I have more time to shop and cook - and earn less than I did then. I now shop in my local Sainsbury's every 7 - 10 days and a nearby M & S in between, for some luxuries and top ups of basics. 
 A decade from now 
 
 I reach retirement age in 4 years, so in 10 years I might be finding things tight financially and have cut out the M&S luxuries. I would not expect that my main list would have changed in other ways - though if things a very tight financially I would probably plan meals more, cook larger quantities and freeze some for another day. What living a happy healthy life means to me. 
 Having the motivation and energy to do things and 'get things done' is important for my physical and mental wellbeing. When I have these I feel that I am living a happy healthy life. However, I don't always have them and feel that I often enjoy life less than I want to as a consequence. 'Doing things' might be work, cooking/baking, housework, DIY, craft type hobbies (I really enjoy printmaking). I also like the feeling of 'making a difference' I get if I selflessly help somebody e.g. carry an elderly persons bag onto a train, help somebody get a pushchair up steps. I suppose it boosts my self worth, but that isn't the motivating factor in the moment - then it is more about looking after people. Getting outdoors also makes me happy - though sometimes I need a push to get out of my 'slippers and sofa' comfort zone and actually get out of the door. I don't do it often, but when I do I find more adventurous outdoor activities like more strenuous walks (along the coast or in the hills) and sailing really exhilarating, but tiring - a happy kind of tired though. Contact and socialising with friends and family generally lifts my spirits and makes me less self absorbed, which I tend to be as I am single and work from home. I spent the Easter weekend away, visiting family and really enjoyed their company and the change of environment - and playing with their dog. (I've been thinking about getting a dog myself.) Preparing and eating sensible food makes me pleased with myself. Whereas (over)indulging cravings for things  like chocolate or crisps gives me a quick burst of happiness, followed by negative feelings and disappointment with myself - which doesn't stop me when I am in a self-indulgent mood! 
 Top three things that allow me to eat healthily: 
 See pictures and descriptions. Top 3 Staples 
 Aside from bread (any brand unsliced wholemeal or granary loaf or Warburton's sliced) and milk (any semi-skimmed 1 litre), my top three are: 
 Eggs - any brand, free range, pack of 6, large size Greek Yogurt - generally Sainsbury's own brand, natural, 500g pot Vine tomatoes - generally Sainsbury's or M&S own brand, small plum type, 250g pack 
 Three healthier option switches I have made 
 Oat Milk    - I changed from using semi-skimmed cows milk (though still use cows milk for tea, coffee and the odd glass or two) because I felt I was consuming too much dairy produce  - I use it at breakfast time to make porridge and put on cereal mainly - it was the only Oat Milk available is Tesco (I really wanted Alpro Oat Milk, which tastes better than this one and better than almond milk, which I had previously tried). Olive Spread - I changed from butter because it is lower in saturated fat (though I still buy butter for some cooking and the occasional treat on toasted teacakes), I use olive spread on sandwiches and crackers and in some cooking - I choose this one because it is M&S own brand and likely cheaper than Bertolli and comes in smaller packs, so takes up less room in the fridge and won't take me ages to use and go out of date (I generally buy Sainsbury's own brand for the same reasons). Decaf Tea - I changed from ordinary tea because sometimes tea with caffeine causes me indigestion/heartburn - I use it for cuppas during the day and evening when my digestion is, or has recently been, disturbed (the rest of the time I use ordinary tea, often Yorkshire Tea and currently Twinings English Breakfast) - I chose Yorkshire De-caf Tea because I already liked the taste of ordinary Yorkshire Tea and the packaging was attractive too, making it stand out on the supermarket shelf. 
 Switches I have not made 
 Biscuits - I love biscuits and have in the past sought out lower sugar ones, but they are dull in taste and have yet to find any I like as much as standard sugar ones - so that is what I buy. However one biscuit switch I have made is chocolate biscuits and in their place I buy ordinary biscuits (so, not really a healthy switch). Currently my approach is no biscuits at all - but it won't last! 
 Cereals - Again, I have tried the healthier, lower sugar versions and do not enjoy them - they taste like cardboard or are artificial tasting. I have settled on Kellogg's Fruit & Fibre, Weetabix and Coco Pops as the lesser evils of the ordinary cereals. My response to tis task is captured in the attached photo of the list I wrote. My response to tis task is captured in the attached photo of the list I wrote. Health is a lifelong journey 
 I agree with this and for me is something I have become increasingly focussed on as I've become older. When I was a child we ate healthily because that is how my Mother bought and cooked with plenty of veg on the plate (perhaps because of her childhood during rationing). 
 Sweets and other unhealthy food choices became more and more available in the 1970s and 80s and I indulged in them without too much thought - then realised I was overweight. I first thought closely about what I ate in my late 20s when I stated to follow weightless diets. 
 I found I could lose weight but afterwards always put it back on - and some! I gave up dieting and tried portion control, cutting out sweets and more exercise and it worked better. Though unfortunately my sweet tooth and liking for carbs generally wins out if I am feeling low or stressed or too busy to buy or make a healthy choice. 
 Nowadays I try to follow the healthy ways I have itemised on the list - but I lack control regarding quantities and am still weak about sweet things - hence I am still oversight though generally eat better than  used to. 
 Time to prepare and cook healthy food comes into it as well. As I am no longer career focussed I now have more time and tend to think more about what I eat and take the time to buy and prepare better choices and build better habits. 
 A healthy I have adopted 
 One habit I have  adopted relates to sugar - I gradually cut down my added sugar intake on cereals, in tea and coffee on fruit etc and by doing it slowly didn't miss it and crave it. I still cannot drink tea without a tiny bit of sugar (half a level spoonful) and coffee with a little more (a level spoonful), but this is so much better than in the past. Consequently, I now find really sweet things, especially drinks, unpalatable. Though I still eat biscuits and some sweets. 
 It helps that I dislike the taste of artificial sweeteners so I don't 'feed' my sweet tooth with them. 
 A healthy I have failed to (fully) adopt 
 One habit I try to follow, but am rarely successful, with is drinking lots of water (unless I have gut problems and that reminds me). I mainly fail because I forget to keep a glass or bottle full beside me and because, if I do drink a lot of water, I have to go to the loo a lot (which often isn't convenient). Reaction to a high cholesterol letter 
 Something like this actually happened to me in 2011 when my total level was found to be around 6 (it had previously been around 5). 
 I felt a little worried and determined to act to reduce it. 
 I cannot recall immediately telling anybody else. I certainly felt that the solution lay in my hands not with other people. 
 My GP mentioned taking statins as an option, but I had read about nasty side effects and decided to try a healthier/lower fat diet, exercise and weight loss, which were mentioned to me at the time. I was given an information leaflet and read lots of other advice on health websites (heart health charities in particular, because they are experts). 
 I don't smoke and drink very little alcohol, so these didn't apply to me. 
 Over a couple of years I certainly reduced the amount of saturated fats I consumed, but was less successful with exercise and weight loss. Also I tried plant statin/cholesterol lowering drinks and spreads (like Benecol) but then read on the internet that they could only ever make a marginal difference - knowing this and because they were expensive I stopped buying them. My next test showed that my cholesterol was at over 6. I still preferred not to take statins. 
 Soon afterwards I needed to start taking a daily drug for something else and it is known to raise cholesterol levels. So, my next test (which I requested) showed my cholesterol level had risen to over 7. At that point I decided I would take statins and my GP prescribed 20mg Atorvastatin daily. My cholesterol level quickly fell to about 4.5. 
 However, I did find that after a while taking Atorvastatin added to aches and pains I already had and these reduced when I experimented with not taking it every day (I read up about this approach on the internet - studies have shown that you don't have to take a tablet every day to maintain levels in the body). Therefore I asked my GP to put me on a lower dose and now take 10mg daily, because it easier to remember to take it if taken daily. The aches and pains have not returned, however, I haven't had a test since I started taking a lower dose, so don't know the effect on my cholesterol levels yet. Interestingly my good cholesterol has always been at a healthy level and one doctor (not a GP) said my ratio is only a little high. It is odd that GPs don't look at it this way. This was a normal week for shopping in terms of what I bought - however I only used my usual shop Sainsbury's as a top up because I: - did a quick shop in Tesco - went to GPs and parked in Tesco car park  - explored Lidl when I had an hour to kill because my car was in for MOT nearby There were a number of things on my list that I didn't buy. This was because I had anticipated I would run out soon when I wrote the list, but on checking found I had more left than I thought - so put replacement off until next week.",Falafel,
262617,Claire,Sharkey,claire_sharkey@hotmail.co.uk,"I mostely do the shopping every 2 days and decide what to buy. The list varies a bit...i have a meat and 2 veg sort of man so not much vegetarian stuff. I make fresh cooked food evry night and often use up leftovers for lunch. I grow fresh veg and salad in the garden in season. I dont buy cakes or eat much bread. I shop in Aldis a lot and also the Co op as i find their food really good. We almost never eat out but do bring fish and chips home sometines. I dont plan menus but am spontaneous whe  shopping. I dont think i would have bought hugely different things a decade ago but for the fact of having a hungry son at home who had to be fed huge meals and packed lunches. When i have been alone...if my partener was away which happened more often 10 years ago...i would make more stir fry meals and eat less meat. In the future i can't see any huge variations in eating habits unless i am single in which case there would be more salad and cold food, soups and more emphasis on vegetarian food. I trycto eat food in season and organic if possible. living a healthy happy life involves eating well...not too much sugar or processed food. I swim 60 lengths 5 times a day and ride a horse 5 times a week...i do shiatsu and massage and work as a carer so it is a very physical life. I sing with 2 choirs and play piano to a fairly high standard so i keep really busy. My social life is about singing and my family with busy grandchildren to entertain...i eat more than i should but hopethe exercise burns it off. I take a lot of supplements to keep healthy and improve my mood. Three staples...rice...white or brown...organic mushrooms and extra virginolive oil I thought i did this yesterday...did it upload? Can re do I thought i did this yesterday...did it upload? Can re do I think the idea that healthy eating evolves during ones life is true. I have had many phases...one time i was macrobiotic then after 15 years of being vegetarian i became pregnant andi felt the need to eat meat. The 5 a day idea has really permeated our culture although i have always eaten at least 5 a day.  Part of my diet changes are about accomodating parteners and children. I know if if were single i would eat less meat...i am also too fat so bad body image..forms part of my thinking about food. I do avoid cakes and sweets but rat portions which are too large. Not I have received letters or calls from my dictor about this and there is always anxiety about them.  I always feel worried and for advice i speak to a friend who is an acupuncturist and expert on diet etc . Her feeling is that statins are not good and although in this letter they differentiate between good and bad cholesterol, often there is a combined number given. My thinking is that a lotof the original advice..ie eating margarine instead of butter, is wrong.  I would need to reduce alcohol and fatty red meat. My reading of the subject include skimming 'The Cholesterol Myth' and online advice. yes it is a normal week, some things that sneaked in...muller fruit corners for the grandchildren...beer for my partener...filled pasta as it looked great...ciabatta rolls for grandchildren...extra curry sauce for the cupboard.  I dont look at the packaging really...i do rely on trusted brands.  I have been buying filled wraps too much lately. Some snack things crept in..bacon bitesand crisps. Otherwise it is a fairly representative list.  The snacks mostely were added when i have long days...I have a very physical job and do have to keep up my strength...i do notice if i get low blood sugar i start to shake. I try to balance the weekly meals well...as i said before..an old fashioned partener restricts more imaginative less meaty meals.",Falafel,
262618,Kate,Rushton,krushtie33@gmail.com,"1. I don't plan anything. I literally buy everything on the day in the morning and going to the supermarket is part of my daily routine. I generally buy things on impulse.  2. I think about what is healthy and what is needed to meet my daily needs. I am on a diet and I have been sick recently so things high in vitamins are a priority and chocolate and crisps are a low priority. If something is offer, I am more drawn to it but coffee and a pain au chocolate is part of my daily routing.  3. I am just considering myself and my own health. I really don't consider anyone else at all. A decade ago my grocery list contained lower priced items because I was more on a budget and much more sugary/salty things. I think this was because I was less concerned about my overall health. I was younger and much less knowledgable about nutrition. I thought calories were everything.  In a decade from now I expect foods like Huel and Soylent will be more mainstream and I will be buying more ready made full meals. I will be able to pimp them up to my specifications and requirements e.g. flavourings and enriched with vitamins and minerals that I specifically need to enhance my lifestyle. I suspect that I might even be buying some more 'grow your own food'. 'Living a happy, healthy life' means having a balance of friends, family and actions that support and nourish my body.  I am not even close to living my ideal happy, healthy life. But to me, I am almost there because I start the day off meditating. I intend my day through guided meditation and kind of plan it out. Then if the day is sunny, I go for a walk in the local park with my preprepared cold coffee. I do try to make sure that I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. I also plan to see at least one person a day for a coffee or a meeting and surround/connect myself to someone new and interesting.  I also make sure that I catchup with my girlfriends in our group Facebook chat even if it is just to wish them good morning or a good evening. I just want to brighten up their day.  Every day I will do one thing that gets me closer to my goals, one thing that makes me smile and try and be a bit silly. A healthy life is not being serious! I don't really have a food cupboard because I am staying in an shared Airbnb, but in my room I keep some nuts and protein bars.  My top 3 staples are: Kombucha, Carpe Diem Own brand mixed nuts (small bag) for eating on the go Heinz Tomato Ketchup - it makes any meal taste a bit better and it has a nostalgia effect.  
 I am a sucker for cheese fondue and I know it is incredibly unhealthy but it is a very Austrian thing. I would love to eat a healthier version but this is my comfort food and makes me feel better on a cold night.  I also still drink a lot of energy drinks. Not as much as I used to. The challenge is that I get them free through work.  Another weakness is crisps. I love the salty taste and watching movies or TV shows while eating crisps is a habit for me. It is so innate that I am struggling to curb the habit. I have included all my answers as photographs of my thoughts in this area. I have included all my answers as photographs of my thoughts in this area. I agree. There is no quick fix for health and your health needs change as you go through different life stages eg puberty, pregnancy, menopause. You need to be healthy for the stage in life you are in and the priorities for that stage.  Drink 1 or 2 litres of water a day.  
 
 
 An apple a day keeps the doctor away 
 
 
 Drink kombucha every day 
 
 
 Drink a cup of green tea 
 
 
 Cut out sugar in your diet 
 
 
 Eat only natural, unprocessed food 
 
 
 Each meal should have a meat and two vegetables 
 
 
 Start the day off with a cup of hot lemon water to be energised and awaken your digestive system 
 
 
 Try to eat a colourful plate of vegetables or fruit, different colours have different benefits 
 
 
 Don’t eat after about 6 or 8 pm in the evening - not 100% sure which one it is  3. I manage to drink 1/2 litres of water a day. The really aim was for more energy and clearer skin. 
 4. The biggest challenge was fitting this into my busy lifestyle. Often it felt like I was forcing myself to drink.  5. The benefit is my improved skin and higher energy levels. I feel and look great.  6. I make myself drink at least 2 cups of water when I get up before I start the day. I also make myself finish the remainder before I go to bed. it started off as a chore but now it has become habitual.  I failed with the habit of starting the day off at 5 am with meditation. I am just not a morning person and I am often on calls with people from Canada or the US in the evening. This habit just does not fit in with my body clock and my work life so failure was inevitable.  
 
 
 I also failed with cutting out alcohol. As a Brit, drinking is almost ingrained in our social life and culture. Often I go to events with free alcohol. It is almost habitual to be holding a glass of something bubbly at an art gallery opening or a beer at a tech event. 
 
 
 I also tried to cut out sugar but it was impossible. I would almost have to prepare all my food from scratch and I just don’t have time for this. Really not good it felt like I was  given a death sentence but with no real actionable steps on how I could reverse the situation in a way that is manageable and realistic. I immediately want to tell my younger brother. He recently had to manage his diet and would be able to support me based on the knowledge he learnt from what he had to do. I also think my parents might panic or overreact. My brother could handle the situation.  My search started with google and the NHS and other 'reputableish' medical sites. While they told me about cholesterol and other things I could do, nothing was really actionable. I found some suggestions on replacements for high cholesterol food but none of it was bespoke to me and my lifestyle. Mentioning that I should make sure I have 150 minutes of exercise a day was not particularly helpful. Are there certain slots in my day where I could exercise easily and certain types of exercise that would help more than others? Are there support groups with people similar to me where we could discuss ideas and what we are doing? None of this information helped me come up with a course of action. I could not work out the realistic baby steps I should take to reach the end goal of lowering my cholesterol levels to a reasonable level. Which dietary changes should I implement first to become a habit, what next..? There were simply too many suggestions and not a realistic plan for slowly making changes so that the low cholesterol diet becomes a habit and manageable. If i implemented all the changes at once, I could not see myself sticking to the recommended diet. Also, there was too much to think about at once. It would be great if there was a chatbot or app with recommended daily changes to gradually introduce a better, healthier lifestyle, or a package that combines diet and exercise.  What about a simple questionnaire to assess your current diet with simple changes? Or, an app where you could type in / select what you currently eat and it makes simple suggestions/substitutions.  I really feel that a graduated and substitution approach should be used to encourage and enforce a low cholesterol diet. I just think I need a lot of assistance with this that none of the sites provided.  Some of the websites I checked out: https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/ Healthyhearts/Pages/ Cholesterol.aspx

Tortilla chips, cheese dip and cheese fondue managed to sneak into my shop, along with energy drinks (not free from work) Also, because I attended some events with free drinks, I also bought McDonalds and hot dogs after I had a few glasses of wine.  2. This was the result of a challenging week and a friend cancelling on me at the last minute so I just decided to have a night in with tortilla chips, cheese dip and cheese fondue on Friday night. I know it is not healthy but it is habitual and comforting for me to eat snacks while I watch a film. I automatically reach for crisps and I know I need to stop and eat healthy food, but I do like my chips. 
 I had a lot of early morning starts and late night calls so I had some energy drinks to hand to get through the calls. I know I need to establish more of a routine, and a healthy routine at that, it is just at the moment clients dictate my schedule.  3. I must admit I did not read any of the packaging  4. Not applicable.  5. Yes, because there is nothing normal about my life.",Falafel,INTJ
262619,Daniel,Hodkinson,danhodkinson@gmail.com,"1. I have recently been using an app called 'Nutrition' from Freeletics. This allows me to plan and write down my meals in advance and look for the best way to reuse ingredients to avoid wastage. I generally try to plan for 5 days of meals (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner). 
 2. I have to look what food i currently have in, when it's due to go out of date etc and then for each of the meals i decide. I also look at any offers on food/drink that could tempt me in. With animal products I always try to have free range, and organic if possible. For fruit/vegetable I always buy organic unless I think the price increase really doesn't justify itself. 
 3. I consider 'social dan' and my girlfriend. My girlfriend doesn't eat meat (just fish) or dairy products, so i try to allow for 2-3 meals that we can eat together or at least meals where I can add meat/dairy at the end. 'social dan' is about how busy i'm going to be that week, am i out a lot etc as that can impact on what i eat and where i eat. A decade ago I was just finishing university, so my choices wouldn't have contained any free range or organic produce at all. There would have been more ready meals, although I used to think I was buying 'good quality' ready meals. My diet would have contained a lot more simple meals like pasta > sauce > meat or pie > vegetables > gravy. I often wouldn't have time to do a 'weekly shop' either so it used to be grabbing things for the next meal. I used to consistently skip breakfast as well so my first meal wouldn't be until lunch time. The main factor in all of my purchases was cost. A decade from now I hope that free range/organic produce is much more the norm, i'll be in my 40's then so i'd hope to be more concerned about eating the right fats, managing my weight a bit more. I hope to live by the sea at some point in the future so hopefully there is a lot more fresh fish in my grocery list! Living a happy, healthy life, to me, is mainly about one key word. Balance. Balance with work, balance with food, a balanced life in general alleviates the ‘bad’ stress. 
 
 I have a tendency to work way too much, I have noticed recently how this affects my appetite and my relationship with food. I still want to eat healthily, but I find when I’m tired and my brain isn’t functioning right that I just can’t engage with food properly. I want the food to be ready immediately, and not have to go to the effort of making something. That can often lead to lazy choices when I value comfort over effort. A balanced work-life really sets the foundation for me in other aspects of my life. Working hard obviously isn’t all bad though, I enjoy being challenged on something I’m interested in, I just have to ensure that I’m working with ‘good’ stress and not ‘bad’ stress. 
 
 
 Happiness and healthiness in my day to day life comes from spending time with friends and my girlfriend, weekends away to escape the smog, or feeling like I’m properly getting in to a habit that makes me feel like I can be proud, like a fitness plan, or learning a new language. These really give me a good sense of happiness because I have an overriding feeling that a big trait of mine is laziness. 
 
 I also find I try to strike a balance over a week or so when it comes to healthy living.. I won’t let myself feel bad if I’ve had far too many alcoholic drinks that week, or a few unhealthy meals. Instead I’ll make a deal with myself that I’ll re-balance everything by increasing the amount of exercise I do and ensuring I have a few consecutive days of really healthy meals. 
 
 Top 3 Things 
 
 Nutribullet - I love this thing. It gives me a great way of being able to whip up a quick fruit smoothie, or make sauces for meals. I use it multiple times a week Nutrition App by Freeletics - This app really helps me meal plan, and when I meal plan I make a conscious effort to eat healthy. I like that I can go in to each day and change options based on what I feel like that day and it rebalances my day based on my goals The dried food shelf - not to be confused by the alcohol shelf just above it! This is where I keep as much of my dried food as possible so it's always on display and therefore easy for me to both think what i need to add to meals if i'm looking for inspiration or worried that i'll be lazy by not being bothered to dig through the cupoboards in hunt of the orzo or flax seeds! 3 Staples 
 Yoghurt - Yeo Valley, 500g, Plain 
 Bananas - Fairtrade, Bunch, Banana Flavour :grin: 
 Sourdough Bread - M&S, 1 Loaf. 
 Healthier Alternatives 
 
 Milk:
I used to buy cheap, supermarket brand milk. I use milk quite a lot in my diet and after becoming more concerned with both my health and animal welfare I now use organic milk from Yeo Valley. Organic produce has a higher nutritional value. 
 Vegetables:
 For very similar reasons, I switched to organic vegetables a few months ago. I often purchase the 'Veg Box' from Ocado which contains 8 selected vegetables. Containing fewer pesticides and being better for the environment were my main reasons for switching 
 Graze Protein Bites:
My snacks in the past would generally be the cadbury flapjack bars, or any breakfast type bar on offer (belvita etc), but I moved to the Graze Protein Bites as I really like the company and their approach and I also like the nutritional content of the food. 
 Should Swap 
 I'm pretty happy with my diet at the moment. I want to eliminate white bread completely, but I find the taste so much nicer that granary. Sourdough has been a staple to address this, but I could still go further and purchase Rye or Wholemeal sourdough bread. Sources My main source of information is from my girlfriend who is a trained nutritionist and does a lot more research than myself in to these issues. I also read magazines such as Balance and Healthy Living as well Fitness magazines which often speak about various nutrition issues.  It's so hard to find who & what to trust as a lot of information contradicts the other. I'm sure I'm as guilty as many other people when it comes to bias in my sources. Perhaps i'm seeking confirmation of what I already believe. But i try to have my foundations in animal welfare as meat is involved in a large part of my diet. And from there it's looking at what i'm being told and seeing if there is an agenda behind what i'm being told. That's generally how I try to arrive at what information can be trusted or not.

Health is a Journey 
 I absolutely agree with this statement. I could work really hard for 6 months, exercise regularly eat all of the right things, get my blood pressure and cholesterol to be in great working order. And the Doctors at my next check up could say I exceptionally healthy. I could then leave the Doctors and embark on the complete opposite for 6 months. Obviously this is unlikely to happen, but I know that for my journey it's always been about balance. I try to make sure that if I have an unhealthy day/week/month I make up for it by exercising more than I usually would as well as eating better and drinking less (alcohol). 
 Healthy Habits 
 
 Eating 5 times a day, at regular intervals
2 Ltr of water a day
10,000 Steps per day
 
 Adoption 
 Eating 5 times a day at regular intervals. When I get in to this habit I find it keeps me in my most healthy position. It ensures I eat my main 3 meals, at consistent times. As well as 2 snacks, which when I plan are also healthy choices. When I don't have this structure I often eat at odd times, 4pm lunches and 10pm dinners, skipping breakfasts and things like this. 
 The main difficulty with this is you really have to meal plan. Whether that's through 5 days of planning, or just deciding before the day starts what you will have. The most important part is sticking to the times. What works for me is sticking to 8.30am > 11am > 1.30pm > 4pm > 7-8pm for my meals. 
 Once I get in to this habit i feel my hunger is more consistent, when I know that I have my meals planned it stops me from taking a quick trip to Tesco and buying a snack i really don't need. My energy levels also remain pretty even as well, i try to make sure the snacks give me a quick bit of quick and slow release energy (oats, honey, nuts etc). Once I start to feel more energetic and wake up feeling better than leads me to being more 'able' to exercise in the morning, which, apart from at the weekend, is the only real time I get to exercise. 
 Using the Nutrition app from Freeletics and an Ocado weekly shop, I make sure that every Sunday I plan my Mon-Fri meals, ensuring that I try to use up as many of the ingredients as possible. 1. I felt disappointed that, even though I felt I was leading a healthy life, it was clear there was some failings on my part. I would also be keen on exploring the inherited condition to rule that out, if the Dr. thought it might be something worth exploring. Especially as my grandmother struggled with high cholesterol for many years. 2. I would tell my girlfriend and we would discuss whether she thought there was anything I was doing wrong. She would probably remind me about alcohol consumption and how this could be affecting me.  3. I already have a decent understanding of Cholesterol and my girlfriend is a wealth of knowledge for any further questions I have. I would definitely look at the NHS website about cholesterol again to explore it in more detail. I'm looking for information on where I might be going wrong, is the amount of activity i'm doing enough, is the food i'm eating right, or is this all something else. 4. I decided to speak to the doctor to rule out the inherited condition. I also decided to try to reduce my alcohol consumption as much as possible over the next 3-6 months. There are also a few other tweaks to my diet I will make. Although the benefits of full-fat yoghurt are clear when you have a healthy lifestyle I will mix it up with both low fat and soy yoghurt for more balance. 1. I purchased a reduced to clear easter egg to share with friends and I was at a wedding at the weekend and so, more alcohol than normal was consumed. And more filling meals eaten during the day that I wouldn't usually have eaten. As well as this I hadn't done any meal plans for Monday so I purchased a Pret lunch, which is something I try to avoid doing very often. 2. I was meeting some friends for a drink, and was at a shop and saw some reduced to clear easter eggs that I thought would be nice to share around with the others. I would label this an impulse purchase. 3. I didn't read the ingredients on the packaging of the Easter egg, and for Pret I only ever get the Tuna & Cucumber Baguette with Vegetable crisps, I am already very aware of the nutritional info. 4. For the easter egg I thought it was just a nice thing to do. And for the Pret, I was busy at work and just wanted a quick lunch that wasn't too unhealthy. 5. This has been a pretty good week. The food shop was a continuation of last weeks, I created a new meal plan and the ocado order is just topping up on the ingredients that I've ran out or almost ran out of.",Falafel,

There appears to be a lot more choice and offers with buy one get one free.  In 10 years time I feel it will become even more specialized with more concentration on healthily foods and drinks. It is important that kids eat properly and therefore what we eat is the same for them so vital we teach them properly. I am concerned with the number of sugary products and offers such as 4 bars for £1. It is a worrying trend. For me this means leading a happy life whilst taking care of my body. I try to achieve this by eating and sleeping properly whilst ensuring you have time for family and friends. It is not just all work. You rarely remember work events however you do remember great family and friends days out. I try to plan nice holidays, events and social gatherings. For instance on Easter Sunday we had the whole family over and had a lovely memorable time. For fitness I try to walk as much as possible between home, the tube station and work. I enjoy going to the gym to de-stress  and work out in classes. Shown below are  three good examples of new foods or existing foods that I have changed the way I cook. I would like to eat less meat and so trying other non meat alternatives such as eggs and fish. I have learnt a lot of ideas from generations, speaking to people, articles in the paper and TV programmes. I try to ignore social media and Google for information, concentrating on speaking to professionals and friends I have learnt a lot of ideas from generations, speaking to people, articles in the paper and TV programmes. I try to ignore social media and Google for information, concentrating on speaking to professionals and friends 1. Yes this is so true A good diet and heathly eating should be for ever and not in fits and starts. Yes a treat every so often is okay however it is important to maintain a good diet. 2. To limit snacks between meals. This can easier increase weight and ruin your main meals. If you do snack make sure it is fruit, dried fruit or nuts. Limit high in fat and sugar products 3.To reduce weight and ensure I maintained healthy diet. I have a sweet tooth so it was easier to look for easier option of chocolate. I had to learn to eat other snacks in between meals (if I had to) that would not impact my diet. I started to eat a lot of dried fruit 4 The main challenges were finding products of interest and not just fruit. I spoke with friends and read magazines for tips of reducing snacks. 5. To loose my weight 6. I drink plenty and also eat gum which can sometimes put me off from eating a snack. I question every snack I eat to try and limit There are a number of concerns with the letter; - Why? What are the main foods which has created this problem? What could have I do to reduce the impact? - What are the dangers of not doing anything? Heart attack, Type 2. stroke etc? - How can these levels be improved and how quickly? Is this a dramatic change to diet? As you can see I would have loads of questions and uncertain the risk that I was under.  I would go on to the NHS site and seek information whilst arrange an appointment with my doctor.  I would not Google! I would check what I was eating and make some quick changes. 1. I have been buying the boys some more treats as they are studying at home prior to exams. I have been buying more fruit and ready to eat products such as meats 2. Their exams are so important. Anything I can do to help 3. Yes to the extent of sugar and E's. I do not want them to be hyper 4. To fill in any gaps 5. Generally yes. During the warmer months I may buy more salad products and less soups. I like to vary the food as much as possible to ensure the family does not become bored.",Falafel,
262629,Charles,Brooks,cvbrooks@outlook.com,"I generally plan the list for the family at the weekend for then the week ahead. I take on board whether I’m travelling and whether my wife and the boys will be at home working or at school. In the winter and spring we will normally plan for hotter meals in the summer colder meals .  Present I’m getting ready for the London marathon so everybody is getting used to loads of different pasta  proteins and general carbohydrates .  I try to ensure that the shopping list covers for all of the family although there are some treats for the boys such as dried mango, chocolate, ice cream .  Is important that the meals can be shared reused and have multiple purposes . I’m also tempted by offers and special promotions  which can vary my list . I am aware that I can improve what’s on my list and do try hard to stay away from more fatty products however always appear to be tempted I feel food habits have changed a lot over the past 10 years. Nowadays I have a lot more meal deals then compared to 10 years ago and therefore will now eat more crisps which I would not normally have done in the past. There appears to be a lot more specialist foods in the market like grace and shakes protein drinks which claim to be good for you however concerned that although they may be high in protein they could be high in other areas such as fat. In the next 10 years I will see food products becoming combined and offering multiple ingredients as part of a controlled diet. There is also likely to be a lot of products coming to market which claim that they are good for you however only long-term results will prove this 1. Your body is like a car and so poor fuel means poor performance. Over the years I have learnt a lot about the importance of eating properly however do struggle at times with my sweet tooth.  If you eat properly then hopefully you can lead a heathy life which leads to a happy life.  We hear a lot about the right products to eat.  
 I have attached three photos; 1. running - I really enjoy running :runner:‍♂ although it does take a lot out of me. To help I need to eat as best as I can. This means that if I want to run I have to miss out on the crisps. My doctor has warned me regarding my fat content and diet so running is one way to help.  
 2. I have tried to find different products to eat which are high in protein and low  in fat content. The Grave products are expensive however rich in protein and filling.  
 3. I have always enjoyed eating fruit and veg and make a special effort to eat as much as I can.  All three  items are important to me to insure I can lead a happy and healthy life I have shown the inside of my cupboard and three products that I have changed. 
 1. I have reduced the amount of bread I eat however focusing more on wholemeal brown bread rather than white bread. 
 2.  I eat less pasta however more rice and with the special microwave packs which are so easy to cook and really tasty .  
 3. As I travel a lot I do snack a lot and I try to snack properly rather than eating chocolate and biscuits. The raisans pots are really tasty and less fat than a sugary snack Most of the sources I have typed are from Reading articles in the press, learning from mum, speaking to people, and general experience. Most of the sources I have typed are from Reading articles in the press, learning from mum, speaking to people, and general experience. 1.  Yes I totally agree with the statement .  If you try to maintain a healthy diet it will mean that you used to eating properly. As examples if I felt eating a bar of chocolate every day was good  for me and then I was  Going to change would be very hard. Therefore it is best to maintain a good diet. 
 
 
 2.  I was told by my doctor 3 years ago the importance of removing as much bread as you can and it does have an impact . 
 
 
 3. I now eat a lot less bread  than I used to and have replaced item such as crackers, pasta, salad, eggs, 
 
 
 4.  I did struggle at first however found there are lots of different products but I could eat such as salads. Interestingly llots of meal deals and 80% comprise of a sandwich 
 5.     I have been able to lose weight although not as much as I would’ve liked  
 6. It is hard to maintain however I have reduced my bread content by over 50% as I do it eat it occasionally 1.  The letter was quite confusing at first as I had more questions than answers  2.  I would want to tell my wife to get her opinion and also check what I should do  I would want to tell my wife to get her opinion and also check what I should do  
 3.  I would go onto the NHS website only seek information about cholesterol and what I should know . 
 4. I would need to seek a lot more information will before deciding on the best course of action. This would include consultation with my doctor, seeking information from the NHS, establishing leaflets, and generally reading the papers 1.  I am eating a lot more eggs then I for and also buying a lot more protein products  
 2.  As I’m preparing to run the marathon I’m very conscious of what I’m eating at the moment and therefore adding as much protein as possible. I was so surprised with the number eggs I was eating and bananas  
 3.  I always read the packaging especially the fat and sugar content to see what impact it will have  
 4.  I need to eat as best as I can and therefore by analysing my shopping list I can ensure I’m not buying rubbish products  5. This is generally a normal week although I am probably buying a lot more protein snacks than normal",Falafel,
262630,Nikhil,Shah,nik.shah@hotmail.co.uk,"1.  I do a basic shop at my local Tesco Express store on a Saturday morning as it is walking distance. I have an idea what to buy so do not need a list.  I have to go past my parents house when coming from work so sometimes i would go there to eat. If my parents have family round then i may go and have lunch/dinner there on the weekends. I would do one large shop once a month at either Tesco or ASDA by car. This would be much more than food shopping, it would include household things. I would probably take my time and see what is on offer and buy in multiples. 
 2.  I do have a list what i need but also if i see something i like or on offer i would buy it. I try to eat healthy but have a sweet tooth as well! 
 3.  I live alone, so shopping is just for myself. I buy things like sweets and biscuits to share at work. If i have friends coming for dinner i would ask what they would like or give them an option and buy it a few days before, as well as buy some snacks and starters. I am single so the
shopping list has not changed too much. Becoming older, you tend to look at
your lifestyle and make improvements. Also with the internet, social networking
sites and the age where becoming healthy is the way forward, you learn more about
the foods we eat and what foods are healthy for you. 
 There is
more choice for ready meals for vegetarians and better meat substitute foods. I
probably buy less processed food and eat more food where you cook and make at
home from scratch. I try to eat more healthy and cut down on sweet/sugary
food although i have a sweet tooth. I buy more organic food. My parents
buy me fresh fruit, organic as much as possible. I will try to have cereal
every day and would be the healthy type like oats, wheat, bran, grains,
granola, fruit and nut etc.  
 I eat far
more soya, fruit, vegetables and mixed nuts. I buy lots of various seeds that
lower cholesterol and add it to my cereal. I also buy multi vitamins and
minerals etc. When snacking i try to have healthy cereal bars or fruit. I am a
social drinker so will drink wine at home and if i have friends round. 
 I have high cholesterol which
is heredity in my Dad's side of the family, where family members have had heart bypass
operations and heart attacks, i am at an age where i am and should be careful
in terms of diet.     
 The
grocery list may change dependent on if i am married, living with someone or
have children. People are eating more healthy, people are
becoming vegetarian or vegan and people have reduced eating meat.
Manufactures are now making their products healthier by reducing salt and sugar
and the government are forcing changes to makes the nation becoming healthier.
The foods we eat may be far more healthy than they are now and children will be
eating less junk food. They could be super foods, bugs becoming part of
the diet as they are rich in protein, lab grown food and meat, milk substitutes
becoming standard and more plant based food. Maybe houses will have
machines that can male food for you or producing 3D foods - may not happen in
10 years but will in the future. It is improving your health , well-being and mindfulness. Healthy eating is about what you put into your body and the  effects that can show. Also doing physical activities, controlling weight and stress management helps to improve oneself. It is not just the body we have to look after but also the mind. 
  
 
 When reaching a certain time in your life, I subconsciously made an effort to eat healthier. 
  
 
 I have high cholesterol and it is heredity. I buy butter and yoghurt that helps to lower cholesterol. I also add various seeds to my cereal, some which helps to fight cholesterol. 
  
 
 The older you are, the more you are prone to health problems. I am a vegetarian so already eat quite healthy. The main thing would be cutting down on saturated fats and sugar.  I have always had a sweet tooth but now buy less sweet foods like sweets, biscuits and cake etc. If it is not in the house, then I won’t eat it! I try to by substitutes like cereal and health bars. If I feel peckish I will try and eat fruit or nuts.  I buy less processed food and eat more fruit (organic) although I always had vegetables as part of my diet. I rarely drink fizzy drinks, more social than drink at home. I drink just water at work, at home I was have a cordial mix.  Having a 
good mattress and enough sleep probably does more good than we think.  
 
 When I was younger I was very active playing sports but that all stopped. However I have recently started jogging. I do basic exercises at home, I had weights but they are broken so need a new set. I would like to start yoga. 
  
 
 Stress is now recognised that causes illnesses to the body. I have always been a worrier but now realise I do not have to fit to society ideology and make comparisons to everyone else and live within your means. Having a bad experience at work with a manager, I realised I would never go through that again and sometimes it is better to leave a job that makes you unhappy and ill. 
  
 
 Having good friends and family around is important, people who will listen and help you through bad times. It is important to enjoy life, smile and be happy. I enjoy trying different things. Having a balanced work and home life is important. I enjoy being around friends whether it be dining out or just catching up. Spending time with my two young nephews makes me just smile. I am a big football fan so watching football or the many soaps on tv helps me relax and something I enjoy. 
  
 Have a de-cluttered home and being clean and tidy gives me peace of mind. 
 
 
 
 
 Eating breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I eat cereals which contain oats, wheat, bran, grains, granola, fruit and nut etc which also gives slow releasing energy. 
 I eat a lot of nuts which stops me munching on things just to fill me up. 
 Being a vegetarian I eat a lot of vegetables. The three main
staples of food i have are bread, pasta and rice 
 I normally
go for brown wheat germ bread small size, 400g. Hovis is the main brand i
go for. I choose from Tilda, Basmati and Uncle Bens rice.  I would go for
Napolina, Barilla brand or Tesco Tortelloni choice for pasta. 
 I now have  Dannon
Activia or  Benecol yoghurt as it provides bacteria in
the gut which is lost through medication and helps lower
cholesterol.  I started eating more Quorn products as you have a
large choice and goes with any meal. Also it has high protein and tastes really
nice. Instead of having biscuits i now go for health bars as an alternate such
as Nature Valley and Belvita. 
 
 I am
thinking of having alternate dairy milk substitute.  There is a large
choice of different plant based substitutes and it does taste nice but at
the moment it is a force of habit! Please see below

 Please see below 1. Your health is journey from the time you are born until you die, it is your whole life. It is never just about a destination or point in your life whether you are in a good or bad health, whether you have a reached a goal and then stopping but maintaining that goal. Good health and wellbeing is an ongoing process which you can start anytime to make those changes, improve and maintain in all aspects of your life. When you reach that goal, you should not stop but influencing factors such as family history, motivation, diet, mental and physical health, interactions in social life and pitfalls may affect you to stop or keep doing what we are doing. 
  
 2. Healthy habits I consistently hear of are not skipping breakfast, slow releasing energy foods helps you throughout the day, reducing saturated fats and sugar, drinking 8 glasses of water a day, doing 10,000 steps a day, doing 30 minutes of exercises a day where you raise your heart rate and breathing, eat 5 a day, sleeping 8 hours a day, mediate, eat less process foods, eat less salt, reducing red meat, not smoking and drink within the guidelines. 
  
 3. A habit I want to achieve is to be able to jog a reasonable distance.
  
 4. The main challenge was motivation, being bored and saying ‘I do not have time’. I think I was scared to give it a go in case I failed. Knowing other peoples stories how they started, their journey, how they overcame obstacles and having reached their current goals made me mentally want to start. 
  
 5. I have high cholesterol and three times I had bad cases of respiratory tract infection and my Doctor always says brisk walking or any form of exercise will help to improve my lung capacity, lower cholesterol and belly fat.   
  
 6. It is not easy to maintain but i have to think of small steps and any how ever small the distances i can jog, it is better than nothing and i will see improvements which i see through my jogging app. I do not have targets and put pressure on myself. 
 My friend has diabetes, high cholesterol and is overweight. He has been told by his Doctor the changes he has to make. He is aware of what he needs to do to improve and control his illnesses but he has a ‘don’t care attitude’. He thinks life is too short, he does lots of swimming but then has bad eating habits. You are taken back that the results are not what you want. It is blunt that it says what can happen in the next 10 years. You can see from you results and what the ideal results should be and how far you are. There are examples why you have high cholesterol so straight away you know what you can do. 
 I only told my parents as they knew I was having a full blood test.
  
 You can more information from the doctor, the NHS website or just to Google any information you want.
  
 Yes I knew what actions I could take. It was reducing the amount of cheese I had as I knew I eat a lot. The obvious was eating sugary foods and saturated fats and to do more active exercises. 1.  The milkshakes and scones are not part of my regular shopping. I tried to avoid buying chocolate as in the minstrels. 
 2. The milkshakes were half price or less and i thought it can be a quick replacement meal if on the go. I bought scones as i wanted something different with my tea. I bought minstrels as just have a sweet tooth and thought it was not worse then any other sweet foods. 
 3. No i did not read any labels. 
 4. N/A 
 5. I probably bought more vegetables than normal but only as i was having friends come over to eat.",Falafel,

I tend to go back again the week to supplement my main shop. 2- I'll chat with my partner and we'll discuss meals for the week, that way we know what we need to get 3- My partner and I. That's it. We know what we like and what the kids like. They have favourites like Mac N Cheese and Spag Bol, so we normally go for those each week. 10 years ago, I was single, so I did far less cooking. When my kids came over, I would cook a healthy meal like a Shepherds Pie, but in the week, I ate out alot and at home, had alot more processed tv dinners etc  Breakfast was identical, Porridge, Croissants, Bagels, Hot Cross Buns, Toast and Jam, or Peanut Butter, alot of white flour ha ha ! For lunch, back then I ate out more, so processed sandwiches, maybe a Jacket Potato and Tuna. 
 10 years from now, I imagine very similiar to now, as my new partner's kids are 7 and 2, so family meals will still be the Shepherds Pies, the Spag bols, the Chicken dishes, the Sausages and Mash etc       ",Falafel,
262624,Tristan,Oppenheimer,tristanoppenheimer@hotmail.com,"1. I'VE GOT INTO A BIT OF A ROUTINE DURING THE WEEK (MON-THUR) - I DO ALMOST ALL MY FOOD SHOPPING AT WAITROSE AND STICK TO SOUP AND BREAD IN THE EVENINGS AND THE USUAL MUESLI FOR BREAKFAST AND SANDWICH FOR LUNCH  - AT THE WEEKEND I WILL USUALLY COOK SOMETHING DELICIOUS FRI/SAT/SUN DEPENDING ON WHAT'S ON OFFER IN STORE 2. IT'S VERY EASY TO DECIDE DURING THE WEEK AS I'M SETTING THE MENU IN ADVANCE SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH 3. I LIVE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WHO RECENTLY MOVED IN WITH ME, AND SHE DOES HAVE A SAY, BUT I TEND TO DO ALL THE COOKING AND SHOPPING AND SHE TENDS TO LIKE MY CHOICES AS WELL... SO FAR!! I'M AT A STAGE IN MY LIFE AT 45 WHERE I'M MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS OF MY HEALTH AND EATING AS MUCH FRESH, UNPROCESSED FOOD AS I CAN - I'M ALSO PRETTY BUSY, SO THE DAYS OF SPENDING HOURS IN THE SUPERMARKET PLANNING LAVISH MENUS IS NOW JUST A HASSLE - BUT I AM QUITE A ""FOODIE"" AND LOVE TO COOK INTERESTING, EXOTIC MEALS AT THE WEEKEND WHICH MAKES THE ROUTINE DURING THE WEEK MORE BEARABLE - I'M ALSO NOT DRINKING ALCOHOL DURING THE WEEK EXCEPT FOR ZERO ALCOHOL BEER, WHICH HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO MY WEEKLY SPEND ON GROCERIES, BUT I LOVE A COUPLE OF GOOD BOTTLES OF WINE AT THE WEEKEND WITH MY GIRL!! 10 YEARS AGO MY LIST WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT - I COOKED QUITE EXPENSIVE MEALS MOST DAYS AND HAD ALCOHOL MOST DAYS AS WELL BUT IT WAS INCREDIBLE HOW EXPENSIVE THAT BECAME - WEIRD CONSIDERING I WAS FINANCIALLY LESS WELL OFF THAN I AM NOW!! 10 YEARS FROM NOW I WOULD IMAGINE CERTAIN FRESH PRODUCE WILL EITHER BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE OR HARDER TO FIND SO I WILL MAYBE BE MORE FOCUSED ON SIMPLE MEALS AND AS I GET OLDER I WILL HAVE TO BECOME MUCH MORE AWARE OF MY HEALTH AND CUTTING DOWN ON FAT/SALT/SUGAR - AS LONG AS I CAN STILL HAVE MY 10 CUPS OF STRONG MILKY TEA A DAY, I SHOULD BE FINE!!

 PRODUCTS I WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH 
 CHEESE - I love cheese, particularly cheddar, and it's something I frankly eat too much of, but the lower fat varieties just don't do what cheese should do - They don't melt right or taste right and it breaks my heart!! 
 I'm trying to cut down a bit on my cheese consumption, but it's really hard so I guess it's become more of a treat nowadays I TEND TO ZONE OUT ALL THE RELENTLESS ""HEALTH ADVICE"" AS IT SEEMS TO CHANGE FOAIRLY REGULARLY, BUT I STILL BELIEVE IN EATING A BALANCED DIET AND ALL THINGS IN MODERATION - MOST OF THE BEST HEALTH ADVICE I HAVE RECEIEVED HAS BEEN FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY, BUT IF I NEED TO INVESTIGATE SOMETHING FURTHER, I WILL RESEARCH ONLINE FROM REPUTABLE MAINSTREAM SOURCES, BUT I WON'T SPEND TOO LONG DOING THAT AS I FIND INFORMATION CAN BE CONSTANTLT CONTRADICTORY WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHY EATING I TEND TO ZONE OUT ALL THE RELENTLESS ""HEALTH ADVICE"" AS IT SEEMS TO CHANGE FOAIRLY REGULARLY, BUT I STILL BELIEVE IN EATING A BALANCED DIET AND ALL THINGS IN MODERATION - MOST OF THE BEST HEALTH ADVICE I HAVE RECEIEVED HAS BEEN FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY, BUT IF I NEED TO INVESTIGATE SOMETHING FURTHER, I WILL RESEARCH ONLINE FROM REPUTABLE MAINSTREAM SOURCES, BUT I WON'T SPEND TOO LONG DOING THAT AS I FIND INFORMATION CAN BE CONSTANTLT CONTRADICTORY WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHY EATING 1. I THINK A LOT DEPENDS ON HOW ""HEALTHY"" YOUR ENVIRONMENT WAS WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP - IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE IF YOU PREVIOUSLY HAD LIVED A PRTICULARLY UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE - I HAVEN'T ALWAYS HAD THE BEST HABITS (WINE/RED MEAT/CIGARETTES) BUT LEARNING HOW TO NOT MISS THIS THINGS AND ENJOY THEM LESS FREQUENTLY IS THE TRICK - I DEFINITELY AGREE THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING THING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 2. EATING A GOOD HEALTHY BREAKFAST / DRINKING MORE WATER / SMALLER PORTIONS MORE OFTEN RATHER THAN 3 BIG MEALS A DAY / EAT MORE WHOLEGRAINS NUTS AND SEEDS / CUT DOWN ON DAIRY 3. AFTER TURNING 40 I FOUND THAT I WAS STARTING TO PUT ON QUITE A LOT OF WEIGHT AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WAS MY EATING PATTERN - NO BREAKFAST, SMALL LUNCH AND AN ENORMOUS DINNER LATE IN THE EVENING - IN ORDER TO LOSE THATOSE POUNDS, SOMETHING HAD TO CHANGE!! 4. THESE WERE HABITS I HAD BUILT UP OVER 30 YEARS, SIMILAR TO MY DAD'S EATING HABITS, SO IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE PATTERN, BUT I MY CONSCIENCE JUST KEP PRODDING ME AND EVENTUALLY I'VE STARTED TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES 5. I'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT, FEEL MORE ENERGY THROUGH THE DAY AND GENUINELY FEEL BETTER - IT CAN BE A STUGGLE, AND I DO MISS THOSE OLD HABITS, BUT I GUESS THE REWARD IS FEELING A BIT MORE PRO-ACTIVE IN LOOKING AFTER MYSELF 6. I THINK SETTING MENUS IN ADVANCE, SOMETIMES ON A WEEKLY BASIS, AND NOT HAVING ANYTHING ESLE IN THE FRIDGE MEANS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STICK TO A PLAN WITHOUT EVEN REALLY HAVING TO STRESS ABOUT WHAT TO COOK AND EAT EACH DAY WHICH HAS ALSO FREED UP MY HEAD SPACE TO FOCUS ON THINGS OTHER THAN FOOD WHICH IS GREAT!! I THINK WHERE I HAVE FAILED IS WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISE - I STILL FIND THE GYM UNBEARABLE AND ALTHOUGH I AM FAIRLY ACTIVE, COMMITTING TO REGULAR EXERCISE SLOTS IN THE WEEK IS REALLY HARD - YOU CAN EAT AS HEALTHILY AS YOU WANT, BUT EXERCISE REALLY IS SOMETHING CRUCIAL 1. How did you feel after reading the letter?  Ok, so I have been diagnosed with high cholesterol before - I've had 3 blood tests in the past 10 years or so and the first was quite high, the second seemed a bit more under control and the last one was quite high again - I certainly never received such a concise letter from the GP informing me though, and I had to chase them up and go and see the GP to get him to explain the blood results to me - My blood glucose is also quite high, but in the 10 minute slot I get with the GP he simply told me which foods to stay away from and to stop smoking - That was really about it, so it did come as quite a shock, made me acutely aware that I was getting older and depressed that I might no longer be able to enjoy food like I used to 2. Who do you immediately want to tell? Why?  My Dad and my partner - Mainly for advice from my Dad, as he also has high cholesterol and is on statins - And my girlfriend to tell that we may need to change some of our bad habits 3. Did you try to find out more information about cholesterol? Where from? Where did your search take you? What information are you looking for?  Not really - I've become wary of researching medical issues online as it can sometimes become overwhelming and cause increased anxiety, so I try to get as much info as is necessary from my GP 4. Did this information help you decide on a course of action? How did you come to this decision? It seemed pretty straightforward what I needed to do to reduce the cholesterol, which foods to cut down on, and clearly to dramatically cut out cigarettes and get into the habit of taking more regular exercise which is basically the plan of action today and into the future!! 1. Are there any products that managed to ‘sneak’ their way into your basket? What products did you buy that weren’t originally on your shopping list?  Not really - I guess I am a little more spontaneous about what to cook at the weekend, but the weekday food was pretty much the same as usual, soup and bread - I think most of what I bought could be considered pretty ""healthy"" 2. What made you add these? Talk us through your decision.  I guess the Thai curry ready meal was a bit of a treat for a Friday night but it wasn't particularly ""bad"" as far as it goes - I tend to think certain ready meals aren't going be a problem as long as it's only an occasional thing 3. Did you read any of the packaging before deciding? If yes, what parts interested you the most?  I usually tend to glance at the traffic lights on packaging - More green, less orange/red 4. What did you hope to get out of buying these?  I guess a little variety as soup and bread can get quite boring during the week - I do like spicy food as well and that makes it a bit more of a ""treat"" 5. Would you consider this a ‘normal week’? Yes, I guess so, particularly during the week, but weekends can sometimes be quite varied as I prefer to cook something more interesting",Falafel,
262625,Dana,Haughton ,danahaughton@hotmail.com,"1.  I normally plan weekly shopping by planning what the evening meals will be for that week and buy accordingly.  I normally stick to the same meals and rarely vary them.  
 2.  I check the fridge, freezer and cupboards to see what we have and don’t have.  Condiments, etc are not bought weekly. 
 3. I consider the whole family. I don’t consult anyone else as I know what everyone likes. I tend to buy the same things for the whole family. The kids do sometimes make requests but these are usuklay unhealthy options so I don’t tend to listen to them! A decade ago my list would have been filled with a lot more unhealthy options. I probably would have listened to the kids requests a lot mire then as I had less kids and they would have been younger so I would have been looking for things they would like to eat.  I myself have become more health conscious and have cut certain things from my diet.  Ten years from now my list will probably be shorter as the kids grow up and leave home. I suspect my diet will change as I get older. There will be more fruit and veg and less snacks. Beinf healthy for me means trying to eat healthily as much as possible. Not giving in to cravings. Limiting the times I eat out, not buying things I know I will be tempted to eat. Some would say I was cruel to myself and not living freely. But to me eating healthily brings me happeness and joy. I feel invigorated and in control and not down and depressed which is how I would feel if I was to give in to cravings. A short high for a long sadness! I don’t have time to exercise as I live a very busy life but I used my eating habits to compensate my lack of exercise. I have changed from cow’s milk to Almond Milk. I think that Almond Milk is healthier option for me as it’s lighter in texture, makes me feel less bloated and contains less calories.  I have also changed from rice to quinoa for myself. It’s as versatile as rice but is less bloating and contains fewer calories.  I have also changed from white bread to brown for myself. I find that I get heartburn if I eat white bread and it also used to make me constipated. Instagram - I follow a lot of people who follow a plant based diet for extra tips on recipes, etc I use Dr Axe a lot in YouTube for extras health tips as he uses a lot of natural herbal remedies which I find to be sometimes more beneficial the conventional medicines. I find them useful because they all work! Instagram - I follow a lot of people who follow a plant based diet for extra tips on recipes, etc I use Dr Axe a lot in YouTube for extras health tips as he uses a lot of natural herbal remedies which I find to be sometimes more beneficial the conventional medicines. I find them useful because they all work! 1.  Most definitely. Yo-yo dieting has never worked. To maintain a healthy weight (I associate a healthy weight with good health) you have to have a lifestyle change.  2.  Increasing water intake, ph balance diet, blood type diet, plant based, alkaline diet.  3. Lose weight, grow hair and glowing skin.  4. Limited choice if foods. Found different recipes online. Spoke to people who were also plant based.  5. Weight loss. Longer hair. Glowing skin. Much more energy. Good digestive system.  6. My ever reading up on the diet and always seeking more information has been very beneficial. I take supplements which really helps to make sure I am getting everything I need nutritionally. This has helped immensely.  I think people make fail if they don’t do enough research about any diet or lifestyle change. 1.  Sad and shocked. 2.  My sister. Her diet and alcohol intake is very bad. I mysel was unaware that an increase in alcohol could cause your cholesterol to go up.    3. I myself am aware of the dangers of increased cholesterol which is why I take the steps I do for my health. I was I unaware if the implications of high alcohol intake raising cholesterol which I did google but didn’t find a lot of information in this. This surprised me as I thought it would be well documented. I am concerned about my alcohol intake and am trying to limit it as a result of that. French bread - I added this as my daughter had a friend ove to play and I needed to prepare lunch for a few children 
 Chicken nuggets - again my daughter and a friend over and I prepared a little tea party and chicken nuggets always go down well. I don’t often cook them as I prefer to cook actual chicken when I am preparing the kids’ dinner. 
 Fish gougons - this was a treat for my husband. They are very quick to prepare and down well with wedges and salad on days they you don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen cooking. 
 I don’t tend to read packaging unless I am unsure of the ingredients. 
 This was a normal week until I decided to entertain my daughter’s friend and had to go out to buy additional food.",Falafel,
262626,Darren,Lessman,darrenlessman@gmail.com,"Normally do one big shop per month - then pop to Tesco Metro / Sainsbury's when we run out during the month We keep a list as we go along - when something runs out or running low, we tend to add to the list. Sometimes my wife will go on a Friday morning if we have guests for dinner at that particular weekend and buy for that event but I tend to get most food monthly! Generally feed the family - feed 4 people - everyone gets a say but I have the final word as I go to the shops to buy it! If anyone comes with me, they can choose. We seemed to eat a lot more healthier 10 years ago. My daughter was one so we had more time to prepare and plan for meals. We would eat a lot more vegetables and wholesome meals that we would then take a portion of and blend for her. For example, we would steam a bunch of vegetables at one go, eat some for dinner and blend/freeze the rest for snack pots for the baby. She would munch through these like they were going out of fashion. The same for meals like spaghetti bolognaise, chicken curry and cheesey pasta dishes. We would try to eat all together too and all have the same meal. Nowadays, one child will have one thing while there could possibly be two other different meals made due to fussy eaters! A ""happy and healthy life"" to me mainly relates to how much time I get out of work to spend doing the things I enjoy to relax. This ranges from spending quality time with my family and social time. I enjoy watching most sports but mainly my favourite team of Tottenham Hotspur. I do go to the gym - although probably could go more according to my wife, I enjoy cooking - regularly making the family dinners and going to the cinema or relaxing at home watching movies and my favourite TV shows. Three things that allow me to eat healthily: 1. Steaming my veg - I much prefer steaming than boiling as I am sure this keeps much more of the nutrition in them. This is used most dinner times 3/4 times a week. 2. Cooking with my wok - regularly cook with the wok as it uses minimal oil and I just chuck in all that's remaining in the fridge for a tasty stir fry! This is used most dinner times 3/4 times a week. 3. Water - I regularly drink plain water all day and have an app on my watch that reminds me when to drink so I take in a certain amount each day (3,870ml) to keep my body a little healthier than most! Cheese - Cathedral City Mature Lighter. We eat A LOT of cheese in our house from omelettes, to sandwiches, to pasta bakes etc and therefore go through a considerable amount every week. We therefore took the conscious effort to go for a lower fat content option for healthy reasons for us and the kids. We used to use the same brand but the normal Mature product. Margarine - Flora Light. Also, we have a lot of sandwiches (for work) and toast (breakfast) etc. For a family of four, this gets used very regularly. Again, because the packaging says ""light"" we do seem to take their word for it that this is a healthier option than the previously used normal Flora product. Milk - Own Brand (Tesco or Sainsburys) Semi-skimmed. My son alone has three bowls of cereal for breakfast so again we go through a cow load of milk every week! Semi-skimmed is still giving him a good amount of fat and calcium but not as much as full fat would give him. He also prefers the flavour of semi now anyway so win-win!! 
 Any products we wish had a healthier option but not compromising on the flavour - WINE!! see attached below my list of healthy eating and reasons for them see attached below my list of healthy eating and reasons for them I do not agree with the statememnt that health should be considered as a journey. Being health conscious should accompany you on the journey but not be the whole journey. In life there are many things that should be considered including health. Things like making an effort to be part of something during your life - leaving a legacy. How much you contribute to society and how you are remembered by people after your journey has ended. This is much more noble than just being remembered as a healthy person. Healthy food habits include 5 a day, sugar awareness week, and the advert by the Government with the bright coloured characters (name I can't recall though!). There are many other good causes like the Obeisity leading to cancer drive. Mainly ones to cut out/down on sugar intake. I do like fruit so making sure I maintain my intake of 5 a day is very important to me. From eating plenty of fruit during the day and fresh juices / smoothies, i try to ensure I hit my target daily. It may not be a lot, but its something I feel will keep me a little more healthy! Also, I ensure I drink a lot of water in a day to keep the old system clean and fresh! I have an app on my watch to remind me to drink at intervals during the day so I keep on top and dont get distracted so to forget. Drinking fresh water is so important (i have read) so maintaining this is not easy but I consider essential. One I have failed is to cut down on the amount of bread I eat! Every week I try and start a bread free diet but come the middle of the week I find it too hard but I do know this would benefit me if I could maintain it. I would be shocked to receive such a letter. I know my lifestyle sometimes is not the most healthy and having a deskjob reduces my activity during a day but this would definitley kick start me into taking more care of myself. I would investigate further reading material on line and also make an appointment with my doctor for their advice. I would also speak to my wife and let her know - with her knowedge of this, she would nag me into taking more action to get the levels back to a maintainable and correct level. The information on the letter is good basic knowledge to seek to better the cholesterol level but I would liek to find more ways to reduce. I would go to the gym more, make sure I have regular activity during a working day and definitely improve my saturated fats intake - for me the easist option. Yes! A few extra items were added.  I did purchase the vegetables and fruit as I wanted and also fresh salmon and fish cakes. We had some friend over unexpectedly though so I also bought scones, doughnuts and flapjacks as well as some vegetable crisps. Also making the list was yoghurt, popadoms to accompany dinner. Bread - there goes my bread free week - and oven chips. These are an easy accompaniment to any meal when we get home late and can just chuck something in the oven! Also bought cereals for breakfast - mini shredded wheat and multigrain.
 Finally there were Innocent smoothie drinks (on special!) and orange and grapefruit juices.",Falafel,
262627,Anastasis,Theokli,taztheokli@hotmail.co.uk,"I replace food that is low or finished and shop around meals that I am planning to cook.  I will normally opt for healthy choices. I live on my own so buy for myself and if I have a guess for dinner they will eat what I am cooking. I will sometimes purchase alternative foods if my guest has dietry requirements. I normally avoid unhealthy snacks but will occasionally treat myself or make an exception if I have a guest and feel like being a bit naughty. I will however by these on the day as I do not like to have unhealthy items in my flat as I would end up eating them all. A decade ago I never use to cook and was not that bothered about nutrition. I was not concerned about saturated fats and if I was getting enough fiber.  I would have opted white bread, bacon, cheap sausages and loads of quick and easy frozen ready meals. On the rare occasion I did cook from scratch I would use ready made sauces high in salt or sugar. I also use to snack on loads of crisps. 
 A decade from now I'd like to think it woukd be similiar although by then I'd hope to have cut out, coffee and sugar and replaced all unhealthy snacks. For me it is a balance of exercise, nutrition and well being. 
 Exercise 
 I try to exercise at least 5 times a week. I do a range of activities to keep a healthy body and mind. This will also fall under social and well being as you can do group activities and reduce stress. 
 Nutrition 
 Generally I try to eat healthy foods and snacks which have nutritional value. I try to cook from scratch so I know what goes into my food. I try to avoids high sugar, salt and saturated fat. I look for healthy alteranatives. I take a range of supplements. 
 Well Being 
 I actively look to control my stress levels with meditation and Yoga and exercise. I have a good work life balance with hobbies and a social life, friends and family time is important. 9My 3 staples.  
 1) Ryvitta Dark Rye Crisp Bread 
 2) The Happy Egg Co 10 pack mixed eggs 
 3) Tesco 2 pint skimmed milk I am always reading about nutrition in form of various articals mainly from the internet. I'll often google random questions to do with healthy eating. Sometimes it might be something I've read in the paper or a health show on TV. I never rely on one source i will always look at other sources as a comparison. Sometimes this can get confusing because there are so many contradictions. I am always reading about nutrition in form of various articals mainly from the internet.

When we are younger most people tend to be more reckless with their body in particlar their diet. Younger people tend to eat more junk food and drink more alcohol. 
 As you get older the body needs more help so our lifestyle changes to adapt. One of those changes is diet. We'll watch our sugar and salt and saturated fats to avoid heart disease, Diabities and Cholesterol. The older we get the more adjustments we need to make to level the playing field. 
 Healthy habits I've heard of 
 1) Eat honey instead of sugar 
 2) Drinking water in the morning on an empty stomach. 
 3) Cut out bread to lose belly. 
 4) Exercise 30 minutes a day. 
 5) An apple a day keeps the doctor away. 
 6) Too many sweets are bad for your teeth. 
 7) A glass of red why a day is good for your heart. 
 8) Garbage in Garbage out. 
 9) Reduce carbs to lose belly fat. 
 10) Bread is the enemy 
 I succesfully replaced white sugar with honey. My aim was to sweeten my hot drinks and cereal but replace wasted calories with the nutitional benefits of honey. 
 The challenge is that in some drinks like coffee it changes the flavour. I gradually got use to it and my taste buds adjusted. 
 
 Health Benefits of Honey 
 Prevent cancer and heart disease. It contains flavonoids, antioxidants which help reduce the risk of some cancers and heart disease. Reduce ulcers and other gastrointestinal disorders. ... Anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-fungal. ... Increase athletic performance. ... Reduces a cough and throat irritation. I tried to cut out bread but always find myself returning to it. I find the gluten bloats my stomach. I think I failed as I miss the taste and the alternatives are very tasteless i.e. Gluten free bread. Also it is one of the most convinient foods when the cupboards are empty, you are on the move, or just don't have time to prepare a meal i.e. The sandwich. I would be anxious and confused. It would have taken me my surprise as I have a reasonably healthy diet and exercise regularly. I'd start to over analyse and pick away at things that might have caused it. 
 I would mention it to certain friends in my age group to make comparison. I probably mention it to my parents and sister to perhaps seek some sort of reasurance. 
 I would probably look to book an appointment with my Doctor to seek more information and advice. I would use the internet to look at tip on how to decrease my cholesterol and what foods or behaviour might be increasing my cholesterol. I would propably look at trusted sites like NHS. I'd look up supplements to reduce cholesterol and probably look at Ebay or Amazon to buy these products i.e. Plant Sterols. 
 https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/... 
 http://www.floraproactiv.co.uk... 
 The information has made me take the following course of action to reduce cholesterol. Will also keep and eye on it with blood tests every 6 months.  1) Take a plant sterol supplement.  2) Buy products that have plant sterols i.e Flora Pro Active 3) Eat more porridge oats 4) Reduce cheese and eggs 1) Chilli C/Corne in a can 
 2) BLT Sandwich 
 3) Prawn Mayo Sandwich 
 4) Houmous 
 5) Baltic Mix 
 6) Breakfast Biscuits 7) Celery 8) Cucumber 9) Carrots  10) Kale 11) Spinach 
 
 Unhealthy (items 1-6) I bought these to either snack on , eat on the move or just didn't have time to cook. 
 I new these items were unhealthy when I bought them because i checked the nutritional content. In particular I was looking at Satuarated Fat, Sugar and Salt and ingredients. 
 1)The Houmous was low fat so that drew me to it as an attempt to keep the dip healthy. 
 2) The breakfast biscuits where were wholegrain so high fibre but high sugar. 
 3)The Chill Con Carne had reasonably good ingredients but noticed it was high salt. 
 4) The sandwiches offered high protein but were high in salt. 
 5) The Bombay mix was an alternative to crisps but was high in salt. 
 Most of these items would not permantly go on my list as I consider them unhealthy treats. What I was trying to acheive was to try and get somesort of nutritional content and damage control whilst having a treat. 
 The only item I may consider as a permanent addition will be the Houmous as it was a reasonbly healthy dip and I used carrots, celery and cucumber to dip so overal will help with eating healthy.  Healthy (Items 7-11)  Bought these to add to my five a day Veg and because of the nutritional benefits and would consider adding all these to my permanent shopping list.",Falafel,
262636,Grant,A,grant_amey@hotmail.com,"1) I generally don't plan for the week, I plan for 2-3 weeks and do an online order... So the grocery list I uploaded is a bit of a mix of what I get on a weekly basis - mainly things that go off within a week or two, like milk and bread - and things I'd buy less often but eat over the same time period. Basically, I plan my meals and buy what I need, possibly over-purchasing things that are on offer but will keep. 2) It depends on what I want to eat, how many days I'm planning to stock up for and what the prices are / what's on special offer. I'm happy to spend more now to save in the long term. 3) Me, but also things I want to get in for my girlfriend (e.g. some food she likes). However, I'll often buy something on the fly on the night for those occasions! 1) A decade ago there'd have been more cheese and processed meat on the list - things like bacon and chorizo - and few green vegetables (no broccoli or spinach!). I've been trying to eat more healthily so have swapped the processed meats and cheese for beef mince and chicken, and reduced the amount of pasta and bread in favour of vegetables and eggs. I'd definitely have wine on the list too a decade ago, but I've been cutting back on that again just to be a bit healthier. 2) Ooh, that's tricky. I'd like to think I'd get healthier still and maybe have berries alongside eggs for breakfast, swap the chicken wrap for a chicken salad, eat more salmon, reduce the pasta and swap white flour items for wholemeal flour items. I'd also like to stop eating snacks completely, but I don't believe that will happen as I don't have the will power and frankly, without treats what's the point in living? 1) It's keeping everything in balance: 
 a) Time 
 -  You need to work enough to keep your job and earn money so you can support yourself - and hopefully do something enjoyable and / or fulfilling too. 
 - You need time to yourself, to relax, read, watch some TV, think about things, play video games, do hobbies or whatever you like to do 
 -  You need time to socialise and keep up with friends 
 - You need time to sleep (I never seem to give myself enough!) so you feel awake and can get the most out of your non-sleeping time :) 
 - You need time for ""self maintenance"" by which I mean cooking, eating, showering, housekeeping, exercising etc. Personally, I can't say I enjoy many of these things (exercise and vacuuming suck!) other than cooking and eating, but they all need to be done. 
 b) Food & exercise 
 You can eat pretty much anything you want so long as you keep it in balance and have no medical issues (diabetes, kidney disease, allergies etc.) and make sure you keep calorie intake and expenditure in balance! I don't like diets that prevent me from enjoying food - we've all got to die of something sometime! Staples: - 5% beef mince, 900g, Iceland - Skinless chicken breasts, 2kg, Iceland - Eggs, 10 pack, Iceland Want to swap: - Pasta sauce to a lower salt/sugar alternative but haven't done because other sauces don't taste as nice so I end up adding bad stuff to the sauce anyway Main sources: 1) Published studies.

A literature review by the NIH in the 1990s found only one scientific paper that mentioned 2 litres of water a day, and that was an estimate of the amount of water required to fuel the average person's catabolic reactions (hydrolysis reactions) d) Stretch before exercising ... But not if you want to perform a strength or power related exercise, as the stretch reduces both for people. There's also little evidence it prevents injuries! Yeah, most of what we're told is just plain wrong. That's why I do my own research and try to use text books and research papers! 3) Eating regular meals, each one with 20-30g of protein. This actually helps prevent you snacking as it's satiating, so helps you lose weight and reduces your chances of getting e.g. diabetes by snacking on sugary things. It's also good for ensuring you maintain muscle mass (after age 35, men lose around 1% of their muscle mass a year unless steps are taken to maintain it). 4) Getting into the habit of eating meals (I used to snack a lot), making sure I had the right food in (no use trying to make a salmon dinner or a chicken lunch if you've no food in but you've got a Pizza Hut voucher by the phone...), planning meals properly (not nipping out for a sandwich/burger for lunch at work). 5) I definitely snack less (well, I still let myself at Christmas and Easter, but that's a choice rather than an accident) and this means I've lost some weight as well as building muscle. 6) Making sure the meals were tasty and close to what I wanted to eat anyway. There's no point denying yourself something, you'll just crave it more. 1) I'd be surprised and sceptical. I'd request a second test, along with a genetic test for familial hypercholesterolaemia. 2) No-one. I'd want confirmation first. Even then, I wouldn't tell anyone as they couldn't help me with this problem. Problems are only worth sharing if you need someone's help fixing them. 3) I know a fair amount about cholesterol (from text books and online research in e.g. pubmed, .edu and .ac sites, Wikipedia) and how to reduce it (also discovered from those same sites) e.g. phytosterol intake to prevent uptake of cholesterol, beta-glucan (from e.g. porridge oats) to bind dietary cholesterol and bile to prevent cholesterol re-uptake, increase mono and poly saturate intake, stop eating trans fats, reduce carbohydrate intake etc. 4) As I mentioned, I'd want a second test and if that was positive, a follow up test for the genetic condition. 1) Two packs of smoked bacon.  2) I forgot I was out of bacon when I wrote my initial shopping list. I know it's processed meat so I shouldn't really eat it, but I always like to have some in - it's so tasty and quick to cook. 3) I ordered the bacon online, so no - but it is the stuff I normally buy. 4) Bacon for variety in my food! 5) I tend to do big shops every 3-4 weeks and then have minor top-ups (milk, bread/wraps, maybe some fruit, bottle of wine if I fancy a treat) so yes, it's normal purchasing.",Falafel,
262637,Veronique,Chateauneu,veronique.chateauneu@gmail.com,"1 I usually do a big shopping on Monday morning. I like cooking stews for the family and have some fresh salad every evening. I try my best to buy seasonal fruits and vegetables. For example, I would never buy tomatoes, strawberries, peaches, in winter. I also try to buy as much as possible fruits and vegetables grown in UK. So During winter time, I cook fish twice a week. Monday morning, I go to the fish mongers and I buy salmon or Ray or different fishes either to cook fish pies, chowder or even fish with a bit of olive oil, salt, thyme and pepper. It always go with rice. As I am on my own at lunch time, I do not really cook for myself. I could say I eat snacks such as boiled eggs, a piece of mackerel, one fruit and some nuts (natural mixed nuts). I always do my shopping thinking of the 3 meals for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening.  I try to have first evening fish, second meal vegetables, third one meat... The reason is I only buy organic and it would be too expansive to buy fish or meat every single day. 2 I always buy what is on the list except if there is something out of stock. 3 Sometimes, my children ask me to cook something special. My youngest one loves roast chicken, my oldest one loves Lasagna, my daughter loves chowder and lentils. I consider myself very happy as my kids and my husband eat everything and it is  very pleasant to cook for people who appreciate what I cook. So I always try to satisfy their young appetite! I do not like to cook meals which take long time. I always try to select good quality food and healthy ones. It is massively different! 10 years ago, I had small children and the quantity were not the same at all. I do not recall what I was cooking exactly but I I have always cooked vegetables. I would say that what has changed a lot is that I buy organics. The reason is that I have started to have friends dying of cancer or struck by breast cancer. I also see more and more people allergic to food and I made some research . I found out that our food was loaded with pesticides, hormones, sugar, fat. I try my best to avoid process food. Before I use to eat a lot of chocolate, bars, drink energy foo... funny thing is that i had 10 kilos less but as I am menopause , I need to watch out what I eat. I also wanted my children to have a proper diet and show them the good example. Being healthy consists in two main things. Eating healthy and practising sport on a daily life. It doesn't have to be too long or too difficult but exercising at least one hour a day is really important. When whether permitted, being out is also vital for me. I am luckily as I work only part time. I have 3 children and I keep taking the youngest one to school. When it is dry we bike every day to school (5km) or we take the scooter. So 10 km a day is a good start. I try to avoid the tube andi bike to the city whenever possible. That makes me really happy. Then I try my best eating lots of fruits, nuts and vegetables. I avoid process food as I think it does not taste too good. regardind the products I have chosen ( porridge, alpro and houmous, I try to buy organic. The brand is not too important. When there is a promotion, I jump on it! lately, I had my sister visiting. She is vegetarian and we shared lots of information about how to eat healthy and food which does not harm the planet...plastic free, animal cruelty, but also how to enjoy a healthy diet and keep fit and sporty as long as possible. I also follow the advises of an French oncologist who share lots of idea about food. lately, I had my sister visiting.

I also follow the advises of an French oncologist who share lots of idea about food. I completely agree. Being healthy is a way of life. It is not something you.do for a month and then decide to do something different. There is one habit I started to have.I stopped drinking diet fizzy drinks. I was addict to diet coke and I stopped as I could see my kids doing the same. I stopped buying any kind of drinks with aspartame as I know it is really bad and instead, we replace it by tea, camomile and of course water. It was quite challenging as I was drinking at leat 2 liters a day but looking at a video explaining that aspartame was triggering  something in your brain for  wanting sugar and fat food, was scary enough to manage to get rid of this bad habit. I can't say I saw any benefits as it would have been on the long term that it would have caused real damages. I manage to avoid drinking it by replacing it by some drinks I really love as tea with soya milk. It was a bit difficult for a week but then I forgot about it! There is still something I cannot get rid of is biscuits and my glass of wine. I eat every night 4 or 5 cookies and drink a large glass of wine....I wish I could avoid it. I would be really upset and even frightened if I was receiving this kind of letter. I know the consequences that it would lead like blocked artery. I would tell my husband immediately and ask him to do a test as soon as possible. Than I would google and find out a maximum of information through forums, discussions and advises from the NHS or equivalent. I would find what the real risks are and tackle the problem immediately by changing my eating habits. If I were smoking, I do not know what my attitude would be. I do not know if I would have the strength of changing everything from one day to another knowing that it has to be for ever. Everything concerning food, sport would be quite easy as I think that it is really simple to prepare delicious meals with a bit of imagination. Concerning the sport, I can' live without it!. I guess I would try to cut down my consumption of alcohol but thinking that it is not for ever. yesterday, I did a massive shopping as I am hosting for a couple of days my parents. I did buy more meat than I had planned in a normal.meat as they want to eat meat every day. 
 As I am not a fan of cooking meet, I bought some already made meatballs and the sauce which goes along. Served with rice, that allow me not too cook too much when they are visiting. I also bought quite a lot of goodies, such as chocolate and shortbreads are they are very fond of them. Apart from that, I bought lots of vegetables, fruits, lentils to prepare the food I am use to prepare  as my parents have both issues with cholesterol. I bought some chicken avocados, with kind of food which help them with their health.",Falafel,

Family and visitors. I don't generally ask what they want, but I do learn what they like and consider when cooking.  Foe example my son loves oven chips so they are on the list for mealtimes when we are in a hurry! My grocery list would have been fairly similar a decade ago.  The difference may have been in quality - I can afford better ingredients now.  We have always tried to get as much organically grown food, which perhaps is a little more readily available now.  For instance in the past we used to have a lot of food delivered from Abel & Cole, but in recent times the quality of food in local supermarkets has improved. I  a decade, I expect that the shopping list will also be similar.  We try to eat a range of fruit and vegetables and I don't see that changing much.       ",Falafel,
262632,Andrea,Cathnott,acathnott@yahoo.co.uk,"I normally meal plan for at least 3-4 days of a week if not all. I decide what to buy depending on what food already bought needs to be used up and plan meals around what works /compliments them. I like to make food from scratch wherever possible and therefore buy basic ingredients that are versatile and can be used in more than one type of dish. I also like to try out  a new diah from time to time and may buy ingredients to do so. Recently I made pad tai and had to source the tamarind sauce and bought rice noodles and beansprouts, items that I would never normally buy. Staples/ Essential foods as well as those that are versatile are always on the list like milk, bread, eggs and mince but I may buy healthier options like granary bread and turkey mince for a balanced diet. 
 I buy for myself only and so this makes it very easy to decide what to buy and cook! I had a very busy life a decade ago and whilst being able to cook did not enjoy it so therefore a lot of convenience food and easy to prepare and cook meals were bought. I definitely bought more cakes and biscuits and ate fewer vegetables!  I now tend to make meals myself. Some of this is due to being diagnosed as a T1 diabetic 13 years ago. I didn't really take on board how my diet affected my condition initially and thought I could carry on as before. To a point I can but I have to ensure that this is moderated now and rather than buy shop bought cakes and biscuits, I have returned to my love of baking and make my own. This has helped me to become aware of how much carbohydrate I am eating and I can make substitutions wherever possible to lower the carb count or make a sensible decision to have a smaller amount. 
 Budget always is a factor in food shopping and I have found that foods that are convenience or prepared for the consumer costs more than the raw/original product. I also vary where I shop and what I get there. For example I shop at Sainsburys and Lidl to level out the cost of food shopping.  
 I am more conscious of what I eat and the cost than before as I have more financial obligations now and a life long medical condition that is affected by diet to consider. 
 
 In addition to the above, new foods are being presented and were not heard of in the mainstream at the time, such as quinoa, chia seeds and spirulina. So there are new food types to try out now and no doubt there will be more in the future. I think our diets will reflect that in years to come and may include some new food types or healthier versions of old favourites. For example refined white bread is giving way to granary and sour dough breads. My diet may include less dairy (certainly milk)  due to difficult digestion and may swap to an alternative milk such as lactofree.  Food trends and continued education about food determines what we eat. The current trend is to reduce sugar and refined foods. We already have a lot of products that are free from artificial preservatives, additives and flavourings. I think the trend towards healthier, sustainable options will continue. A happy healthy life means a good quality of living that enables me to enjoy life independently, do the activities that I enjoy in my own time. Being healthy enough to have a functioning body that allows me to do what I want, when I want (within reason!).  Good quality of life means being able to follow interests/hobbies, socialise  and spend time with family and friends. Sometimes this will involve food/eating out and or exercise/activities and so will combine all aspects of diet, exercise/fitness and well being. I do think it is all interlinked. 
 This is achieved daily for me in many ways...My family has a monthly family dinner meet up and each relative takes a turn to host. Various meals and cuisines are made, sometimes others will add and bring a dish. Food brings family together, helps to maintain culture as youngsters are taught cooking techniques and how to make dishes and so for me meets the wellness aspect in keeping a positive outlook on life. Sometimes there are physical activities (basketball and football games, hula hooping in the garden or even a simple walk in the park). 
 I try to meet my daily target of 6000 steps as often as possible and am lucky to have 2 large parks nearby. As we move into Spring, I shall now be outside more often and as I enjoy outdoor activities may become more active more often.  
 Regarding food, I am a Type 1 diabetic and whilst I carbohydrate count and can eat what I like , I am still conscious that I need to have a varied, balanced diet and that if I have low carbohydrate meals then less insulin is needed. This is easier (I find) in Spring-Autumn months where protein and veg/salad veg and lighter meals in general are preferred by myself. In Winter, warm, carbohydrate heavy comfort foods are go tos! 3 Staples are; Raw white potatoes (1kg Bag)
 Basmati Rice 5Kg (Bulk Buy)
 Minced Beef 500g 
 Healthier switches; Rice Noodles changed from egg noodles. Lighter and lower carb content. Eaten weekly. Recommended by a relative when they used them at a family dinner, tried it and like it also.
 Reduced Fat Tinned Milk used as and when. I have used for a long time after I found the normal one too creamy and difficult to digest.
 Organic Bananas changed from regular bananas trying to reduce pesticide consumption and I have found that they last longer and taste better. eaten weekly/1 a day. Bought as regular ones were sold out and poor quality remained so bought them. They were more expensive but I found they lasted longer and tasted better and kept buying them since.
 Granary Bread reduced consumption of white bread. Seeded rolls are better for my digestion and raise my blood glucose levels slowly (higher glycaemic index). Used weekly. Recommended by a health professional who said that more grains would increase my fibre and may help with digestion and bowels. 
 I would like to swap drinks like cola or carbonated soft drinks but I do not like the lower sugar/sugar free versions and I need the high sugar variants to treat hypoglycaemic episodes at times. Lucozade is the preferred option but they are all prone to sugar tax now. This I do not agree with for diabetics that need these drinks as a quick treatment rather than for regular consumption. I also used the Diabetes UK website for further information I also used the Diabetes UK website for further information 1. I fully agree with the statement. That has been very true for me in that my eating habits have changed considerably from my 20's when I ate what I wanted when I wanted and as much as I wanted! I don't deprive myself of anything now, but I may eat in moderation or consider making a healthier alternative myself. My eating habits are to help me live an enjoyable,high quality of life for as long as possible so the fuel that I use to keep my machine going needs to be as high quality and additive free as possible. 
 2. I have heard of lower carb, vegan/vegetarian diets. Using healthier cooking methods such as steaming and new foods such as Chia seeds, Kale and Spirulina (that I have yet to try). As well as 5 a day, which I try to meet as often as possible as well as more fish. This is something that I have done for a while and try to eat at least 2 portions a week. 
 3.  Eating 5 frut and veg a day has been adopted for a while as well as eating lower carb meals. These have been easy to adopt as I will have 2 portions of fruit a day-1 at breakfast (banana) and another later in the day (usually an apple/pear or 2 plums) and then I will add veg to my evening meal (sometimes a salad in spring/summer or steamed veg in colder months. If I have a lower carb meal or day then the veg content will be higher. So I am able to combine these 2 healthy eating habits whenever possible.  It was difficult to adopt at first as I felt that a meal was not complete unless there was carbohydrate on the plate (rice/potatoes/pasta) and would not feel full but as time has passed I now feel full and feel less bloated.  I also find it easier when eating out to adopt a low carb option as I do not have to carb count as much ant take as much insulin. Meal planning has helped to ensure that I keep to a healthier diet and buying foods that accompany each other with a variety of veg e.g mushrooms, sweet peppers, lettuce, broccoli and and beansprouts can be used in spanish omelette, stir fried noodles or rice or vegetable lasagne.  
 A friend of mine has been on a strict calorie controlled diet but it has not been sustainable as she feels that she is depriving herself of the foods that she likes and does not feel it is something that she would do long term. She has not been advised to look at portion sizes of the foods that she likes or altering the cooking technique (She does not like to prepare food herself) and this poses an issue in itself as she would be able to have more control of her intake if she did. 1. Very worried initially.  2. I spoke to close and immediate family after blood results confirmed high cholesterol. I was initially screened at a British Health Foundation (BHF) event and they had advised me that I should follow this up by a GP Appointment and a further blood test to confirm. I wanted immediate family to know just to air my concerns and I felt that they should know.
 3. After GP confirmation I went online to do some more research from BHF website and as I am a diabetic I was immediately prescribed statins to reduce cholesterol. However, I was not told about the difference in HDL and Non HDL Cholesterol (It was about 12 years ago) until last year and I had now been advised that 1 has a negating effect on the other and that my total Cholesterol is not as high as was once thought. I am still on statins to control cholesterol and it is thought that I will continue to be so as I am in a high risk group being diabetic.  A letter such as this would have prompted me to book another appointment with my GP unless further information would have been supplied with it. I would want to know what the course of action would be now. What I would have to do/could do to reduce the levels. What would be the consequences if the levels remained high. 1. Quite a few! Clotted Cream, Sausages, Roast Ham Sliced, Bacon, Jaffa Cakes,  Pork Ribs, Meat Balls. 2. Clotted Cream-Had an afternoon tea recently and decided that I want to make some scones to have more at home. Sausages and bacon were added as I wanted to have a full English breakfast at the weekend Ham slices were on special offer as well as ribs/meatballs and Jaffa Cakes were bought for guest. 
3. I did not read any packaging. 4. Felt like I had treated myself 5. For the most part it is a normal weeks shop. Some items that are bought regularly did not need replacing.",Falafel,
262633,Sally,Argyle,argysal@aol.com,"1. I don’t really plan. I buy a mixture of products that I buy every week and then maybe something that’s new in the shop or that I fancy that wek. Sometimes I see things whilst in the shops and impulse buy, as I like trying new things. 
 2. I do write a shopping list for items that I might forget and ones I don’t buy that often. I don’t tend to put items on the list that I buy every week. 
 3. Other family members. I am not just shopping for myself and I always ask them if they want anything apart from the routine shopping. So everyone has an input. I  think I am probably eating more than I was a decade ago. I am also eating more health foods or trendy foods, that wouldn’t have been on my list 10 years ago, like quinoa. I also eat more fruit for breakfast, whereas I would probably just have cereals. I also eat more eggs as I am always reading, that they are good for you, they are a good source of protein and omega 3. A lot of the general foods like roast chicken, pasta, rice etc are the same. I also eat kale now which wouldn’t have been on my list before. I think it is different now due to me being more health conscious now as I get older, but people are more aware of what is good and bad for you. The media push the latest food fads too and I do tend to try them. 
 I don’t think my grocery list will be a lot different in 10 years from now, to what it is at the moment, maybe even healthier, so drop the chocolate and crisps! Or have less of them. I will still try the latest health food too, as I try to do what I can to be healthier, live longer and feel good. I am aware of my cholesterol as we do have a family history of high cholesterol, so I don’t eat really fatty foods and buy a cholesterol lowering margarine. So I will continue buying that. 1. Living a happy, healthy life means to be well and not suffer from illnesses and to also live a lifestyle that prevents illnesses in the future. So by eating nutritious food and a well balanced diet, but I also have to LIVE as well, so that does mean enjoying a bit of chocolate etc.. for the health of my mind, its very pleasurable, which I don'talways get from eating a salad. I try to eat fruit and veg for the antioxidants and the fibre that they give me, which helps my bowels. I am not too strict on calories as I am lucky to be naturally slim, but I also am aware of cholesterol problems, so I don't go silly on fat contents of food. I know I have a family history, so I want to try and help myself to limit problems later in life. Exercise is also an important factor, I try to do yoga, for my muscles, but also to relax me, when its warmer I like to take a walk in the countryside. Being with my family and socialising are part of the mental side, as I feel it's important to keep stimulated by conversations and stop you from being lonely. I also enjoy spending time with my cats, they keep me healthy in mind and spirit! 
 Top 3 things: 
 
 1. Reading Health magazines. I chose this, because I read them regularly, to find out how to follow a healthy lifestyle, I like to read information on nutritional value of food and also, the healthiest foods to eat. So keeping myself knowledgeable is my aim. I get the magazine once a month and read it over the weeks, but if I find an interesting article, I keep it and file it away for future reference. 
 2. Looking at recipes online. I like to do this to get ideas on how to eat healthier. I am not very good at thinking up new recipes and this gives me inspiration and enables me to eat a healthier diet. I look at them a couple of times a month. 
 3. My smoothie maker. I use this to make fruit and veg smoothies. It means, that I can get all my fruit and veg quota in at one time, which is much easier than trying to have at least 5 fruit and veg a day in my meals. At the moment I am not doing them that regularly, but would like to get back into making them more often, maybe at breakfast time, it is just sometimes a hassle getting it out and cleaning it after use. I don't always have the time. Top 3 staples: 
 Bread (Baked in store, 420g, Tiger bread) 
 Milk ( Cravendale, semi-skimmed milk 2 ltr 
 Eggs ( Happy Eggs, 6 box) 
 3 products that I have switched for a healthier alternative: 1. Concentrate juice to fresh juice, I use this everyday, in place of the carton juice. I believe it is healthier and less sugar as it has 50% less sugar, so I think says on the label!  and more fibre in the product. 2. Margarine to Flora Proactiv, I use this all the time on toast, sandwiches. I decided to change this, as I had read an article about in a magazine and also read information from the company themselves about the benefits. 3. Full fat yogurt to Alpro yogurt, I have this most mornings with my breakfast. I decided to try this as I seem to be a bit milk intolerant and I thought that it was lower in fat. I had read about it in magazines and seen a few adverts. 
 I would like to swap more of the sugar I have for sweeteners or sugar alternative like stevia. I am aware of the amount of sugar in a lot of products and keep meaning to cut down on my consumption, but I always seem to put it off to another week. I think it is because I am so used to normal sugar, that I get a bit reluctant to change. Here is my list for things I do to eat healthily Here is my list for things I do to eat healthily 1. I agree, health is a journey. It is a long term commitment. It is not something you can just alter for a a month,e.g. going without alcohol for one month and then going back to your normal drinking afterwards. It should be something that you make an effort to do for the rest of your life. Otherwise you will not see the benefits. 
 2. Cutting down on sugar, Not eating between meals, reducing portion sizes, Not eating as much processed food, Less takeaways. 
 A habit I have successfully adopted is 'Less saturated fat' 
 3. I was looking to lower my cholesterol and just be healthier. At first it was a little difficult, I stopped all microwave meals. I started to look at the packaging on the food I was buying, to see what colour the traffic light symbols for the saturates were. Any red and I didn't buy it. It meant missing out on some of my favourite treats, but I soon got used to the lifestyle. I replaced them with healthier alternatives, either by cooking myself from scratch or swapping them for a lower saturated alternative. The benefits were that when I went for my cholesterol test my blood HDL had improved. Just seeing that my levels had improved made me want to continue and knowing that it is doing me good for the long term. There are quite a lot of options these days, so it has helped me continue plus my mum has adopted this too, so that makes it easier for us as a family. 
 My mum failed to adopt 'Lowering her sugar'. She was planning to cook down on desserts, chocolate and sweets, but it didn't last long and failed miserably! She says she must have a sugar addiction and still had a craving for the sugar and gave into the cravings. I think there is just too much temptation in the supermarkets, when you are you doing your general grocery shopping. 1. I was shocked and surprised after reading the letter, as I felt so well, but pleased that my GP has informed me, so I can take steps to improve it. 
 2. I would tell my close family, who I live with about the letter, in case it was an inherited condition, so that they can go to the GP for a test too, but I would also tell them so that they are aware that I will be changing my diet and that I need their support and help with it. 
 3. I went online to look up information and find out more and see what I could do to help myself. I went on the NHS website and looked on the British Heart Foundation website. I wanted to find out about HDL and non HDL, so I could feel well informed. I also wanted to know what steps I could take to lower my bad cholesterol and improve the good. Also if there were any medications I should be taking and the side effects of them. 
 4. Yes it helped me to decide what my course of action would be. I will be lowering my saturated fat in my diet, do more exercise, eat more fruit and vegetables and look at foods that can improve cholesterol levels like Proactiv margarine, also swap to lower fat cheeses. I would also visit my GP and speak about my diet and discuss other interventions, like statins, if my GP thinks that I might need them, if I can't lower my cholesterol naturally. 1. There were quite a few items that manage to sneak their way into my shopping basket. Which included: 
 Raspberry trifle, Iced tea time buns, spring rolls, quiche, Yorkshire Puddings, Savers butter, Unsmoked bacon, gammon steaks, Mature light cheese, Pork shoulder. 
 2. There were several reasons why I added these to my basket. The pork was on offer, so I decided to choose that over the whole chicken, which wasn't on offer. Some of the other items, I realised that I needed once I was in store, like Yorkshire puddings, cheese, gammon steaks, quiche, bacon and butter. Others I just saw them on the shelf and I fancied them and bought them for other members of the family. 
 3. No I didn't read any of the packing, because I am familiar with the products and the labels, but if I wasn't sure about a product I would look at the fat content and the saturated fats on the label, sometimes I look to see how much sugar an item has in too. 
 4. I just hoped that these items would please the people they were for, as a treat at the end of the week. 
 5. Yes this is a typical week, I always buy more than what is on my shopping list. There is always some temptation once in the store, plus as I walk up and down the aisles, I remember that I need other items, that I forgot to put on my shopping list. It varies slightly from week to week depending on circumstances, such as what I fancy, seen something advertised, something new, fancy a change and also the time of year like Christmas, Easter etc..",Falafel,
262634,Natalie,White,nataliewhite2@hotmail.co.uk,"1 - I tend to plan my meals for the week ahead on Saturday or Sunday, depending on when I'm going shopping.  Sometimes it's a written list, if I'm being super organised, but other times it is a mental list - usually when it's a busy weekend.   2 - Probably depends on what I've had the week before and who I am cooking for that week.  I attend a slimming world group, so it also depends on what we've discussed in group (I go there on a Thursday night).   3 - I cook for my boyfriend and best friend, so I consider them.  When it comes to fruit and veg, I also consider what is in session as it tends to be more widely available. A decade ago, I didn't really cook, I tended to buy things that you took out of the freezer and put in the oven.  Not necessary ready meals, but still convenience foods.  I also didn't have as much disposal cash, so my budget didn't allow for much fresh fruit and vegetables.  Plus, as time has gone on, I've learned more about health and nutrition over the last 10 years.   
 In a decade from now, I hope I am still eating healthily and I have learned more about what is good for you and as trends change, I want to try new things, so hopefully I am still doing this. Enjoying life, spending time with loved ones doing things I enjoy.  Keeping myself fit & healthy going to the gym & eating healthy.   1 - Chicken - an all time favourite.  I love to make a roast dinner on Sunday & use leftover chicken as 'lunch to go' the next day.   2 - Prawns - they are so versatile - you can have them cold for lunch, or eat them warm and add them to a stirfry for dinner. 3.  Mushrooms - great accompaniment for any dish.  They are healthy and can be used for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  My favourite meal is breakfast! Sweet Harvest Chunky Chopped Tomatoes,  400g Ocean Rise Tuna in brine, 160g 
 Stonemill Garlic Granules, 52g I like to watch documentaries regarding food, however i am slightly weary as one minute something is good for you, the next it’s bad for you. My motto is everything in moderation! I like to watch documentaries regarding food, however i am slightly weary as one minute something is good for you, the next it’s bad for you. My motto is everything in moderation! 1.  I agree. Health is something that we should focus on throughout life. What is healthily for you in your younger years is not necessarily healthy for you in your later years. 2. Ensure 1/3 of your plate contains vegetables, staying hydrated, cutting out sugar. 3. Ensure 1/3 of my plate contains vegetables. I was trying to lose weight, introduce more vegetables into my diet. Before this, I didn’t really eat vegetables, not necessarily because i didn’t like the, it was mostly due to cost of fresh veg. Now I will eat most vegetables, in can buy whatever is on offer.  The benefits are my skin is clearer and hair and nails grow now, when they didn’t really before.  I got to the age of 30 until I was successful in managing my weight. I now know that was because I wasn’t fully committed and it wasn’t that important to me.  I think these are the main factors when it comes to being successful.  That said, I think everyone is more aware of health and nutrition these days, probably due to the Intenet and social media. 1. I felt really worried after the reading the letter. 2. I immediately wanted to tell my best friend. She always knows how to calm me down and what to do next. 3. I did want to find out more about cholesterol, however I wouldn’t look on the Internet as it make me worry more. I would go to my doctors to find out more information. I would like to know if I have inherited familial hypercholesterolaemia and what it is.  I would also look at ways of reducing my cholesterol level and maybe change my diet and exercise more. Due to my boyfriend being unwell and needing lots of attention,  I didn’t get chance to do the shopping I had planned.  However i did try and buy some of the things I’d planned.  
 A few snacks and treats found their way into my basket as I was very tired and needed something to lighten my mood (I am an emotional eater, so these things made me feel better).  
 I probably wouldn’t buy them on a normal week, but this was not a normal week.  I try and stick to a shopping list, but this week it was just not possible.",Falafel,
262635,Nazia,Talib,nazia_talib@yahoo.co.uk,"My apologies, as lost access to this page, I worked from memory, I thought you wanted the shopping list categorised by product type not by meal/snack etc. 
 
 
 I will recategorise, and upload and answer the remaining questions now that I have access. 1. I plan my Ocado shopping list by adding products to my basket as I go along. My 3 girls will also go on the app and add their requirements or tell me what to add. I will also check with every family member for any last minute additions. As Aldi don't have a app or online shopping, sadly! I use my calendar and make a note and have a generic list of items saved too if it's a big overdue shop. We tried using a fridge magnet shopping list board but was time consuming and often cause confusion such as the type, brand, flavour or size the item requested by a member of the family. This causes delays and I don't enjoy food shopping so it would get put off until I had clarifation. My family members are very particular and their likes and dislikes change so I try to avoid waste at all costs.  2. We have a lot of staple or regular items that don't change each week besides trying a different brand depending on offers available st the time.  Then on my phone once again, I plan a weekly menu. The menu is made up of 2 requests from each family member and st at least 1 of their choices will be added to the menu. There are 5 us and we eat out 1 day a week and some meals do us for two days. Then I space out the meal requests for 6 days so we get a mixture of protein types so we are not having chicken or rice 3 days in a row.  I also check the school menu for the week and know what they will choose at lunch so avoid cooking something similar for the evening meal.  Our meal plan sometimes stretches over two weeks if I have a lot of requests and to make it fair. My husband works evenings so we have a rule and cook what he wants to eat on his day off and we go out to eat on his second day off.  Meal plan follows a general pattern over 2 weeks; chicken - Parmesan chicken or chicken strips/nuggets Veg curry (alternate beteen 3 dishes) Chicken and veg pasta  Fresh Salmon / Aldi salmon Wellington  Mince chicken or lamb lasagne   lentil curry - alternate between 3 family favourites Roast dinner with chicken with ve Honemade burgers - chicken or lamb Stir fry - alternate sauces and meat Rice dish - alternate between lamb or chicken rice Bolognese Fast box meal kit - alternate between burritos or fajita meal 
 3. I consider every family member, their likes and dislikes, their requests made each week  and the quantity required. My husband trains so we get though a lot of eggs, chicken, milk and cans of tuna. 10years ago my grocery was very different. I only had two girls then my girls will have been very young 
 
 
 I was teaching full time then too so life was very hectic. I didn't cook as much as I do now.

 LESS TAKEAWAYS 'Living a happy, healthy life' to me means; 
 - eating healthy with lots of fruit and veg 
 - low fat diet 
 - low sugar drinks 
 - healthy snacks such as raisins and sugar snaps instead of calorie dense snacks 
 - tuna and chicken help me eat better as it fills me up, gives me the protein I need and stops me snacking after meals. 
 - exercise 3-5 times a week 
 - family time 
 - time without kids or me time too 
 
 
 3 things that allow us to eat healthy are; 
 - saladmaster cooking system (food cooking system so food retains more nutrients and taste!) 
 - 1 cal Sprays instead of oil 
 - make new dishes (especially in the saladmaste) at home so we have less need to eat takeaways. Top 3 staples: 
 Aldi farmhouse loafs thick sliced 
 Eggs 
 Tuna/chicken 
 Aldi Gouda sliced cheese for toasties 
 3 products switched to healthier alternatives:
 
 1. Coke to Coke Zero 
 - changed for Zero sugar rather than diet only drinks which have just as much sweetness in. 
 - have most days with evening meal or if eating out 
 - changed purely for the taste as Coke Zero tastes better than any diet drinks 
 2. Oil to 1 cal spray 
 - daily use 
 - my husband and daughter eat eggs and switched for health reasons (low fat) and prefer the taste as opposed to fried eggs in oil. 
 - bought the 1 cal spray as it was used in the saladmaster demo and also seen on TV. 
 - recommendation. My daughter said to get the olive oil 1 cal spray next time as she thinks it may taste better. 
 3. olive oil fat spread 
 - new change to get healthier 
 - bought olive oil spread from Ocado as it was on offer and cheapest spread and better for you (I think). Also one of my daughters won't use any other brand spread. 
 4. Use saladmaster cookware only 
 - use daily for everything 
 - cooks at 86degree to keep nutrients, cook veg without water or salt so no nutrients lost and veg, lasagne, meat and salmon all taste better in saladmaster than he oven. 
 - bought after demo and hosting party and seeing and tasting the difference in food preparation. 
 
 
 Can't think of any other products to switch was are happy with the current products/brands and lead a fairly healthy lifestyle and try to improve when we can. We are focusing on bigger and healthier breakfasts but had all the ibgriedents at home such as rolled oats to ske Swiss style museli with grated apple and splash of orange juice. 1.  1 sweet thing per day  dentist advice to eat dessert or sugar straight after meal and not in between meals.

If I didn't see it as a destination then I would not be as motivated. When you reach the destination you have to maintain it s o the journey in some ways continues.  Its like a weight loss or diet programmes, we give ourself smaller targets and keep going until you are happy with the weight and size. Then we maintain to keep the weight off. But eventually you will feel I don't want to loose anymore weight-because i have reached my destination.  
 It's definately a lifestyle and once fully adopted and incorporated then it shouldn't feel like a struggle or a journey. For example incorporating 5 a day. 
 
 2. Successful habits I have heard of; 
 Green tea 
 Grapefruit for breakfast Low carb diets Calorie counting  Weight loss programs 
 
 Successfully adopted 
 - dilute cider vinegar for whiter teeth, lowers cholesterol, aids digestion and much more. Taste isn't the best but try to have it a few times a week. Getting white teeth and loosing weight has helped motivate me to do this. 
 - 1 cal spray for frying eggs. I don't eat eggs but adopted for the rest of the family. Challenge: eggs stick to pan unlike when using oil but with a lot of practice, all the family prefer less greasy eggs and better texture so has been easy to maintain. 
 - diet Coke to Coke Zero, tastes better and like it says zero sugar so has been easy to adapt for the whole family. 
 - cooking vegetables properly without loosing nutrients. Challenge-can only cook with saladmaster; veg without water and salt or any honey/butter and still taste good. Benefits, Saladmaster set was expensive but life time investment and food tastes better and healthier and we have cut back on oil and salt and eat out less. Also eating more salads and vegetables. Challenge having all the veg in and using up whilst fresh. Buy only what we need for the week and menu plan has helped maintain this. If all fails I use the veg up to make stir fries.  - sweet potato fries in the oven rather than conventional fries fries. No challenges faced. Benefits- less starch and no frying so less fat and carbs from ordinary potatoes. Challenge- family prefer certain brands of sweet potato fries  Aviko sweet potato fries only available on Ocado. I was worried and concerned of it being over the ideal levels and how it could carry on increasing without changes. I had thoughts of how to reduce cholesterol ran through my head. 
 I didnt immediately tell anyone, if I told my husband or children they would worry so I would try rectify the problem so they don't need to know. I would not want the pressure and concern from them on a daily basis.  I smoke but don't drink and try to exercise a few times a week. So I would at this stage increase exercise, reduce smoking and have more cholesterol lowering products and make changes to the way food it cooked. Luckily the salad master helps in this department as you cook without oil.  I also went online and found lots of reliable and valid websites from nhs to cholesterol specialist sites. I found lots of ideas on how to reduce cholesterol levels as well as the direct and associated risks of cholesterol. I only read packaging for new products we try. We are familiar with the contents for what we buy regular. So I did not read any packing for this weeks shop. 
 This was not a normal week as I spent more on food shopping with kids off school and 3 neices over.  
 Also stocked up on food items from Morrisons with the 20% discount offer and especially salamon for £5kg instead of £12-20/kg. 
 A typical week I would have spent less as kids at school. Also I spent more with promotions and massive savings at morrisons. However the products generally remained the same with the exception of a few sweets.",Falafel,
262653,Richard,Moore,richard.moore7777@googlemail.com,"we plan a weekly shop, with top up shops every few days as well. 
 There are the things we buy often and every week. 
 Also we try and vary our meals etc to keep things interesting. 
 But also firm favorites too. 
 We are a family of five so there are lots of mouths to feed. We tend to buy in bulk where possible. And obviously look for deals and bargains. We like good quality food and dont mind paying extra for it too. The kids are quite fussy so its hard to choose stuff for them. 
 Hope i answered this correctly. And do you want an actual shopping list type of post? Massive changes. 10 years ago i spent very little compared to what i spend now. We buy better quality foods now and put more time and effect into buying and making food. 
 Things i would of written then would be more boring, not as varied, and probably not as healthy as now. We probqbly spend 10 times more now than we did ten years ago, plus we have kids now too. Also i bought more super market btands then as a way of saving money where as now there are some brands which i dont mind paying extra for. Thanks. 1. I try to eat healthy foods as much as possible, but of course some foods that i like may not be healthy. 
 I eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads etc, and i feel this is a good way of eating healthy. 
 I do a lot of walking, as i live in the city, and i don't drive, so we practically walk every where, and i feel that is a good way of doing exercise. 
 I feel i could definitely do more, but i haven't stepped up my game yet. I know that things like ""diets"" are probably in the pipe line for the future, but i haven't faced up to doing them just yet. Here are a series of photos showing a few staples, and others, see description. Over time during my life i have picked up various sources of information about good foods to eat for vitamins and nutrition. through people/online etc and i feel i can trust most of that info, as its based on credible evidence. Over time during my life i have picked up various sources of information about good foods to eat for vitamins and nutrition. through people/online etc and i feel i can trust most of that info, as its based on credible evidence. 1. Its definitely a journey, one that gets harder as we go along, i feel the body is more demanding in its needs, and less forgiving if these needs are not met. 2. Exercise regularly, whether big or small, it keeps the body moving so to speak. 3. To at least do some, even if its a small amount. 4. I hate gyms, so finding ways to exercise other ways. 5. Benefits are the body needs at least some exercise to keep everything healthy. 6. I find it fairly easy as i don't drive, so i walk every where, sometimes many miles, so its just be doing what i normally do, but exercising at the same time. 7. Diets, i am not saying they are a bad thing, but many times people take on a diet only to fail, its like setting yourself unrealistic challenges, and the chances of failing are very high.
Better to set more achievable targets that can be met. 1. A little concerned, what is this medicine they want to give me? 
 Is it safe....? In the letter it said ""i am glad you are feeling well and healthy"" then delivers the news you are obviously not well at all. Maybe could of been said differently 
 
 2. Well obviously my wife, and she will probably say i need to get a better diet etc. 
 3. Not sure i would go on a random look online, i would be more interested in the proposed medication, and what is that all about. 
 4. i would probably seek some information, maybe through an official NHS site though 1. Yes, junk food you could say, naughty stuff. 
 2. well we always have a core list of items we get, but of course it would be boring to always get the same and never any treats. 
 3. Not really, we go for certain brands when purchasing certain foods, but not for everything. 
 4. just some extra treats 
 5. fairly normal, we do get stuck on what meals me and my wife should have, so we sometimes get top up shops during the week, for different bits for our dinner. We could definitely do with out buying junk food, but we do purchase these things too.",Falafel,

 I don’t eat Fats or Oils 1/I am personally very interested in New Products,Diets,Foods & Superfoods that are being discovered or found to be good for us as I have become more aware as I have got older that my health & lifestyle could be affected so it’s now a journey that will always change then evolve. 2/Excercise & Diet are the main that I’m aware of but I also take the right medications for genetic issues in my Family history. 3/I’m hoping to achieve a healthy lifestyle control of my weight & so I can live o long healthy life. 4/The challenges are being strong willed & able to maintain the diet along with exercise & diet that I must follow. 5/The benefits are more energy & sleeping well while feeling good about yourself. 6/I am strict in my food shopping & not binging on things that I should not eat with little snacking. 
 I have seen people in my friends & family that have died young due to unhealthy lifestyles I was diagnosed with High Cholesterol at 30 years of age during an annual check up at that time I was very fit & healthy going to workout 3-4 times a week for many years.After many tests change in Diet it was decided that Statins would be needed it’s now 25 years later & all my levels are normal but dosage has increased over the years with age.I also learned about the disease & what I should do to control it further for the rest of my life if I didn’t want to have heart problems as I got older but unfortunately the High Blood Pressure with Type 2 Dibetes followed which was unfortunate due to personal problems & weight gain but now I have got back on track after the research study in 2016 & now I don’t have the Diebetes but I do have hereditary High Blood Pressure 1/Yes I do sometimes have issues with picking up items that I shouldn’t usually during holiday times or moments of depression. 2/As I have stated I have moments of stress or depression I can have weak moments of failure but usually these times are far & few between. 3/I usually look at fat content & sugars to try to avoid the bad things but sometimes I don’t want to look or know about it during times of weaknes. 4/It’s a comfort thing which you think will make you feel better but usually makes you feel worse. 5/This is not a Normal Week it’s occasional as I have mentioned & most of the time I am controlled & stick to my Diet with Routine.",Falafel,
262655,Honey,Perring,honeyperring@gmail.com,"I tend to buy for that day and the following day only, but as breakfast is my favourite meal i always plan ahead. 
 i like to stock up ahead on tinned chick peas, tomatoes etc as cupboard basics. I make sure i have a mix of usual basics of protein and a mixture of vegetables, rice, sweet potato so i can make curries or roast vegetables. So usually o list those to just to remember. i usually have everything on the list.  Some every day basics like coffee and milk i buy less often and as needed. i buy for myself only. Before I ate more processed food, dairy, meat and sugary foods. My ex partner liked these kind of foods so with someone else in the choice it influenced my diet. I never ate junk food. I made similar things but ate meat, chocolate eclairs and biscuits. I ate about the same amounts though at any meal.  
 I think it might be similar and more high protein and good carbohydrate combinations. With herbs and spices for optimum health and healing as everyday choices. specialised not nutrients and ageing process. more of what my body needs than to satisfy taste and palette. try not be stressed or angry. feel motivated. walk in park and i love to do dog sitting also. eating well. i do not drink alcohol or smoke, or eat meat. i think nutrition is key  and i want to be healthy and pain/illness free. i love to dance and swim in the sea, i am also a DJ and love yoga, 
 sunshine is very important and any activities like swimming walkingand yoga outsode 
 
 
 fruit and veg and tasty spicy foods are my favorite. 
 
 
 proteins as beans, good carbohydrates and coconut milk remind me of sunny holiday times and healthy living i bought dried lentils instead of potatoes but didn't really know how to cook, soak etc so saw these prepared lentils and now use those as quick convenient and tasty. 
 i use instead of potatoes. 1-2 times a week. 
 caught my eye when looking for something else. 
 
 
 chick peas taste ""meaty"" and are filling. its an ideal source of protein for me as i don't eat meat. i love the taste and are filling. i eat straight from the can when i open and am preparing something as so lovely. 
 1-2 times a week. 
 cheap. no additives. sometimes i buy the organic ones but these are only 40p 
 
 
 coconut milk, i buy the one without any additives so its clean tasting, not 'jelly like' as some of the ones with lots of added things are. 
 very tasty and transforms any meal. reminds me of thailand. nutritional. 
 
 
 i wouldn't swap ANY !!! almond milk   -   dairy started to taste bad in my mouth and i actually stopped drinking coffee for 6 months. i drank an almond milk coffee at an hotel on holiday and tasted amazing. i never went back to dairy. now i see shelves full of milk alternatives in the supermarket. so its an easy choice. i also do not agree with farming techniques used in UK from research on FB and youtube fresh veg - learning from magazines and vlogs that dark leafy veg is very good for me. so i chose carefully. my mum also mentioned it to me last week. chickpea coconut curry - i googled for a chickpea curry recipe, and found an amazing website called ""Yup its vegan"". the recipe was so delicious i have since made it many times for myself and friends. so i am confident the other recipes will be good lemons - warm lemon water in the morning. my mum told me to do this since a child. and my hairdresser also told me the other day. i have now been doing it while i make my morning coffee. FB. healthy living vlogs and blogs. basmati rice/sweet potato - i prefer rice and SP to potatoes as i think its better than the starchy taste and has more nutrition. Blogs i read about recipes highlighted them. and basmati tastier than plain boiled long rice. 
 i trust vlogs and blogs and magazine articles as long as they do not promote supermarket processed items. almond milk   -   dairy started to taste bad in my mouth and i actually stopped drinking coffee for 6 months. i drank an almond milk coffee at an hotel on holiday and tasted amazing. i never went back to dairy. now i see shelves full of milk alternatives in the supermarket. so its an easy choice. i also do not agree with farming techniques used in UK from research on FB and youtube fresh veg - learning from magazines and vlogs that dark leafy veg is very good for me. so i chose carefully. my mum also mentioned it to me last week. chickpea coconut curry - i googled for a chickpea curry recipe, and found an amazing website called ""Yup its vegan"". the recipe was so delicious i have since made it many times for myself and friends. so i am confident the other recipes will be good lemons - warm lemon water in the morning. my mum told me to do this since a child. and my hairdresser also told me the other day. i have now been doing it while i make my morning coffee.

 i trust vlogs and blogs and magazine articles as long as they do not promote supermarket processed items. 1 - yes i agree. its ongoing and your tastes can also change, as well as habits and environment. 2 - lemon water in the morning. protein from beans and pulses. smoothies - i have a mini blender and is very convenient for whizzing fresh orange juice and nutritional supplements like macca and pollen 3 optimum health 4 adopting a new habit and remembering to do it. but i try to make it quick and convenient and not be lazy 5 including supplements and new foods, eg fresh beetroot 
 i don't think have failed at any, but would like to make more new recipes not very happy. pessimistic. felt like i had done the damage already and nothing can help. doom and gloom 
 i wouldn't tell anyone 
 i would google ""natural treatment/ life changes"" for high cholesterol, seek info from youtube videos about how to combat naturally. vlogs about changes to reduce it. high impacting foods. 
 
 
 i would adopt changes quickly i think. 2 months ago i stopped smoking overnight and wish i had done it sooner. Will power is key. pointers for info are necessary and ways to be inventive. i would want to reduce it and not have the attitude of nothing can be done about it. my mum and aunt had breast cancer so healthy living and eating is really important to me. i was given some mini Easter eggs from my mum. but was not eating chocolate anymore! i have been eating them tonight... 
 i bought some organic bread i like toast in the morning not sure if was on my list though.  i check ingredients for least additives. i went to a second supermarket as the first supermarket only had coconut milk with emulsifiers in it 
 
 
 TASTE Nutrition. prefer to eat things good for me than feel full. 
 yes was a normal week. i had sushi last night, but today had a bad stomach, which isn't usual. i prefer my own food for taste.",Falafel,
322902,Chuchu,Huang,373034268@qq.com,"1. colourful：the flask looks really colourful in the series ，youthful: because of the colour, and the ads, i see it more as a brand for young people. don't really think older generation would be into this , trendy: i really like some special bottles with pictures. Also because you have other clothes and accessary products 2.Price in china, where can i get, can i DIY my own? who will be Chinese ambassador? I forgot to mention people don't really carry flask to beach! In third pic, it reminds me that i go to hiking with my friends in my backpack, carry my flask to keep hydrated. I went to Huangshang last year for hiking, it was very nice. Although there is no snow mountain. Youthful: this position it's usually done by young couple. Very energetic. although chinese couple dont really do this, we are more cenversavitive with showing emotion or body attach in public place beach: they are near beach, feel like it's more a beach lifestyle. young love: it shows a kind of young love bird feeling, go on a date near the beach 3. happy, cheerful, not care about the environment (if it's in a Chinese setting), sexy 1. fashion : this couple are sitting in an air balloon sofa? i dont really see people do this much, so it's quite trendy/ fashion way for young kids. They both wear sunglasses, probably to show off their style is more important than actual go swim haha:grin: 2. chilled: they look happy and chilled under the su 3. festive - remind me more of a festival near the beach 4. cheerful, should be full of people around them, young vibe, probably celebrate for sth, for fun Hard working: feel like they have walked miles and reach a point admiring the great nature Thoughtful: maybe they are thinking about strength and life  nature: love the nature in the picture, that's where you get the greatest power 3. i feel people have a tough heart, good will, to achieve this point. and want to share the beauty of nature with their comrade. This is what i really like:) Chinese youth like to work hard and enjoy the fruit!! chilled: they look relaxed, more like a country side walk, not backpack. enjoy the nature nature: they try to get close to the nature and enjoy it. appreciate what's given by the nature, which is very good happy: they smile:stuck_out_tongue: It looks like a very happy, chilled picture, people are relaxed and enjoy themselves with the nature, maybe ready to go back home, it's looks like afternoon time 1. they can keep cool drink cool. The flask is good for people to take for fun. The flask can be fun in itself. Benefit to me would be: make me look like a young, fun, energetic person to have the flask. 2. i love this message. You can bring this flask for your adventure, it will keep you accompany and achieve your goal with you. I feel i can grow attachement with my flask if i take it with me for jorney 1. i don't really relate to the first picture. Chinese people really don't take flask with them to beach, that's considered a bit old fashion, going to beach, we usually have nice drinks, bubble tea, ice cream, beers.... so i might just change this idea. However, the message itself is quite good, might be better put into another situation - for example, travel in a old town etc.  in chinese is: 一天趣味，尽在hydro flask 2. i love this! the idea is to travel, to explore, to move with your flask. This is the real function of it, good to environment, also meaningful to have the flask as a company to explore with you. I won't change it. Feel very relevant. 带上杯子，一同去探险！ 1. it trying to say that the bottle can keep the liquid in a perfect temperature - the original temperature when it's pull in. So that's the main goal that i hope the flask can achieve basically. and it can last 24h - all day. 2. It's saying wherever you go, the flask will keep the temperature the say, implicating even in tuff locations - very cold or hot, the temperature inside the flask will be the same. So it's helpful to people who do extreme sport or people live in cold/hot weather. This i relate to less. 1. Big idea: keep the temperature as it is all day. With the picture, you can have it for a whole day. I don't relate to this... not very real. People like them should have cocktail instead of a flask... don't look cool and we really don't carry flask in this situation, to have fun with friends...This is too commercial..:pleading_face: nothing wrong with the message, it's more about the picture. 一整天，给你完美温度。 2. Big idea: wherever you go, the temperature will be perfect, keep great:) Not a bad idea, i feel related to the picture as well. I can imagine people, family go hiking or go to nature, carry flask. nice message as well.走到哪里，都是完美的温度。 1. mean's let's start, let's go to somewhere, together with the icon, looks like let's do exercise, sport, hiking... 2.Go travel:) Usually it's abroad. We will take flight. Once we get there, we will take a lot photos, explore local city and communicate with locals if we can. Travel with Flask will be a great idea. I will feel energised! 1. ummmm if use in China, i would suggest to use asian model, chinese mountain. Wearing long trousers. People would feel more conected when they see the scene is more real The written bit is quite good.  2.emphasise many they get to the mountain top - achieve to a point after hard work -that's relate to our culture emphasise on success 3. the modle, the background - should change to chinese setting 4. use chinese model and mountain, e.g. huang mountain 5. nothing else apart from what i mentioned Hydro flask has really great colour session! The bottle looks very trendy and can keep warm for 12h. Let's go for it!",Dragon,

334311,Emmanuel,Peype,emmanuel.peype@gmail.com,"1. The three words I choose are outdoor, friendly and responsible The rationale behind my selection is as follows - Outdoor: visuals refer a lot to outdoor activities and the word 'adventure' reinforces the willingness of being identified as a sport/adventurous brand. - Friendly: group activities which would ignite the fact Hydro Flask is a brand that you share between friends, that gathers people during offline activities. - Responsible: some of the messaging on the website tends to position HF as a responsible brand, who cares about the environment and social causes.  
 2. from this, I would like to know more about Hydro Flask products and how they differ from the competition I'm living in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province a few steps away from HK. In this region, hiking is among one of the most accessible outdoor activities. There are a lot of people whotend to go hiking every weekend, whether they are chinese or foreigner. There are actually group activities and I see this visual reflecting a lot with this part of China 1. Summer, fun and chill 2.  - Summer: action taking place on a beach, people wearing bath suits  - Fun: people smiling and laughing - Chill: overall, the environment looks quiet and chill. 3. The mood is full of good vibes. Sea and Sun :smiley: 1. Fun, beach and relaxation 2. - Fun: people smiling on the picture  - beach: the action takes place on a beach - relaxation: it feels like a very relaxed place 3. the atmosphere is very chilled 1. Nature, Relief and Achievement 2. - Nature: they practice hiking and environment is more focused on nature than the other ones. - Relief: they seemed pretty relieved following their hikes - Achievement: their facial expressions show a certain sense of achievement, the satisfaction of having surpassed themselves 3. A feeling of satisfaction 1. Sunset, leisure, Positive mood 2. -Sunset: it refers to the moment of the day - Leisure: the scene doesn't look like a very active sport session - Positive mood: it feels that they are reaching to the top of a hill, a mix of satisfaction and achievement.  3. The atmosphere is very chilled 1. Hydro Flask is trying to say that its products help provide users with a lot of fun/interesting experiences. 2. The contenance of its water bottle 1. Promote the fact the wattle bottle keeps liquid either hot or cold, for longer than other bottles. Feel relevant in the context of hiking and outdoor activities. One thing about China is the fact people drink a lot of hot water, both during hot and cold weathers as it is believed to be good for your body. The form of the tagline works well, as in China, tagline needs to be memorable and convey the user benefits 2. Could be more straightforward so could link user benefits in a single image. A day's hot water in every Hydro Flask. Keep your water colder with Hydro Flask.  1. it is trying to explain that the product keeps your water at the perfect temperature, whatever the number of hours you keep it. 2. Same, but emphasizing that whatever the adventure is, Hydro Flask will keep your water hot or cold longer. 1. The big idea consists of showing that Hydro Flask keeps your water hot or cold whatever the time you spend on the beach. It could be relevant indeed, as keeping water at the right temperature is difficult 2. Perfect Temperature. Wherever you go. 1. It means 'let's begin the adventure' 2. a. I;'m going because it will be fun with him b. Going to the beach c. I will take a cab and then go by hike d. Go swimming  e. Pretty good.

However, with its current logo and imagery, it looks like the brand tries to target different audience segments.",Dragon,

The benefit to me is an encouragement to face life. 1. I think the big idea is about braveness and life meaning. Yes I do. 2. Accompany you to face every adventure of your life.

324014,Man,Yuan,amandine@madscience-cn.com,"1. Convinience——According to its website, the brand's products range from the most popular bottles to clothes and backpacks. Presumably this brand has brought great convenience to many people's lives. Colorful——The product design of Hydro Flask is very colorful, the first impression of the website is very lively and comfortable. For me, I like colorful things, it makes me feel life is very bright and pleasant. Longer——One of the important messages the website wants to convey to visitors is that the product will last a long time in terms of temperature, at least that's the most important message I've read and impressed. 2. I'm sure Hydro Flask is great at reusable bottles, but the first question I wanted to know was how long the temperature would last, and seeing so many other products made me wonder what the brand's next product would be. The hat and cup in the picture remind me that during the National Day holiday, we went to a mountain called sanqing mountain in jiangxi province, China.We climbed for six hours and it was so hot that we ran out of water, and the water on the mountain was 10 yuan per bottle (the normal price is around 2 yuan). But the water from the fridge is really delicious, very cool and thirst quenching. The picture shows them sitting on the Inflatable chair , which reminds me of a year I spent vacation in Bali, where the villa had a swimming pool and was next to the sea. We traveled as a family, playing with water every day on a flowating chair in the pool. 1. Hot, lovebirds, vacation. 2. The ultraviolet ray is intense at beach generally, and the sunlight is very good, therefore pople will feel quite hot. The couple's actions in the photo make it seem like they just fell in love and are on vacation. 3. This picture gives people the feeling of youth, love, relaxation, beach, vacation. The color of the environment is weakened in order to reflect the color of the product and the clothes of the model. However, there is a large area of white space, which makes me pay attention to the product and think about the possibility of such situation happening in the real world. After all, as I said, I did not see people wearing vacuum cups on the beach. But I think this photo may be more appealing to people in their early 20s. 1. Comfortable, healthy and fashion 2. This is the picture I chose. The place where they sat was comfortable, and their skin color showed that they had a healthy lifestyle. The water cup was more like a part of this healthy lifestyle, and it fit in the picture. Their style makes me feel more fashionable. 3. The two seem to be both omniscient friends and a couple who follow a healthy diet and exercise routine because they take their bodies and health seriously. They enjoy life in addition to their normal working life. The environment is not important at this time, what is important is that they know what they like and need. 1. Hiking, nature and immersion. 2.The two people in the picture, dressed lightly and warm, take a break after a hike to drink water and immerse theirselves in the beauty of nature. 3.  The surrounding scenery makes people feel natural and relaxed, and drinking water in such an environment is also a very pleasant enjoyment! 1. Warm, outskirt, recreation. 2. The two people in the picture give me a warm feeling of family, I think they are walking and relaxing not far from their suburban home, away from the noise of the city. 3.  Enjoy nature and relaxation with your family during a rare vacation. According to their shoes, it was just a relaxing walk, maybe just a hill not far from the city. 1. Through these photos, HydroFlask wants to tell us that its products are applicable to many different situations in life, and more importantly, it can reflect a healthy and environmentally friendly lifestyle, whether on the road, on vacation, or at rest, we can feel the colorful and healthy happiness of the world through HydroFlask products. 
 2.  There are so many benefits, I am very much in favor of a healthy and environmentally friendly lifestyle. The picture shows that HydroFlask can give you different pleasure and satisfaction in different situations, and the benefits for me is that I can prepare ahead of time in different travel plans, reducing unnecessary trouble and inconvenience. 1. It is how you live your life. You can make it full of adventure and imagination, or you can make it full of happiness and laughter, and sometimes this can be achieved by choosing some of the things in life that can bring you a little happiness. It is relevant to me, most people want to live better and better, more and more convenient, of course, we hope that there are some things that can bring us closer to the ideal life. 
 2. Relax the fatigue of the journey and enjoy the gift of nature. 舒缓旅途的疲惫， 尽享自然的 馈赠。 No matter how beautiful the scenery is, It can't be more more beautiful than your comfortable smile. Hope Hydro Flask can bring you more happiness! 风景再美，美不过你舒心的笑容。愿Hydro Flask能带给你更多快乐！ HydroFlask: Witness the highlights of your life! Hydro Flask见证你生命中的高光时刻！ 1. Hydro Flask is trying to say it can keep the perfect temperature for you at anytime and anywhere, and it can last all day. It has excellent insulation effect and it is easy to carry. 
 2. If I want to go hiking, which is usually all day, if my water temperature can be maintained all day, it will be perfect. I assume it would be light, and the hook on the cap would be portable, so it would be handy for people who already carry heavy load. 1. It is the length of time the temperature can be maintained. Of course it is relevant to me, because we accept room temperature water most of the time since we don't have many options. 
   2. Prefect temperature for perfect time. 完美水温，随时畅饮。 
  It is eco-friendly and colorful, and the temperature is what you want. 环保多彩，冷热随心。 1. To explore the unknown world together, to go to a new place or field together, to start doing something together. 2. a. Because we need something new for life, and it is always fun to be with your best friend. b.   I want to travel to Asian countries with my good friends, Japan or Cambodia. c. Airplane d. Do what you want to do, experience different city cultures, sightseeing and shopping, enjoy the time with good friend! e. I think I'll be excited to go somewhere new and do something new! The immediate message from the pictures and written message was that it would keep the temperature for a long time and that we could use the HydroFlask on our hike. But how does it help us to go outside and enjoy a happy and active life? How does it reflect the right temperature to help us? I hope to see these in pictures or videos, so that we can more intuitively understand what HydroFlask can bring us and what the value is? I may change the color of the water cup and the color of the scenery, and make the color consistent between the water cup and the scenery, so that the audience can understand that the design of the water cup color is taken from nature, which is also one of the concepts of HydroFlask, hope people can go outside more. I will also show pictures or videos of models wearing short sleeves when climbing mountains, drinking ice water when it is very hot, or drinking hot water when climbing or hiking in snow (Asian models may be needed to reflect hot water). 
 As for the embodiment of temperature maintain time, if it is video production, I will choose the sunrise in the morning and the night scene in the dark at night to show the fatigue of travelers throughout the day, at this time the emergence of a cup of hot water or ice water can reflect not only the great function of Hydro Flask bottle, but also its necessity in our life. Hi Morna! I found a very popular cup in foreign countries, it can keep hot water for 12 hours, cold water  for 24 hours, isn't it amazing?! I feel that it can compete with the popular Japanese thermos cup. And the appearance is just beautiful, there are many beautiful colors to choose and I can design my own!",Dragon,

It'd like to know the weight of the products since I don't like my bag being heavy, also want to know the pricing in China, if its expensive. It reminds me the hiking tour I organized last summer in Taiwan, we spent 4 days to hike a mountain with height of 3300 altitude. We also stayed on the mountain for camping and spend 6-10 hours for hiking everyday. It's the first time I bought water bottle because the guide asked us to carry bottle with at least 1 litre volume 1. bright, energetic and hot  2. its the feeling associate with the beach and the posture & energy that the models express 3. its fun and full of energy, also happy and enjoying their time 1. cozy, sunshine & comfortable 2. The models sit so comfortable and easy, and they're in swim wear reminds me the sun & hot weather 3. it's calm and cozy, just being relaxing 1. relaxed, cool & nature 2. from the facial expression of the models, they're calm and relaxed after hiking for a while, the nature is nice on this picture too. Their outfit proves that the temperature is cold. 3. calm and relaxed 1. easy, fun and warm 2. the facial expression of the models show that they're easy with the small walk, they wear slipper too which mean its only a short walk. The sun behind gave me feeling of warm and bright. 3. Fun and relaxed 1. Hydro flask is fun and adventours, it can be used whole day and all types of bottle can bring you this feelings 2. Personally I don't need a bottle for full day and just go to whole day nature tour for few times every year, it doesn't fit me that much...I'd need bottle for my gym and office hourly more. Light and handy for daily life use to save plastic bottle would be good for me 1. 24 hours cold and 12 hours hot sound good, I need to keep my drink hot because I drink hot drink most of the time. But I don't need to keep drink cold for 24 hours and it's not good to drink cold drink during sports too, which is not good for health. 2. Half day hot. Full day cold.  半天熱 全天冷  
 冷熱皆能  (I'm a copyrighter, above is my suggested tag) 1. Hydro Flask can keep perfect temperature, no matter where is it and when it is. 2. it's about the long lasting of the function, mean the product is stable. To me, I don't have that much requirement  of temperature, it's not that relevant to me 1. its quite similar with the question with video before...the hot temperature is relevant to me, all day and anywhere is good idea too 2. my suggestion would be the same as last time since the main tag is about the time length of keeping the temperature 1. it means moving to me, driving me to go outside and outdoor 2. a. go gathering or tour with friends b. go to the park or grassland for picnic c. by public transportation d. placing the picnic mat and lay on the grassland, also taking out drinks and food e. relaxing, cozy and fun, enjoyable moments with friends  I'd tell Hydro Flask is a focus on the temperature of drink with long lasting function for keeping both cold & hot temperature which is good for outdoor activities.",Dragon,ENFP
230603,Susan,Schell,susankristinaschell@gmail.com,"   When looking for non-dairy alternatives to milk I tend to lean more towards oat milks that foam really well (Oatly barista edition) because I am seeking that ""real"" milk-like experience while drinking coffee. For baking or making breakfast, I am happy to use almond milks. I look for almond milks with not too much sugar and a more subtle almond flavor, I sometimes find that they can taste a bit too almond-y or weirdly sweet for my liking (but again this is mostly for drinks, if I'm just adding the milk to overnight oats or something, I don't mind the almond flavor being pronounced.) 

I would definitely take notice of an almond barista blend milk - something that is designed especially for making milk foam for lattes, matcha drinks, and so on. This would highlight the thicker consistency of the product to me and make me assume it is creamier than a regular almond milk, which I would be eager to try! I think the packaging is very important to me, I would want this to really stand out from the regular almond milks so I don't accidentally grab the wrong one. Oatly does a good job of this because the barista blend is a completely different color from their normal oat milks. I think it should be emphasized that the product is going to foam up like it was made in a cafe and work really well in a hot beverage. I am a sucker for cute packaging, it really grabs my attention...so if it looks good, I am more inclined to go for the nicely designed bottle or box when first trying out a product. I also like when the packaging really emphasizes that it is vegan, non-dairy, and is just clear and easy to understand. 1. I particularly identify with the ""Why would I be interested?"" section - plant based milks can indeed be too thin or sometimes watery. They often are totally lacking a thick and creamy texture. I truly don't miss regular milk when I have a solid plant based substitute, but these are tricky to find - I've really only been completely satisfied with Oatly's Barista Edition, but it is actually hard to come by in supermarkets here in France, so I often end up buying other brands of less satisfying plant based milks when I can't find what I want. So I really understood and related to this first section.

I think the ""we won't miss normal dairy milk"" is great because if this really is a comparable product, I think it is quite true. The emphasis on ""Thicker"" and ""Creamier"" stood out to me and makes me want to try the product to see if it would work well for me. I was also excited by and curious about the flavor options, I would probably try the Creamy Original and Creamy Vanilla as I find those the most compelling options. But I think it is appealing to the customer to have a few options to try so they can find what works best for them.  

2. I personally am not impacted by these being ""straight from our California orchards"" - that doesn't really resonate with me or mean that I think these are somehow better almonds and thus a better product. I am fairly neutral towards that statement as it doesn't strike me as implying much about the brand other than the fact that the almonds come from California. It doesn't give me a sense that brand is trying to be accountable and make good ecological choices or take care of their employees or their environmental impact. It feels like this phrase is sort of thrown in there to give a hint of this notion of ""caring"" and makes it seem like a conscious choice to only use California almonds but I feel like it falls a bit short or doesn't actually mean much to the consumer other than it perhaps tells a bit of the brand's history.

I think the idea of saying it is ""wholesome"" is actually quite smart in marketing it as real replacement for regular milk. I believe this contributes to the emphasis on how little the customer might miss normal milk after finding a good replacement product. It is also like giving the customers that same sort of nostalgic / wholesome / quotidian ""milk"" experience that people grew up having and will let their children have as well -  which aligns well with the ""whole family can enjoy"" bit.

Personally, I think it could mention being vegan or plant based in the product description. Like ""This thicker, creamier almond milk is 100% vegan and is so deliciously wholesome that the whole family can enjoy."" Since I don't have children, I do feel a bit odd picking option 3; however, I strongly related to the phrase about ""becoming more conscious about what I feed myself"" and that I ""am trying to encourage a more plant based lifestyle to support our overall health."" I am in the process of becoming more and more vegetarian / vegan. This felt the most relevant to my diet and current approach towards what I am eating and drinking. It is kind of funny because I do also relate a bit to the ""non dairy milks aren't rich and creamy enough for my kids"" because my boyfriend actually prefers to use the Oatly Barista Edition milk (that I buy specifically for making nice lattes or hot drinks) in his cereal because it tastes better, is thicker, and is creamier. This hit home for me, except that its my boyfriend instead of my children complaining about the taste of some non-dairy milks. 

I especially got excited about the line where it says ""a rich and creamy taste that's consistent with whole dairy milk"" because that is EXACTLY what I am searching for when looking for non-dairy milks. ""Consistent"" is a great word here! I want the right consistency and I want it to be comparable to regular milk in texture and taste. I want it to truly replace whole milk in my life and to act/perform like normal milk would. This line sounded really good to me, it absolutely sells what I am looking for. I feel like I have mentioned this a lot now but I am firmly on team Oatly Barista Edition! I am obsessed with it because it foams perfectly in my Aeroccino milk frother. It works like an oat milk in a real cafe would foam up, so it is just perfect in coffee lattes and matcha lattes. It tastes great and works wonderfully. I have tried the non Barista Edition oat milks from the same brand and I am not a fan, they are watery and lack creaminess but above all I just don't like the flavor. But the Barista Edition really is perfection, it is an absolute home run and I stock up on it whenever I find it because I love it so much and its hard to find in France. My main goal is always finding a non-dairy milk that will work well in my coffee - I don't love a strong almond or soy taste in coffee so that is why I lean more towards oat milk lattes. 

I don't think we've gotten to the packaging yet but I do still strongly believe that this is a huge factor in my choice making at the supermarket. Packaging always draws my attention and I appreciate the details of good design - like is easy and convenient to use, is it easily recycled, does it look nice, etc.                      2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,ESFP
225801,Jeanie,Demoss,jsheyngis3@yahoo.com,"1. What made me really notice is the dairy free, no added sugar, developed along side nutritionist. 
2.  I think the concept can be improved by knowing that it can be with or without mtc oil. For me, coconut oil would be a lot more appealing and would even improve the taste, unlike mtc oil. I would also find it appealing to know how much of it is my daily intake? I do not love the word enriched. Maybe saying enhanced or supported would make it better. I also don’t love the word developed because it sounds too man made. Maybe saying inspired for athletes and healthy diets would be much better than developed. Everything else is spot on! 1. Keto friendly 
2. Carb free 
3. No added sugar I want to say it would also be nice to have an option for honey as a sweeter flavor or coconut. 

I’ve seen nut dips that taste creamy and don’t have too much or a nutty taste. Those are really good for my dip cravings and really taste like the real thing.                          2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
334671,Emily,Bache,ebache3@gmail.com,"The fact that this has been developed along side nutritionist is definitely something that caught my eye. I almost don't trust myself to determine if something is keto or not. This makes me think of the haribo gummy bear fiasco. They said low-sugar so most people assumed it would be good for themselves. It turned out that it gave you horrible stomach pains. (You should look at the reviews on Amazon, it's actually very funny.) But, if I had seen a bag of low-sugar gummy bears I would assume I was making a good decision. If a nutritionist had seen the ingredients in that package though, they would have assured the consumer that they were in fact a terrible idea. I think the fact that it is created along side nutritionists is a comforting and reassuring tool for the consumer. 

I would make it a little shorter and sweeter. Maybe like created and approved by nutritionists! If it's a lot of information I probably won't read it on a package. It needs to be super short. 1. Keto-approved
2. No Carbs
3. No sugar I think it'd be important to show how many grams of protein are right on the front of the package as well. Protein is an important part of a keto diet and that may draw some people in to start incorporating milk into their daily life rather than just thinking of meats as proteins. 

There are two brands that I think do a really great job with their keto friendly products. One is think! Keto protein bars. Here is the link to their product: 

https://shop.thinkproducts.com/think-keto-protein-bars-chocolate-peanut-butter-pie/p/tkp-718392&c=thinkproducts@bars@keto

and also, Keto cups by Evolved. Here is the link to their product. 

https://eatingevolved.com/collections/keto-cups

I choose both of these products because they are very obvious, straight forward and bold with their labels. You know everything you need to know about it right away. Also, the keto is big, bold and even in the title. The simpler it is for the consumer the better. No one, especially now, wants to stand around in a cold grocery store searching for the nutrition facts. Up front, and straight forward is the way to go, I think! I think for sure seeing the word creamy would be important. I would also want to see an image of the milk being poured. For some reason when I see the milk being poured on other non-dairy milks it looks almost watery. I want to see how thick and rich and creamy the milk is. ""Thicker, creamier almond milk"" made me lean in. 

I guess it seems weird that if it's from the same orchards and everything as the other milks that Almond Breeze has produced that are not as rich and creamy why would be believe that this one is. What was done to make this milk different is something I would want to know. Also, I think saying that the whole family can enjoy is a waste of the description. Utilize the short sentences that you have to inform us about how and why this is rich and creamier than other products. We should KNOW that it's rich and creamy from the description not just trust that you're saying it's rich and creamier. Absolutely the third one! I love that it explains that the almond oil is put in to make it creamier. 

Contrary to the ""the whole family can enjoy"" I like that this one was specific to the thought that kids won't really know the difference with this one. 

I also really love when it said ""I am becoming more conscious about what I feed myself and my family and am trying to encourage a plant-based lifestyle to support our overall health."" I think this will resonate with people because if you talk to someone they are always trying to change their diet for better overall health and that usually includes plant-based items. I think people will see that and know it's something they should add into their diet. I would say in regards to the three concepts I think it's not necessary to say that you're transported to an almond farm and phrases of that nature. When people think almonds they don't think thick, creamy milk. I think that is having the consumer picture the wrong image. You want them to picture something that they don't associate with almond milk. Maybe give the image of the almond oil. Or talk more on that. Maybe even have that in the image on the packaging. I want to know more about that.                      2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
379855,Abigail,Breslin,abbybres@yahoo.com,"       I would look for pretty obvious cues such as ""ZzZz"" or an image of the moon. I would also pay attention to overall coloring indicating it's different than the normal product, and a color that I associate with calmness. If it's a food product I would make sure it says ""natural"" sleep enhancing ingredients. No strange additives. 1) I liked the words ""infused with natural ingredients"" and ""nourish and relax."" I was also intrigued by the fact that it's meant to drink warm. Curious if it's safe to microwave or do they recommend warming on the stove?

2) This may be a personal opinion, but ""Renew"" initially makes me think of morning. I liked ""Dream"", not sure if that was a name option. Otherwise the description appealed to me. No major changes. 

3) I would be intrigued by Ashwagandha because I've heard good things about it. I just don't know what it would taste like or if it wouldn't be noticeable to my taste buds.

4) I don't think the family aspect should be the focus, because if the parents like it and use it individually, then they will adopt the ritual for the kids on their own. If you market it as a family ritual you may lose out on customers that are single and assume it's a kid product. 1) So is this one the same, just not meant to be consumed warm? Words I liked were ""relax and destress"" and ""mindful moment."" Even though I understand the idea of ""slow down and lift you mood"" the words ""slow"" and ""lift"" may seem contradictory to some.

2) ""Calming lift to relax and recenter"" might be confusing. I'm thinking ""lift"" just needs to be removed entirely because I associate that with energy, not relaxation. 

3) Again, I'm personally okay with Ashwagandha because I've been curious about it. I know it's a natural ingredient - would just wonder if that affects the flavor at all.

4) If I were to buy Almond Breeze Calm, I imagine I would have it sometime between dinner and bed. If I had a more hectic daily schedule, like a parent, perhaps I would have it in the morning or midday. For me, I'm interested in the relaxation early evening. During the day I'm on the hunt for energy, not necessarily anything calming or relaxing. I like the idea of Renew more because it's targeted towards nighttime and sleep aid, which I feel like most people are looking for rather than a mid-day mindful moment. I still am not in love with the name ""renew"" because it brings to mind morning and energy. Would vote for ""Dream"" if that were an option. I have lavender scented everything for my bedtime rituals including a lavender candle, my essential oil diffuser with lavender/peppermint/eucalyptus, and a chilled lavender-infused face mask I pull out of the freezer. In the Fall/Winter I drink ""sleepytime"" tea or ""extra sleepytime"" with valerian. None of these have any cool or interesting branding, however the #1 brand I would recommend studying is Olly. I take their multivitamins, but they do have a ""SLEEP"" supplement. I think they do an incredible job branding.

Firstly the spicy dill pickle almonds, because I’m a sucker for anything pickle related. Next I was surprised to find the gourmet flavors. I’ve never heard of them or seen them, but now I’ll be on the lookout. One in particular I would want to try is Garlic, Herb, & Olive Oil. I love garlic and never thought about combining the flavor with almonds. I really like that the website has a “Ways To Pair Gourmet” tab because I would never know what they work best with. I don’t really have any remarks on what to do better. The photos are amazing, the packaging is nice, the website is user-friendly. I have my mom to thank for getting me into your Wasabi & Soy flavor. I would have never thought to buy those, but she had them at her house and told me they were great. I could never eat wasabi on it’s own, but I did learn to like wasabi peas over the years, so I figured these were worth a shot. I simply love the flavor combo. It’s a totally unexpected love for me. I’d love to see this collection grow. It’s true most adventurous flavored snacks are unhealthy, so I would definitely keep an eye on what Blue Diamond comes up with. (Chocolate and chili powder, please!) I’ve noticed Lay’s making bold moves. I mentioned their recent city collaboration featuring hot chicken from Nashville and a few other food scene favorites from across the US. I do like how simple their packaging is. It’s not over cluttered with imagery or information, so when there is a new flavor it’s deadly obvious just by looking at it sitting on the shelf. My most recent favorite is their dill pickle chips.    I took notice of the words “wow my tastebuds” and “excitingly bold flavor experience.” The energetic feeling is really enticing in that it truly will be an experience not just a boring old snack to solve your hunger. I don’t think “boldly covering an almond” is necessary. It just doesn’t sound right at all, and sort of insinuates that the almond needs to be disguised by flavor, when in reality the almond works with the seasoning. As far as naming goes, I’m a sucker for alliteration. Perhaps something like “Adventurous Almonds.” The dark chocolate and chili is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. Very excited for those. I know a lot of people like maple bacon, but maple can be a little too sweet for me. Very curious about black pepper and cheddar. This one sounded most bizarre, but could always surprise me. Similarly not sure about sriracha and almond butter, but I LOVE sriracha so I would certainly try. Matcha mint makes sense but not a fan. I think since wasabi soy was such a success, people would love to see more wild flavors. I suppose the way to go would be to find combinations that already exist in foods. My personal fav would be spicy dill pickles, so perhaps finding inspiration like that. Hot pepper flakes are the best! I’m now imagining some sort of pizza flavor with basil and very light on the crushed pepper flakes. As far as year-round I would absolutely say the dark chocolate chili, but I would have to taste test the others! If you take my advice with “adventurous almonds” or something similar, you could really take the marketing approach of traveling with our taste buds since we’re all extremely limited on travel options for the foreseeable future (especially us stupid Americans.)        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
235017,Michelle,Meyer,michellemeyerj@gmail.com,"            There are two products that stood out for me. The first one is the Almond Nut Thins Sriracha flavor and the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds. I would choose both of these flavors because I feel they are different and unique in terms of flavor and combination. I feel these would be great to snack on! Specifically for the nut thins I believe the packaging and information in the box is crucial to convince people to buy it. I would include what can you eat it with... because people very often see it and are not sure what they could use it with and end up not buying the product. So for example maybe with a hummus dip, with a seaweed salad or a simple cream cheese dip. If you show these ideas in the boxing customers don't have to think so much in terms of what to use them and buy it! The same goes with the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds, although these are a bit more straighforward because you can eat them as a simple snack I am sure they would go amazing with a noodle salad or some other Asian dish. 

Blue Diamond needs to distribute these products internationally... we only get the regular almonds in Mexico!! I would choose some of these flavors but definitely not all of them. The wasabi and the spicy dill would be my top options because I know in my head what the flavors are. I would need to taste the others before buying them especially the Habanero because as a Mexican I know its a very spicy chilly and Im not sure it would be a good fit with the BBQ. I feel that whats missing is describing the flavors in the packaging so people are convinced to buy them. As I mentioned earlier I wouldn't buy the flavors that don't convince me without trying them beforehand and I am sure this is the case with the majority of consumers. 

Note: There is a spelling mistake on the website! Its Habanero NOT Habañero Im going have to go for a local Mexican brand for this. 
Susalia https://www.susalia.com/ has been extremely popular and succesfull because they have offered healthy snacks using flavors Mexicans love, and their secret is using nopal (the plant of the cacti) for their chips and snacks which is a very healthy ingredient. They have launched Flame, Nacho, Lime Chili, and Strong Chile flavor for their chips which have been extremely popular. They also have Kale chips with olive oil and lime chilli which is a very healthy snack using ingredientes mexicans love. They also offer tortilla chips, tortillas and tostadas all made with nopal to use for mexican dishes such as chilaquiles, quesadillas and tostadas. Its a brand that understood the importance of offering healthier products without taking away the delicious flavor of snacks we all love.  

I think Blue Diamond can learn that they must customize based on different markets they sell to. They cant sell everything the same flavor and concept to the whole USA or even the world. In states where there is a large Asian community I would emphasize more asian bold flavors, and similar with states with lots of Mexican population where chili and lime are a must.    1) I feel the idea of discovering new flavors definitely catched my attention. Also the word BOLD makes me think of taking risks, being adventurous so it goes quite well with the concept. 

2) I wouldn't include ""junk food"" in the overall wording because it feels like you are discrediting the competition I would just use healthier options... the rest I like! 

 3) Creative Almonds, Original Almonds, Venture Almonds 1) I think these flavors are risky yet interesting! I definitely love the most the maple bacon, matcha mint and sriracha almond butter. I would need to try the dark chocolate chilli and the black pepper cheddar but these are the ones that put me off and make me doubt if the combination of flavors go together. 

2) I would definitely inlcude some more classic flavors because not all customers are willing to explore and take such a big risk with new flavors. Definitely Chocolate Sea Salt sounds amazing so does Mango Tajin especially if you want to target a more Latino/Mexican crowd. Others intersesting flavors would be Oreo, White Chocolate, Almond Butter, Parmesan and Acai. 

3) Definitely I would produce some flavors only for the holiday season including Matcha Mint, Maple Bacon,  Pumpkin Spice, Pecan Pie. I feel you have to have a balance between very risky flavors and more conventional ones so you please a larger audience of customers and more importantly not loose any loyal customers. Also, would love to get this original flavors internationally!!        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
334670,Rose,Aiello,BIKRAMPHILE@GMAIL.COM,"               I feel like there were definitely more savory options than sweet ones. For me, the one that really hit the mark was the assortment of almond yogurts. I'm also interested in the crafted snack almonds which are mixed with dried fruits.
Yogurt tends to be standard - I already think of Blue Diamond for Almond Milk and almond yogurt. The elevated snack almonds I mentioned seem unique. 
I really love Kind Bars, especially the ones made with almonds and coconut. I think Blue Diamond should make bars too, since almonds are their specialty.
I'd also love to see almond-based whipped cream for desserts. I like these offerings very much- I noticed the fruit & almond range in the last exercise. I hadn't noticed the oven-roasted range, but I do like this one too, but I do like the variety mixed with fruit better because it's a different set of mouth textures - crunchy and chewy along with sweet and savory flavors.
I would definitely choose either product to try and I could most definitely see myself enjoying the almond & fruit range multiple times per week, as a snack and by adding it to yogurt too. This idea is interesting- I do like the selected nut coatings, but I wish there was milk chocolate, caramel and vanilla flavors. My favorite product was Lemon Bliss- this is a new flavor profile I have seen for nuts and I think it would be unique and refreshing.
I like the Skinny Dip, for the fact they aren't dusted with flavor powder, they seem to be frosted. But I can see having products that are both dusted or coated in my life for different snacking occasions. Both Blue Diamond and Skinny Dip seem to have the same amount of sugar.     I don't think this really needs improvement. I like this concept as it is. It  feels complex, yet wholesome.   Almond and Fruit draws me in. It sounds more elevated than ""trail mix"".   I like fruit derived sources and agave.   10g of carbs sounds acceptable for a healthy yet delicious snack.   I can really relate to many currently available ""healthy"" snacks being loaded with lots of sodium - the antithesis of anything healthy, or strange sugar alcohols that aren't great for your digestive system. I also like the phrase ""Oven-Roasted"", because it takes me back to childhood when I would oven roast pumpkin seeds with my family around Halloween. No added sugar or oil is also attractive, and knowing that the product is sweetened with Monkfruit is interesting and sounds natural and not as harmful. I also like the flavor variety-I'm a big fan of chocolate-inspired flavors.   I'd build on the concept by having the almonds dusted with other nutritious ingredients like flax seed, or pumpkin- both which are great for fiber intake and digestion. I dont think anything about this description needs to be changed. I like it at is, otherwise.   I also like the term ""Sprinkled"". It sounds like ""Dusted"", but a bit more fun, like a snack.  2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""Working through this part of the project has made me really hungry for all of them, especially the Dipped concept and I wish I had some now.

As far as a healthy snack I think Blue Diamond may be able to take some pointers from- one of my favorite nut mix brands is Sahale Snacks - www.sahalesnacks.com

225811,Renee,Townsend,rtown50@sbcglobal.net,"            I was drawn to the sea salt and whole blueberry.  I was interested in the salty and tart combination and liked the healthy indications of nuts and fruit.  Blueberries are super healthy.  I do think that the label could be more interesting than just whole blueberries.  Maybe something like blueberry tart or sweet emon blueberry or even juicy blueberry.   I think Blue Diamond is doing a great job with snack.options.  The pairing section is a great idea and very appealing.   I didn't notice anything with lemon though.   Maybe lemon cinnamon. I like the Bold range.  There are some interesting and intriguing flavors.  I was leaning into the spicy dill pickle because I really like pickles and although I like the straightforward wording of artificial, I would prefer natural flavorings.  I new mash up might include a seafood offering such as Cajun crabmeat. I actually find the Lay's potato chip flavors very new and exciting.   It seems like I see new flavor combos often.  One flavor I would not expect in a potato chip is grilled cheese and tomato soup.  It sounds enticing and comforting to me.  I think Blue Diamond could take note that all combos don't have to be exotic but can include comfort foods.    1.  I leaned in because I wanted to find out what was meant by bold.  I especially liked these phrases:  wow your taste buds, healthier snacks, invigoratesenses,  bring fun to snacking.
2.  I think i would add something about being a guilt free snack because I want to feel I can enjoy something without regretting it afterward.
3.  Bold and Bountiful or Big and Bold, Savory and Satisfying. 1.  I really like maple bacon because I like the sweet, meaty combo.   I'm not so sure about Sriracha and almond butter.
2.  I would like to see some classic and some wild available all the time.  Apple lavender sounds good.  Kiwi and ginger. Watermelon and cinnamon. Hibiscus and caramel. Jalapeño and toasted coconut.
3.  I think the fruity lighter flavors should be seasonal and available during the warmer weather. I can see the five available flavors listed as year round. I just think the the idea of the almond and the healthy factor should not get lost with too much fuss.

300180,Daria,Wilcocks,dariawilcocks@gmail.com,"            The spicy dill pickle 'Bold' almonds!

This combines one of my favourite things (dill pickles) at the moment with an unusual pairing of almonds, so I was instantly intrigued. I'd choose this product because it offers me a chance to incorporate the flavour that I know and love of pickles but in a more satisfying, filling way by blending with an almond. I would also choose this because it's not a boring way to consume nuts on their own, it would excite my tastebuds and give me a new experience with every mouthful. It would also stand me apart from my friends or family if they saw I had these, they would undoubtedly comment on my unusual flavour choice - they're a conversation starter!

I'd change the description of it being 'artificially flavoured' although I'm not sure if this is a legal requirement. No one really wants to acknowledge straight away that the flavourings are not the real deal, even if the ingredients used to mimic dill pickles are not suspicious, but it may put people off who are searching for a healthier snacking alternative

I think the word 'Bold' on the packaging is jarring, it doesn't look as sophisticated as the other font, not that it needs to be overly sophisticated but I think there's a better 'bold' font that would work better to make the packaging look more appealing overall. I also looked at the ingredients and notice that 'Natural Flavouring' is in there, could this be highlighted on the pack at all aside from the Artificially Flavoured line? Not sure if there's a way to re-word it, such as Flavoured with Natural Ingredients? 1. Well, seeing as I chose the Bold range for my previous answer, it's clear it's one of the ranges I'm most drawn to! I really like the idea of blending what is traditionally quite a creamy tasting nut with really punchy flavours such as these. I think the flavour options are really exciting, I'd try all of them and when I read them they make me salivate! 

2. I would choose these in a supermarket yes, because they offer me the chance to have an interesting snack on standby in the house - one that I can return to in a resealable package (unless I eat/share them all in one go as they'd be very moreish). I'd choose the salt and vinegar ones as an alternative to crisps, I'd choose the Wasabi & Soy ones as a way to snack before a big meal because I can't imagine eating loads in one go, the rest I can imagine having as a treat to enjoy with a film or relaxing during the day.

3. Yes, I could definitely see this extended and I'd like to see some sweet variations in there too 1. https://walkers.co.uk/
2. There isn't a current flavour of Walkers that is a limited edition I love at the moment, however, this was the first snacking brand I thought of when thinking about weird limited edition flavours as they have become famous for these launches over the years, alongside their core, classic options that everyone knows and loves. Here is an example of some of the flavour combinations they release at Christmas time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gppodiQMGl0 I like that they have got involved with the Christmas spirit even though it's naturally not a category that you would expect to see take on 'classic' Christmas dinner flavour ways e.g brussel sprouts, but it somehow sounds intriguing and makes you want to taste all of them! Even if it's to talk about them with your mates and have an opinion, or even discover that you really like a flavour combination that you thought you'd hate.
3. What's great about the limited edition ranges that Walkers have is that they are not afraid to go for controversial combinations that divide opinion (take their current Marmite flavour collaboration as an example) which will secure them publicity and get people talking. They don't feel the need to please a mass audience, which in turn, makes them well known for exciting new products and also makes them stand out from the competition. We're used to seeing some bolder flavour combinations in the snacking category now, so I think Blue Diamond has the opportunity to be quite daring with their new releases and mark themselves out from the rest. They are also quite tongue-in-cheek in the types of flavours and promotion around them that they launch, perhaps Blue Diamond can take some of this lighthearted approach when it comes to deciding what bold flavours they'll choose. At the end of the day, choosing new snacking treats should be fun and exciting and this particular range doesn't need to be as sophisticated as their 'Crafted' range for example.    1. 
- 'Challenge your tastebuds' : This conjures up imagery of me going on a taste journey with a product, it certainly won't be bland and it will be something that I am curious to try and try again to 'work out' what it's doing to my tastebuds!
- 'boldly covering' made me lean in and take notice because it makes me think that I'm getting a lot out of one product, it makes me assume that each nut has plenty of flavouring or coating on it to truly enjoy. It's not shy and it will make me feel satisfied with every bite.
- 'taste adventures' again makes me feel like I'm going to be going on a real journey of exploration with the brand, not only settling for the first flavour combo I try but keen to delve into other unusual combinations and sensations. 
- ' naturally flavoured' - ticks all my boxes about what I hope a bold, unique snacking treat can deliver me without compromising on health or being a bland, boring health product
- bring a bit of fun to your snacking' - I like because it's not common for a snacking product that is this high quality or bold to also feel fun unless it's a sweet treat in my opinion. It gives a general sense of what the brand might be like and how I want it to fit into my lifestyle.

2. (my version)

Discover our new range of Blue Diamond Bold Almonds. We began by creating the original Wasabi & Soy almonds; a tried and tested flavour combination that challenged tastebuds and left you wanting more.

Transport your senses and bring a bit of fun to your snacking with our new flavour combinations, sure to take you on a new taste adventure every time! With whole, dry roasted almonds naturally flavoured to boldly go where no other almonds have gone before.

3. I think Bold is a pretty strong range name already, but other options could be:

- Flips
- Take 2
- Twists 1. They sound really varied and yummy to me, they would definitely catch my eye in a supermarket! The only flavour I'm not as keen on is Maple Bacon, not because I don't think it would work (it would) but compared to the other options this feels quite 'safe' and not really the unexpected contrast of flavours that the other combinations have going for them. My favourite would be Sriracha & Almond Butter as I think it sounds the most potent in terms of how it would feel in your mouth texture-wise and how it would challenge your tastebuds taste-wise.

2. I think it's a hard balance but definitely would veer towards wanting more exotic flavour combinations that I'd reach for time and time again. I think the sweet/savoury combos are always a good shout e.g Mexican Chicken & Dark Chocolate, Cheddar & Plum Chutney or themed cuisine ones e.g Turkish Rose Water & Touch of Sea Salt, Thai spiced Mango & Creamy Coconut

3. I think the Cheddar & Black Pepper would be a great 'core' product in the range, that satisfies a lot of different customers, also Dark Chocolate & Chilli for a classic twist on a sweet treat. I think you could do a festive twist on the Maple Bacon flavour, you could also do create flavours to match the seasons that are limited edition like Cinnamon Spiced Pumpkin Pie, Toasted Marshmallow & Coffee in Autumn or Pina Colada & Sherbet, Strawberry Crush & Basil in Summer. I do think that the range needs to stand for something that is consistent throughout the flavourways, for example I keep drawing on the contrasting flavours. They need to genuinely contrast each other e.g sweet and savoury for it to become a well-known part of the Blue Diamond product offering. Otherwise, I think the ideas behind the flavor ways could get lost amongst the other flavourings added to the different snacking almond products.        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,

The flavor combinatiosn for this category are spot on! The sugar content is between 4-7 which seems like a healthy-ish range ( you wouldnt feel guilty eating it).  The one thing that feels like it could be changed across all of the prodcuts is the branding- it feels somewhat oputdated ( The Blue Diamond logo, the font, and the sketch of what i guess is an amond field in the background?) 1. All of the Almond and Fruit ranges look great! And the flavor combos are all very compelling. Nutirition contents are spot on as well ( low sugar, bit of protein). The oven roasted looks less compelling ( almost unecessary to have when you have the Almond and Fruit offering).

2. The only reason I would not choose one of these is becuase of  the ""commitment"" to buying a full bag- there is no portion control. When it comes to a sweet snack offering, I need to to be told how much to eat or else i eat the whole thing. 1. Oh wow- this is better. The branding feels modern and young and fun. The imagery is more delicious, feels more like a desert or true sweet snack option.

2. I mean i want all of them- Dark Cholcate peanut butter might be preferred, but really all of the flavors look great! The protein sugar combo rivals blue diamond as well which is an eays win. They also offer individual packs, which answered my previous call out about protion control with Blue Diamond. 

3. I almost feel bad for Blue Diamond :( This brand looks a lot newer, and mroe vibrant. Everyone loves a ""covered"" nut and Skinny dips goes beyond just almonds. Individual sized packs vs just a bag is a win for skinny dip too.  ""Free shipping"" band at the top of the site is great  too.     Id like to see the term ORGANIC included around the fruit. That would really make me feel this is a healthy option.   ""Almond fruit fusion"" "" Juicy fruit and almonds"" ""Handful of health- fruit and almond mix""   Honey Maple Syrup Date syrup   less than 5G   "" I live a health-forward lifestyle but I have a sweet tooth"" - I thought, okay that describes me perfectly. "" Dusted Almonds"" - Thats a nice way to describe the almond, it makes me feel like the almond itself, and its healthy properties are still intact, except now dusted with flavor.   "" Dusted in real food ingredients"" The real food ingredients part is a little wordy. If its dusted i dont think i want it dusted in ""ingredients"" I want it dusted in a single thing/flavor. ""all natural ingredients"" - i wish this read ORGANIC ingredients instead.   I like ""Dusted Almonds"" as a stand alone name.

IF you asked my 3 months ago when the last time was that i bought cereal, I would have told you when i was 15 years old. Then i discovered Magic Spoon and I hav spent over $100 on it since May. I eat it as a breakfat , snack, and dessert. If Blue Diamond coould create an almond that satisfied multuiple cravings, it would be a huge win.",Cypher,
225809,Pavithra,Sivamani,psivamani@gmail.com,"               1) I liked two products. From the website link above, I liked the Dark chocolate and Coconut almonds. However, I stumbled across the online shop and they have such yummy options! I am in love with the look of the lemon creme almonds - it is one of my favorite flavors and I had already mentioned it in the previous activity as a possible flavor variant. Though lemon creme is my choice, I'll stick to the dark chocolate almonds for the questions as it is from the linked website. Also, I do not have sufficient info on the lemon almonds

- I liked these since it is close to one of my existing sweet snacks (Kirkland chocolate almonds) with an additional taste of coconut. When you eat something with sugar, it sends a signal to your brain to keep eating more. That's why sugar is so addictive. I believe the coconut may help reduce this binging and it may even taste nice with the chocolate
- Though this product looks nice, I would never buy it as I am dead against Stevia. It also has sugar and Stevia! Blue Diamond could consider making this naturally sweetened using dates or other fruit
- There are so many new products on the site but I hardly ever see these at the supermarket! The only Blue Diamond products with great visibility are Almond Breeze and the classic almonds. I am sure most people are not even aware of this great range. The online store could also be organized much better with shipping offers to induce trials

2) Since baking with almond flour is trending now, I'd suggest shortbread cookies or trail mix cookies or pre-packaged brownies with almond flour, naturally sweetened if possible. 1) I think the only difference is the oven roasted bit and to me, that's not different enough. For example, the oven roasted blueberry almonds and the Sea salt & blueberry almonds are almost the same, even ingredients wise. A shopper would never know the difference if he has not seen the product portfolio like I just did. Also, packaging wise, the Almonds & Fruit range follows a very neat and uniform design code while I feel the oven roasted range could do better (the toasted coconut is totally out of line). There are also many ingredient similarities between the two ranges - coconuts, sea salt, blueberry, cocoa, etc. They may as well have the almonds and fruit range in roasted and non-roasted variants

2) Nope. All the products have Stevia in it and I would never choose Stevia. I would have been okay with the sugar, just a big no to Stevia. If not for this, I would have chosen the dark chocolate almonds. At this point, eating one serving of this snack (as per calorie info on the site) would be still within my daily limit of sugar and fat intake - I follow Myfitnesspal to track calories and macro nutrients. I also liked the addition of the coconut bits. For me to choose one of these products, it should be Stevia free to begin with. Naturally sweetened using dates, fruits, etc would have been awesome! If using sugar, natural unprocessed forms of sugar like palm sugar, jaggery, coconut sugar, etc will be a healthier option 1) Love the website! The products look very inviting and are designed in a very cool manner. Since the company is small, it comes across as very personable. Like a small, intimate gathering  vis-a-vis a large, crowded one. Also, products from small, family owned, boutique style shops are very in these days. They just have cashews and almonds in around 5 or 6 flavor variants. I like that they do not use stevia, they use cane sugar or maple sugar

2) I like the Lemon bliss almonds. I liked that the yogurt coating may be a good change from the typical chocolate covering. Lemon creme is one of my favorites - its sweet and tangy and its great for portion control because you simply cannot overdose on it! Also, 16 almonds is quite a filling amount and 9g of sugar is well within my limits. It would have been nice if it was naturally sweetened, but this has maple sugar, so it's not all that bad

3) Words like real ingredients, low sugar, etc are compelling reasons to buy. Blue Diamond could use such words. Also, their packaging is very uniform. The Almonds & fruit packaging is really nice but their overall packaging is not consistent.     To begin with, I would have more flavors and some better combos of nut and fruit. I would not use monk fruit as it is relatively new and the health benefits / risks have not been studies over a long period of time. Also, it is not clear if these are oven roasted or if they have oil   Almond & Fruit does the job but some other names could be Blue Diamond fruit tango, Almond medley, Nut & fruit duet   In this concept, naturally sweetened is the best bet but honey and raw sugar would be all right too   Fruits are about as high in sugars as snacks with sugars in them - the difference being that fruit sugars are healthier. However, since my calorie counter takes fruit sugars into account as well, I'd stick to 10g per 1/4th cup serving   I like the word dusted. Even better than thinly dipped, though I do not understand the difference between dusting and dipping - its coated eventually! Dusting makes it sound stylish and trendy. Apart from this, the usual - Oven roasted, no added oil, real food ingredients - are all good   Monkfruit is a sweetener to me. Stevia also comes from a plant but it is also a sweetener. I would rather use raw sugar, brown sugar or maple syrup to sweeten these flavors because none of the flavors have fruit in them (except for maybe coconut but that Doesn't make it sweet).    Pantry almonds, because it uses ingredients readily available in the pantry. Or Cacao robed almonds. Catch up with Cacao.  2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""Organic and / or Non GMO labels are important to me. If we could tailor any of these concepts to kids too, that would be awesome.

Maybe a back to school edition for kids?


I have not found a sweet, low in sugar snack of late that has looked appetizing enough for me to pick up. Also, August has seen at least 3 Indian festivals that we have celebrated so health has taken a slight backseat this month. Instead, here's a great low sugar sweet that I made. Slightly roasted a cup of skinned, unsalted peanuts and pulsed it with 1/3 cup of jaggery. The heat from the peanut was enough to help bind and roll the dough into small balls.

2-An improvement would be more flavor options, for more variety, I see that there are no added sugars here, but there must be something in the product to help sweeten it, so I would like to know more about that-what these ingredients are, and their net effect carbs. I also don't think I have ever heard of MCT Oil, so since the brand brings it up, I'd like if they could explain more about what this is. 1-Keto-Certified. For me, this term is much stronger and sounds more official, a product that would definitely meet my needs around the Keto lifestyle.
2-Carb-Free. This sounds more honest. There are barbs in almost everything, except most meats. I think they mean that the net carbs are zero, hence free, but still there.
3-No added sugar. This also sounds like the most honest statement, as everything has sugar, but in this case, none is being added. I don't think we have missed anything. I'd really like to learn more about this product and am eager to know when or if it becomes available.

I really enjoy drinks by Bai- they only have 1 gram of sugar, so they are Keto friendly.

252375,Michelle,Hopper,michellehopper1981@gmail.com,"               Ok, so, right away I wanted to choose the dark chocolate cocoa dusted almonds because I felt that being dusted with dark chocolate cocoa isn't as bad as eating chocolate covered almonds. Then I went to look at the ingredients and found there to be sugar, corn maltodextrin (form of sugar) and stevia extract (sugar substitute). So for me, this would be a hard no since there is sugar listed not only once but 3 times. That's what, 40% of ingredients are sugar. Unfortunately, a hard no.

Next I went to find something else I could choose, figuring that since we are trying to reduce the sugar, I though there would surely be another option. 

So I went for the honey roasted thinking, well honey is a natural sugar so it won't hurt me to have unrefined sugar right, and again, found similar ingredients in the list. Sugar being the second ingredient. 

I was excited to see the almonds and fruit options because, I thought natural fruit would be a great sweet option. Sadly I continued to find sugar, maltodextrin and stevia in most of the packages. 

The only option I found that I would consider eating for myself was the sea salt almonds and whole blueberries. There was cane sugar listed which I still consider sugar but it's a bit less refined than regular sugar.  

I don't find the almond nut thins to be a sweet treat. I wouldn't crave that type of product when I have a sweet craving.

For me, there are just too many additives in these products. There has to be a way, to merge sugarless fruit without all the added sugars. 

When I think of having a sweet treat, I want to bite into something, like a bar, or something chewy. Using the dried fruit but in a more creative way, like date bars with the almonds would be good. You could still have natural honey, whole bluberries, coconut, sugar free cocoa powder. 

Having said all of this, from someone who doesn't eat sugar, it sounds so harsh. I know most people do not read the labels like I have to. I'm sure, to the average person, these are all great choices. 

I do feel though, they are hiding alot of unessessary sugars in their products. See previousl answer. Apologies, but I went ahead and answered this with the previous question So, I've compared all the ingredients with each flavour. Still finding too much sugar (for me, who literally doesn't eat anything with sugar). Although, I noticed that some of their sugar ingredients were organic maple syrup, cane sugar, sugars from the chocolate or caramels (these are the refined sugars) So, they are not completely all refined or the worst. But still there.

I will say, chances are I would choose these products over the blue diamond solely because of the less sugar component. 

I noticed the lemon option only had a slight amount of sugar in the yogurt coating which to me is the healthiest option. I'm not a lover of lemon so I typically wouldn't choose that flavour. 

I think blue diamond could choose better sweetening options. More natural sweeteners.     I would remove the 'low in sugar' wording as you are already stating that it is naturally sweetened. The fruit part already explains how. Not sure about the 'obsession' wording either as an obsession would mean more than a fruit when wanting something sweet to me. The wording Collision could be changed... Combination, mixture, blend.... 
 To me the idea of 'Collision' and 'Delight' don't go together well.  So if using 'Collision', changing 'Delight' to something more like 'excite' or 'Awaken'   Almond Sweet Naturals, Fruity Almonds,   Same as previous   Same as previous   Dusted - again, indicates carefully cared for product Real Food Ingredients - assuring Subtly Sweet - again, indicates not overdone with sugar All natural - confirms nothing added Absolutely no sugar added - now that's confidence I can trust  
   Again, sounds great to me!  One thing I don't care for is the subtly Sweet  'mouthful'... Could replace with something like 'taste',  or 'flavour' 
 When I snack on almonds, I don't eat by the mouthful, especially if they are sweet, I would want to savour each one.

334672,Tammy ,Butterworth ,tammy.butterworthusa@icloud.com,"       I would be looking for a product I can drink through the day, which can instantly help me to feel relaxed or calmed. 
I would be looking for ingredients which I know have a benefit in this space. 
The product would need to be healthy- I don’t want to have high sugar in exchange for relaxation or stress reduction. 1. I like the name renew- I will sleep well and wake up feeling renewed, that works for me. 
Ready to drink- I don’t want to have to do lots of prep- so this would fit my lifestyle, especially at the end of the day. Self care is hard to fit in, this would be so easy. 
Almond milk- I love that it is dairy alternative. 
Infused with natural ingredients- I am imagining a lovely gentle flavor. 
Warm- yes- I want a warm cozy hug before bed- YES!!!
Nourish and relax is a nice idea- I would love to know I am doing that, and prioritizing a good nights sleep too. 
Energy I need to keep pace- this will be good- I can be infocused, forgetful, and pretty grumpy- I know sleep will help with this. I feel like I NEED this product. 

2. Honey- does it have to have it already in there, can I sweeten to taste? I don’t want lots of sugar. 
I am worried about how much I should drink to see a benefit- will it disturb me in the night with a need to use the restroom? 
Not sure cherry feels restful- maybe I had too many tart cherries. 

3. I would se the ashwaganda in a mid-afternoon relaxing product, rather than a sleep product. 

4. Bedtime is about me- my kids are little and already asleep- and I can’t get them interested in warm milky drinks at all. I personally think this is about giving yourself me-time and self care, even if you don’t have the time. It’s a wellness hack for you, so you can be there for the family in the morning. 
Keep as is for me please. 1. Calm- I need this at certain points, and feel it would help me to focus. 
Ready to drink- I don’t have time to prep- even boiling the kettle can take too long. 
Naturally calming- relax and reset- yes- I would love this mid afternoon when the day is getting too long, or when I am doing bedtime with the kids and they are pushing each and every one of my buttons. 
Any time of day- suggests no caffeine is involved, so I can use for stressful moments later on and not compromise my sleep. 
Mindful moment, savor, lift mood- this just sounds like such a nice escape- quick to jump into, indulge, and then get back to it- perfect. 

2. I’d like to see more varied botanicals or herbs in the flavors- these worked for sleep- but for ‘savoring’ I need a little more intrigue/complexity. 
I’s like a reassurance on low sugar. 
I think I want this to have a smooth/creamy texture. 

3. Yes- ashwaganda here would be great, maybe lions main and reishi too- any of the adatpogenic ingredients. 

4. I would be on a mid afternoon break at work (or before a big event), or doing bedtimes with the kids- we are all tired and stressed, if I can stay calm and diffuse, how nice would life be. I feel like I need a little lift to get me through the end of the day. I am not alone, but not being sociably either- am happy to dive into a few moments of ‘me time’. I feel like having this product as it will transport me, and bring me back calm and ready to tackle that final push. I honestly love both- if I only had enough money to buy one...I would go renew- as I feel like setting me up for a whole great day is a bigger impact. I also feel like the product is more differentiated, I could get other drinks to calm me, but I have not seen many for sleep like this one. I’d like to know about the serving- and how to heat. For renew for example, is it a big bottle I put some in a cup and heat- what is the process? Where do I store it, how long does it last etc?                 2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
334674,Paula,Villaseñor,paulavibe@gmail.com,"I really like the product description and how it uses the word ""support"" a low carb, low sugar, healthy fat diet. - I believe it is very positive to phrase it as something that supports a lifestyle vs a quick fix to anything.
I think the nutritionist credential is quite powerful because more and more scientific based claims are gaining power, especially now after the heightened health awarness in consumers in general.
I also like that you added MCT oil to the mix, because this is quite an expensive ingredient on its own, so its good to have it as a Bonus.
The flavours are great.

I think the only point I would challenge is what does ""KetoCertified"" mean, is there some kind of Keto board reviewing and approving food or is this something you made up. I feel that when talking about certification you have to be super transparent on what that means or avoid it if its an empty claim. I am not sure I understand this question correctly.
I think I would pick as follows:
1. Keto-approved
2. No-carbs
3. No-added sugar For the first question I would definitively reference to the color cues associated with Keto (I am not sure if the traditional Blue-White hues from Blue Diamond visually connect with Keto, maybe they do) The other thing that a product like this can really help with cravings, when moving into Keto the first weeks are very tough so maybe claim something like a guiltfree, super satisfying addition to your new lifestyle.

A product that I have tried now that is Keto is Keto Ice-cream and I love that it exists. Like I shared, cravings on Keto are pretty intense at the beggining, so having some keto friendly alternatives that help you feel less deprived is a blessing.                          2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,ENFJ
198815,Sophie ,Lee,buddhaness@yahoo.com,"       Interesting formulations/ingredient combos, that I already know of or would be excited to be introduced to that are know relaxers. CBD, tart cherry, melatonin, turmeric, kava kava...etc. 1. I deeply resonte with words like renew, soothing, naturally nourish, rejuvenating, refreshed. Uplifting intentional words that has a positive vibration. Bring in the word/concept of mindful ritual... that the consumer is not all stressballs but taking good care of themselves and are managing well.
2. I don't relate to ""I find it hard to relax and unwind, that's affecting the quality of my sleep""... instead I prefer an encouraging message of I'm strengthening my practice of self care and mindfulness, that I intentionally drink warm turmeric latte/milk at night to facilitate good quality sleep (which I was regularly doing for a recent time). Instead of coming from the position of disempowerment and chaos, it's messaging of self-efficiency, self-love, self-care, empowered way of living.
3. I love that and would add brownie points. Whenever I see added herbs, quality natural ingredients I perceive it to have a higher quality/value and I think the brand is more progressive and holistic minded. Especially for night time, I'd be very excited to see ingredients that are beautifying such as collagen, pearl powder... ingredients that will boost radiance and wellbeing, not just sleep.
4. Personally, I'm single so family doesn't resonate. Also, I feel sleep, nightime rituals can be such a personal time. Husbands and wives, partners, go to sleep differently and i think i like the concept of focussing on the individual. I don't think less of the brand just because my family is not addressed in terms of night time activity. I find it quite odd actually to want to drag family into this. Not everything has to involve family. 1. I really like the product description. Mindful moment, savour, slow down, lift mood... I practice this daily so this is me. I can relate and would be interested in this.
I like the notion of taking time, that this product is a gateway to enjoyment, a simple pleasure. 
2. I personally dislike the word busy. It speaks of mindlessness, a term that glosses over things... a word that almost has no meaning. A word we all use when we don't want to engage. I prefer ""My life is eventful and unpredictable"". Also Don't relate to it's hard to find balance to feel my best. I feel more of us, especially since quarantine, we are managing after taking inventory of our life, what is important, and adopting practices that are good for us, that make us feel connected and centered in our life amidst the chaos. It would be very refreshing to me, to see a brand acknowledge and promote wellness, instead of perpetuating chaos. Even if most people are still living chaotic lives, what if the verbiage was that of an encouraging friend who cheered us on, that I am here for you, I believe in you, that you're doing so well...etc.
3. Again love. Any herbs, experimental new ingredients I am 100% behind.
4. I'm home alone. Chilling, enjoying my own company. It's late afternoon and it's afternoon tea time and I'm enjoying Calm with my dessert treat, matcha cake or french pastries. Or in the evening, I make it and get ready to watch something interesting on YouTube or Netflix, enjoying it with some raw chocolates or juicy dates. Calm adds a sense of comfort, wellbeing, like a cozy blanket, a warm companion of sorts. A healthy delightful addition, to round out my moment, to complete the day on an enhancing note. Renew. I prefer the concept of a warm drink. Personally I'd warm up Calm anyway because I generally don't drink too much cold beverages because it's shocking for the body (chinese medicine philosophy). https://clevrblends.com/collections/lattes

I've been really enjoying the golden superlatte. I love the formulations and all the superfood ingredients. 1. Fiery ghost pepper with tart cherry. I love juxtapositions, especially in flavor combinations. I like the idea of heat, tart, sweet together. The more complex the flavor profile is, the more interesting it is to me. 
2. Don't love that this has sugar in it. What kind of sugar? I understand there needs to be a balance of sweet in here. How about honey, monk fruit? I prefer natural sweetners. Also when i see natural flavors, maltodextrin... I get concerned. What hidden ingredients are classified within these... and doesn't maltodextrin spike sugar levels? I'd prefer to see even cleaner healthier ingredients. 
3. Mixing sweet and savory flavors... almost have a category that is unclassifiable. Updated trail mix category: with almonds, vegan impossible proteins, fruits. A go to snack that satisfies on multiple levels. 1. I think it's ok. Although I cringe when I see artificially flavored. Those I will not even look at in terms of putting it in my body. I would prefer if the ingredients are again cleaner & healthier. I personally don't love canola oil... I like seeing olive, avocado, sesame oils. Sugars, dextrose... anytime the ingredients list sound like a science lab instead of recognizable real foods, I'm not as open to buy. 
2. These feel like safer ""adventurous"" flavors. I generally get excited when I see new combinations that I've never seen before... or it's a familiar flavor but with an added twist.  Wasabi & soy with added candied spicy ginger chunks? Some element that makes it more distinct and even bolder.
3. Definitely. Mix it up with sweet & savory. Spicy & sweet. Bitter matcha chocolate yogurt almonds? 1. I noticed Brins Jam recently because of their adventurous interesting flavor combos i've never seen before.
2. Cherry shiso, lemon saffon, rosemary grapefruit. I like that they're familiar flavors with their unique twist. It's the thoughtful playfulness that I respond with. 
3. Since Brins is a small artisan producer, they can be experimental and be bold with limited edition flavors to test the market. I think it would be fun if Blue Diamond can have a experimental lab series, where they go wild with flavor combos and engage with their consumer that way. Let's say a small batch of 50 available, exclusively launched on social media. Or a special adventurous club people can join to try these wild flavors at a discount/value.    1. The why would i be interested really describes me to a T. I love that the concept is a taste adventure... words such as ""invigorate, fun, brighten, discovery, wow, enjoyable, interesting, exciting, bold"" are all resonant words. It's playful and speak to pleasure and being an experience. It's positive, uplifting and i'm all for it.

2. Instead of designed to invigorate your senses, I like ""composed to invigorate your senses."" Designed here feels engineered, like there's a scientific lab with flavor scientists tweaking flavors with weird powders..etc. Composed feels more artful, more friendly, more considered... like it's with your benefit in mind.

3. The Sensate Range. Because it's sensual & luscious. 1. I get that maple bacon is a classic combo... the sweet and savory. What if it's maple miso bacon? A slight complimentary twist that makes it even more interesting. How about black pepper & smoked cheddar? What if there's a little rose in the chilli with the dark chocolate? The flavors overall sound intriguing and i definitely would be curious to try them. Especially matcha mint, sriracha almond butter.

2. I would prefer more experimental exotic flavors. But it's classics with an updated twist. Familiar but something new. When I see chocolate & sea salt classic combos my inclination is not to reach for them. I think they are boring. However I'm also a bit apprehensive when it's so outrageous the flavors are not balanced enough to withstand the test of time and cravings. Apple lavendar & mango tajin are definitely interesting and I'd be very curious to try/sample... but it all depends on how well executed and if this is a new flavor frontier that will become a classic. If the exotic flavors are wonderful new surprising flavor finds, there would be extra brownie points and it would def make an impression in terms of segmenting Blue Diamond as a leader of flavor and to pay attention to. 

3 All 5 listed flavors sound accessible and can be available year round. The exotics like Apple Lavendar, Mango Tajin would be the seasonal/limited editions because they are more experimental so smaller batches makes sense to me. Thinking about the maple bacon flavor... is the bacon actual bacon bits? Impossible meat bits? Is it vegan friendly? Is it made with artificial flavoring or actual mesquite spices...etc. The quality of ingredients is always most paramount to my purchasing decision.        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,INFJ
334680,Sara,Belcaro,sara.belcaro@gmail.com,"   First and foremost, the packaging of the product is going to catch my eye.  Although I usually try to not judge a book by its cover, something its the other thing I have to determine whether to choose one item from the next.  Packages that usually appeal to me are ones that are simple, clean, and look as though they are not mass-produced or made my a big company. A great example of this is Three Trees Organic Original Almondmilk, Unsweetened. 

Once the item catches my eye, I will usually pick it up and start reading the label.  I usually look for key words such as ""organic,"" ""non-carrageenan"", ""sugar-free"", etc.  From my personal experience, in order for businesses to have the non-dairy milk live up to dairy milk (taste, creaminess, etc.), a lot of ingredients are added which I do not necessarily want to add into my diet.  Once I can confirm that the item I have picked up lives up to my dietary needs, I will then look at the ingredients as well as the nutritional facts to double check that there is no extra garbage added to the milk. 1. Specific words and phrases that would catch my eye and have me take notice are ""creamy texture,"" ""rich and creamy taste,"" and ""straight from our California orchards.""  The word creamy is definitely the first word that catches my attention.  As it states above, a lot of non-dairy milks are too watery and don't provide that need for a thick milk to add to coffee or cereal.  I am always looking for a non-dairy milk that is creamier than the next.  If the packaging states that the item is creamy and rich, I can assume that it is accurate.  I also love that the description mentions that California orchards in which the almonds are grown from.  I personally like to know where my food is coming from and the story behind it.  This shows me that there are farmers growing these almonds which produce the almond milk and creates more of a story behind the item.

2. I would remove ""normal dairy milk.""  I think the point of this is to make non-dairy milk the normal, so to point out that it may not necessarily be normal, it is bringing attention to the fact that the almond milk is not ""real.""  I feel as though it is important to make people open minded to the product and make it feel just as normal as buying dairy milk. The 2nd concept (giving more detail into the farms) resonates the most with me.  I love the description of ""why I am interested."" I feel that it is incredibly accurate.  I do miss the taste of whole dairy milk, but I know that using more non-dairy items in my diet is better for my health as well as the health of my fiance who is lactose intolerant.  I feel that there are so many options for non-dairy milks on the mark, so the story of the farms and the farmers really draws me in and makes the product feel more personal.  I believe that I create an attachment to certain brands and I am usually incredibly loyal to these brands.  If I feel as though an almond milk which is made from natural ingredients and is produced directly from the farm will create that consumer loyalty. I am interested in Blue Diamonds additives to the almond milk.  It does not seem as though organic or natural is used on the product or in the descriptions.  As I feel that there are so many organic and natural non-diary milks on the market, this may create a disadvantage.  I would like to see something regarding its ingredients as well and what it may be ""free of"" that other almond milks add to create a better taste or texture. 

If you would have asked me a week ago what non-diary milk has lived up to my expectations as a substitute for a diary milk, I would have said Oatly original oat milk.  But I have recently discovered that Oatly has additives to its oat milk such as sunflower oil and sugar to give it a better taste and texture.  This is not something that I want to add to my diet, especially the added sugars.  Although, the Oatly low-fat version does not contain the added oils and sugars.  This product is incredibly thin and does not have the same texture of the original or full-fat version, but it has great flavor and in my opinion, is the best option so far that I have tried.                      2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,INFJ
262618,Kate,Rushton,krushtie33@gmail.com,"       I would like to see his in the grocery store in the section for medicines, specifically near calms and other natural herbal options to help you sleep. 
In a hot country, maybe the milk could be frozen and in the freezer section, or alternatively it could be in the section for long-life milk. 
What would really make me take notice is if there was a sleep assessment on the packaging.
Or, maybe in the supermarket there could be the noise of sheep going ""baa"" as if you are counting sheep playing when you walk past?
I guess it could be refrigerated with markers on the packaging with ""dose"" levels. 
But, personally, I would like to see it as a long-life (cupboard) item that is under the liquid allowance for hand luggage for a flight. 
I would like to see it as part of a ritual act. Maybe you have the milk 30 mins before bedtime and in the 30 mins there is something you need to do to help you sleep - meditation track, some instructions on the paper etc. 
What if you bought it as a 7-day sleep pack in the supermarket including a sleep mask, and more then later you can get refills in bulk via subscription?
For me it is really important that the packaging in sustainable and eco-friendly, so no single use straws etc. 
I have attached some inspirational packaging images. 1. What made you lean in and take notice? What specific words and/or phrases did you particularly like?How might this concept be improved? 

The word ""Breeze"" because I want to be able to fall asleep like a breeze. I like the use of ""quality"" in reference to sleep. I like the expression 'lay the foundations"" - it implies to me that the drink is taken about 30 min - 1 hour before bedtime as part of a bedtime ritual. I like the ""mind and body"" use here and the implications towards holistic. 

2. How would you rewrite it to make it more compelling? Think about specific words or phrases that you might change.

Remove ""Renew"" - it is too vague, and I think the product names to be more closely associated with sleep and calmness. 

I am also not sure how this milk is being warmed - microwave and/or hob?

Is it high in calories or not? Is it suitable for vegans and people with other dietary requirements?

Where are the quotes from people who have used it?

3. Imagine this almondmilk also had Ashwagandha as an ingredient: what difference would this make to you and why?

I had to google the word ""Ashwagandha"" so I think there needs to be some consumer education on what this is, how it works and who needs to avoid it e.g. breastfeeding Moms. Based on what i have read online, ""yes"" I would take it because there has been peer reviewed studies on this and it does indicate that it is effective. 

One thing that would be a ""no-no"" for me is if this milk contained sugar. 

4. As you can see, the concept above emphasises nourishing and relaxing you before bed from an individual perspective. We have been having conversations about whether it would be better to emphasise other benefits focused more on the family aspect of bedtime.

For me, ""no"", but I think you could mention a ritual for sleep. In the same way you have a coffee in the morning, this is your night ritual. Although, this would have to be sugar-free for my niece/nephew to take it. 

5. What are your thoughts on this? Would an infused almondmilk that was focused on a family nighttime ritual that creates positive bedtime habits be more appealing to you that the concept above? 

For me ""no"" because I am currently single. 1. and 2. The word ""calm"" because it makes this a milk not just for bedtime and sleep but it is also anti-anxiety. I like the fact that it is ABC - Almond Breeze Calm - as simple as the ABCs. But, Almond Breeze Calm is a bit of a mouthful. But, I am not sure what a better combination would be. It does feel like a name for a My Little Pony or one of the toys my niece uses. 

I like the word ""reset"" because this is what I want the product to do. ""Reset"" my mind and body so I can approach challenges with a new perspective. 

“Find yourself a mindful moment” does not read well. I am not sure that “savour” fits and I can’t pinpoint why. 

I like naturally soothing. I don’t need the word delicious. To be honest, I don’t mind if it does not taste that good. 

Of all the words used I like “slow down and lift your mood” the best. I feel like “recenter” and “balanced” feels too much like yoga and has been misused. 

I am not so keen on ""100% pure"" this feels like marketing speak. I think the words used need to be straight to the point. 

3. I would be interested and I would be more likely to buy it because I have not seen it before on products. I think for the same reasons as I mentioned previously
4. Before an interview in my room alone to calm my nerves
Just before I am about to do a presentation in front of an audience during the day. - alone and outside or in the bathroom
30 mins before I go to bed, alone and in the bath or on a walk before bedtime in the woodland near my house
Before I get on a train/flight (or on a train or flight if social distancing allows it)
I  would be alone doing this and would feel like Almond Breeze Calm to either help me to sleep; calm my nerves before a situation where I need to perform; or in a situation where social distancing is challenging and I am in a confined space. I think Calm because I would use it more often and in more situations than Renew. I also don't like to eat much or have a full stomach before bedtime - hence why I use sleep gummies - and I don't know if I would want almond milk before bedtime. This is mainly because I am used to drinking herbal tea before bedtime - camomile and peppermint - but not milky drinks like hot chocolate or horlicks. I also haven't seen that renew is sugar-free either. Are they sugar-free or not?
Are they part of a bedtime ritual or could they be a part of a bedtime ritual? (I find that making and stirring my morning coffee to be as much of a ritual as the coffee itself. Also, the smell of coffee is a huge pull for me. How would this milk smell? Would it smell of lavender?)

I take sleep gummies but sadly they contain sugar so I would like a sugar-free alternative. 
I want to try these ones as well - https://www.sugarbearhair.com/pages/sugarbearsleep_lp1?utm_expid=.MkRfhQRaSh681TWhgBpZqA.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sugarbearhair.com%2F

317602,Josh,Mann,joshmann33@gmail.com,"   The word ""barista"" on the label. I like the option to froth my milk & some (even expensive options) like Rude Health don't froth. They add seaweed to manage the taste for coffee, but it isn't thick enough to steam.

Bright, 'quirky' or 'fun' packaging. Minor Figures don't do much with their packaging which makes it stand out against competitors (less is more). Oatly have the bold balloon typeface which block colour. Rude Health have bright colours. The likes if Alpro are just a bit clinical & traditional for me (even after the rebrand).

Oat milks (or oat drinks) still feel a bit alternative, so i think benefit from a bit more of a challenge brand design. 1) I've had the Oatly Chocolate drink before, which is a great alternative to instant hot chocolate in the winter months, so that would intrigue me.

""Orchard"" highlights the natural plant base of the product.

2) Personally I don't drink whole milk, as there is a perceived high calorie count & that it is unhealthy than semi-skimmed. So the mention of whole milk (whilst this is almondmilk) turns me off.

I understand that each block of text wouldn't appear on the packaging, but there are too many references to ""Rich & Creamy"". It feels like there is nothing else to say about it.

There is a conflict for me between ""Breeze"" (cooling, fresh, light) & ""Rich & Creamy"" (thick, heavy, indulgent).

The reference to ""California"" tells me there are air miles on this product we might not be able to support as a society.

I'm personally looking for something a bit younger & more disruptive, so ""wholesome"" & ""family"" don't resonate with me. I'd rather here about it being a rebellious alternative for my family to unite around. The 2nd resonates most.

The use of the inclusive pronoun ""we"" make me feel more like a part of a community.

I like the inclusion of ""local growers"". For me dairy free milks are part of a 'revolution' so focusing on 'the little guys & 'locals feels important to this in an era of consumerism & globalisation.

Referring to ""Straight from the farm"" let's me conjure up my own version of dairy milk rather than having to be told ""whole milk"".

Mentioning ""plant based"" helps highlight the Hoathly & ethical benefits over dairy without being too overt.

The instruction to close your eyes & picture it is a bit cheesy/kitsch for me.

Not sure about the air miles conjured up by mentioning the Californian origins, but understand that this adds an element of quality & suggests the almonds aren't being harvested by workers with poor labour standards. In all honesty I'm not a fan of the Almond Breeze packaging/branding. For me it's closer to Alpro rather than brands I prefer to buy like Oatly & Minor Figures. I understand that I may not be the target audience & it's personal preference. The copy shown probably wouldn't be seen by me as I probably wouldn't reach for the product unless I was looking to try an 'alternative-alternative milk'.

The ability to froth the milk is important to me, this product hasn't mentioned if this would be possible.

Does it have any other attributes, such as organic, 100 natural, higher almond content than competitors? I haven't been given any real justification to move away from my tried & tested regular purchase. I understand taste is usually the number 1 reasons to repurchase, so at the moment this product would probably need to be discounted on launch to get me to try it.                      2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,INTJ
334691,Kirsten,Riccardi,kirstenriccardi@gmail.com,"            1. Spicy Dill Pickle. I love dill as a flavor and I’m curious how it would be with a spicy twist. I often use dill in my cooking because I crave the flavor so it would be great to have a go-to convenient snack with dill as the bold flavor.
2. I would not say artificially flavored! That immediately made me lose interest. Why does it have to be artificial? I generally lose interest with artificial flavors because they rarely can emulate the real thing plus I get concerned about if they’re safe to consume.
3. I’m not entirely sold on saying Dill Pickle. Dill yes but how can a pickle flavor be added to almond snacks? I’m much more interested in the pure dill. Also, I’m interested in seeing the health benefits printed on the can of almonds! They’re a superior choice over potato chips :) so why not celebrate that fact front and center? 1. The bold range doesn’t feel too groundbreaking. The flavor combinations are ok but nothing too out of the ordinary. The packaging also feels dated to me, and it sort of makes me question how healthy these snack almonds actually are for you.
2. I’ve had the wasabi soy sauce flavor and it was quite good. I bought it because I was craving sushi that day so it was a great alternative! In certain ways my issue with the bold line is that it feels like junk food a bit because they’re quite salty sweet in the way they’re overly coated. They taste good but I’m not convinced I would feel super healthy eating them on a frequent basis. I would want bold flavor without such an increase in salt and sugar. If the texture was more crispy roasted that might satisfy! For example, I buy these twice baked sourdough crackers and they have a really bold flavor without being overly salty.
3. Yes absolutely,  I would love to see more options of flavors in this range. 1. Weekend picnics often call for Kettle Chips.  These potato chips have been a long time guilty pleasure in our family. Now that they cook them in avocado oil we feel a little less guilty :) 

2. The New York Cheddar is a favorite and the Salt and Black Pepper. They’re quite simple but they taste complex. The beauty of quality black pepper is the lemony taste that comes with it.  I would love to see a Sumac snack because that spice really has a lovely citrus tone to it. Also Zaatar chips with a babaganoush would make my day!

3. The texture is what I love the most. They’re thick and SO CRUNCHY. Black pepper is a great flavor that I would really love to have with almonds instead of the constant salty sweet combinations. I also really like the color choices of their bags, the more subtle pastel colors are more appealing to me because somehow it feels more natural and therefore more healthy to eat. 1. Honey Cinnamon Nut Thins. I would be curious to try these! I love honey and cinnamon separately so I definitely leaned in when I was browsing throught that product range. Usually it’s cinnamon with sugar so the concept of honey caught my eye. Plus the fact that they’re an almond flour cracker is really interesting. I’m not gluten free but I often like to try gluten free foods to see if they’re easier on my digestion. 1. They look fantastic!!! I would most certainly be keen on trying them all. Great flavor choices and mention of no artificial flavors.
2. Absolutely yes. I like how these ranges feel more natural. I wish they sold them at my local grocery story so I could taste them. The toasted coconut and dark chocolate sounds great, I love macaroons. The cardamom and apple crisp also sounded delicious. The package design was light and appealing to me as well. I also appreciate the risk in sea salt with blueberry as a choice.  It made me think about why I love blueberry muffins so much and I think it’s because there is almost a salty yet sweet satisfaction in the muffin top that crumbles when you eat it. These ranges appear to have a great choice in flavors while maintaining a natural and healthy undertone. 1. Great color palette and health strategy.  I really like the illustration of how they’re dipped in less chocolate, and yes, very smart to call them “skinny”.  The initial thought about “fun in the sun” though never works with chocolate coated snacks because they melt so easily in your hand! Maybe more like “summertime fun”.

2. Lemon Bliss! I think it’s quite clever to use a happy emotional word like “bliss” associated with the flavor. I instinctively wanted to try these for that reason. I also like the concept of yogurt coated nuts with lemon. It’s as if we’re cutting out the cake but still get to experience the delicious flavor. Almost like “having your cake and eating it too” ;)

3. The clear description used in the US vs THEM chart caught my eye on Skinny Dipped. The real ingredients vs. fake/artificial/flavored stands out to me. I don’t want something flavored, I want to eat the ingredient as it is. The chocolate flavored almond confuses me. Why can’t it be chocolate coated? I also like that Skinny Dipped isn’t afraid to include peanut butter into their range. I get really strong cravings for peanut butter especially with chocolate. At first it seemed strange to add another nut type of flavor to almonds but I think it’s a great idea that definitely gained my attention.  I think what Skinny Dipped does well is the overall cheerful feel of the product design. They really look fun and creative not to mention healthier than the alternative chocolate coated nuts. I could see Blue Diamond having a summertime range that had great appeal... maybe even with characters like they do with Otter Pops. We used to look forward to summer so that we could eat Otter Pops! Granted, they’re high in sugar content so I’ve not had them since I was a kid but they’re a fun way of creating stories and I’m sure there are ways to create a similar theme without the added sugar. 1. I liked words like “adventure”, “healthy”, “brighten my day”,  and “invigorate your senses”. I definitely like the idea of satisfying snacks that have a different flavor profile. 

2. For me, I require a snack when my energy levels are low. They almost rescue me.  I think that could be another way to engage my interest. Also the fact that these almonds are so readily available on the go is a big plus.  Road tripping through life and having almonds by my side feels like an essential item.  Maybe the idea of a staycation can be involved too! Because we’re not always able to take road trips but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy the snacks!

3. Rebel Treats
    Food Fuel
    Beyond Snacks 1. Black Pepper and Cheddar is definitely the one I love the most. I’m not as interested in Maple Bacon because I question where the bacon flavor is coming from. I’m curious about Matcha Mint because I love mint chip ice cream and I love matcha but I don’t know if I would want a snack with a mint taste without the chocolate element.  The Sriracha and Almond Butter is also a bit confusing when I imagine the coated almond. I wonder what color it is and if it’s more of a dipped almond vs a coated almond.  Dark Chocolate and Chilli sounds amazing! I can see myself trying that one after the Black Pepper and Cheddar :)

2. Honestly I think I fall in between these two options.  I don’t want something really classic but I also don’t see myself wanting to eat lavender on a daily basis.  I would be more interested in Saffron or some type of berry.  I just learned about a Swedish berry called a cloudberry which sounds incredible! Sourdough could be an interesting flavor and is something I eat daily.  I am also a big fan of banana and peanut butter and wonder if that’s a possible option. I really enjoy that flavor combination.

3.  Black Pepper and Cheddar, Dark Chocolate and Chilli year round.  Maple Bacon and Matcha Mint are more of a holiday choice in my opinion.  Sriracha and Almond Butter just doesn’t really appeal to me because my experience with almond butter has never reached the height of peanut butter when it comes to that overarching flavor. Maybe almond butter and jam could catch my eye as a form of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in a handful of snacks before branching out to sriracha. I think this range could be pitched as a snack for the adventurous while staying close to home. The idea of a staycation has become very popular and I think this range of snacks can be a great way for people to experience travel without the hassle!  The last line seems backwards to me. I think it makes more sense written: “This snack of roasted whole almonds and dried fruit will naturally satisfy your sweet snack desires with absolutely no added sugars or artificial flavorings!”   I think each word needs a detail associated with it because just “almond” and “fruit” I imagine them to be somewhat raw.  The fact they’re roasted almonds makes a huge difference and the dried fruit also... though dried fruit sometimes has a bit of a dorky stigma attached to it... like it belongs in trail mix only. Maybe “sun dried” fruit? I also have run into the problem of buying dried mango for example and sometimes it has all sorts of added ingredients that I don’t want to consume.  I would want to know that the dried fruit is purely fruit.   Any type of sugar that comes directly from the fruit is absolutely fine with me. Or, honey is acceptable as well. If sugar was to be added, I would prefer a brown sugar or a natural cane sugar in very very small amounts. I’m not a fan of agave or Splenda or these kinds of alternative sweetners at all. Though I always have my eyes peeled for new ways of including sugar, especially because my little brother is diabetic.  I heard about an amazing produce from Peru called Maca that has a low glycemic index but I wouldn’t know how that could be involved in this process at all,  just thought I would share!   I don’t add sugar to my coffee or tea but once in awhile I’ll add one teaspoon of sugar if I make homemade chai.  I wouldn’t want to go beyond that.  In grams that would probably be about 4.   Dusted Almonds! Oven roasted! Nutty Crunch with no added oil! Subtly sweet! Superfood goodness of the almond!   Real food ingredients is still a little weird sounding to me. Maybe just saying “all natural “ would be more appealing.   Fairy Dusted Almonds Moonbeam Almonds Happy Thoughts

I also recently had this delicious fruit paste that I absolutely love. I woudn’t normally think to have cheese and fruit but I know the French eat it for dessert so I gave it a shot and really liked it!

252388,Sachie,Uchimaru,suchimaru@gmail.com,"       I think at this point (with Covid and homeschooling and Black Lives matter and EVERYTHING else going on in 2020) anything that brings me joy and a sense of comfort is going to help me relax. This may be different than if I was asked this question in 2019, when I was more motivated and capable of taking care of my body in a more healthy manner. So things that make me happy re: food are things like matcha, lavender, dark chocolate, salty chocolate chip some reason comes to mind. 1. These following words caught my attention ""drink warm, before bed, relax body before bed, night's sleep, renewed and refreshed"" I like the concept-i think people are so stressed these days with everything going on that many people are having issues falling asleep. So something soothing and naturally relaxing, that is NOT alcohol, would surely be welcomed by all. 

2. I would maybe change the word Renew. That somehow doesn't link with me with sleep and good night's sleep. (Although I get that it's really aiming for the morning after feeling after a good night's sleep). I would find a word that maybe is more associated with the easily falling asleep portion--that's the part that many people with sleep difficulties are longing for. So maybe something like serene, peaceful, tranquil, soothing

3. I would say the same as I did in the page before--but slightly less of a negative reaction. Somehow I associate this new word Ashwagandha more with soothing thing I would eat before bedtime. Maybe I think of a herb?

4. I have mixed feelings--I don't really want my kids to be getting used to drinking or eating something right before bedtime, especially the same thing everyday. I would be nervous about creating a strong association that they would not be able to sleep without it. I would prefer to keep it something that is for adults. 1. I caught the following words ""unpredictable, reliable, balance, any time of day, relax, 100% pure, slow down."" I think it can be improved by adding the idea that it is also healthy for you, because it is protein (right?!) and dairy and gluten free. Like selling the concept that it is a healthy alternative to a snack, a snack that can bring you good feelings (that's why people eat snacks anyway) without the guilt that it is bad for you.

2. A quick pick-me-up at any time of day, whether you're looking for a few moments of calm in the middle of a busy day or to unwind and relax at the end of the day. An 100% almond milk beverage with naturally soothing ingredients that will lift your mood, and give you health benefits as it's protein-packed and dairy and gluten free. 

3. I have no idea what ashwagandha is so it wouldn't really make a difference. It may also make me steer clear of it since it is so foreign. It reminds me of the name of a yoga pose or something, not something you eat or drink to put inside your body. As it's clearly indian it makes me think of curry flavor--something I don't want in almond milk

4. I would probably drink this around 4 or 5pm as I'm trying to unwind as an afternoon break-before the crazy dinner time prep and having the kids get ready for their homework. I am probably hungry a little bit but also stressed from the day at work, so I would have a cup of this to give me some nutrients but not feel guilty about what I'm eating. I'm at home, at my kitchen by myself. I liked both pretty strongly. If I had to pick, I would pick Calm probably because I liked the idea of an alternative to alcohol that I can use as an unwinder, and something that will give me nourishment so I can use as a snack alternative instead of something like potato chips. Especially something as healthy as almond milk because I think of protein when I think of it. REBBL Turmeric Golden Milk

198771,Jeffrey,Abramson,jeff@jeffreyabramson.com,"               Yes. Classic Honey Roasted almonds.  Clean, simple, sweet. I know what I'm getting. there is a comfort/familiarity to it even when presented with more fanciful options.  I looked at the cardamom/honey crisp ones and am curious but too often I am disappointed by attempts to build more complex flavor profiles.  Frankly I saw the ""dark chocolate flavored/toasted coconut"" ones (and i love those tastes) but you lost me at ""flavored"" and then I started to wonder how the other ""almond and fruit"" tastes may be flavored and was compelled to go back to an oldie but goodie (the honey roasted).  But now curious to know more I looked more deeply at the ingredients for the chocolate/coconut ones and find they have stevia and that's an immediate no for me.  Meanwhile the ingredients for the ""cardamon/honeycrisp"" look quite compelling - real apple, brown sugar, cardamom, molasses.  I'd probably give that a try.   Also I like the Blue Diamond gourmet savory flavors (I've bought them from time to time, usually at airports I think) but since this exercise is about sweet stuff, I skipped over that.  

Meanwhile packaging. If you upgrade the packaging for the honey roasted almonds from a can to a resealable bag, I'd be more likely to get them. 1. In theory I like the concept of the oven-roasted range but the only version that checks out for me ingredient wise is ""sea salt"" . . . all the others have questionable ingredients such as ""blueberry flavor"" or in the case of ""toasted coconut,"" coconut isn't even an ingredient (unless it's buried in ""spice"").  For ""Almond & Fruit"" I answered in my last question I believe.  

2. I would have grabbed "" dark chocolate flavored/coconut"" but don't think I'd be happy, I think I would end up liking the cardamom/honeycrisp ones, again simply because of ingredients.  

Ultimately if you really want my attention - cover the almonds in real dark chocolate and then add a variety of real powder spices to those. I get that I'm trying to reduce the sugar here but I guess when push comes to shove, I rather have the sugar than fake ingredients. 1. Um yea. this is what I was just talking about.  lightly dipped, real ingredients. some sweet, some tangy. Calories counted by # of almonds (not some obscure weight I'll never be able to track). 

2. I immediately jumped to ""lemon bliss"" - as I imagine they will taste like my mother-in-law's lemon cookies that I love to suck on (yep, I'm the ""suck with my sweet tooth"" guy from the last exercise.  I don't love that the base coating is ""yogurt"" as I'm a little light on dairy and yogurt covered nuts and I have always had a love/hate relationship (usually hate if I eat too many) . . . but I'm into the flavor profile and feel like it's different than what I'd get anywhere else. ie - if I'm really vibing dark chocolate, I can just eat some dark chocolate (and even toss some almonds in my mouth with it).  

3. What to learn from Skinny Dipped? 1. ingredients (i'm sure that's clear now). 2 dip it/coat it (don't dust it), dusted also makes for a less pleasant eating experience, having to wipe my hands on something afterwards.  3. dip it lightly - I love how they show how thin their layer is . .. . just the right amount to give the nut some pizzaz.  Also they have a good backstory but not much you can do there. the packaging is very clean as well and as I mentioned above - help me count calories by the # of almonds (not weight).     OK so these basically sound like breakfast cereal or gorp.  I'm not loving it, starting with the ingredients. Sounds too sweet. I can't even conceptualize if this is a mix of both nuts and fruit or if the almonds are somehow flavored like those things.  So that's a problem but imagine the package would show me with an image or a window.  Same issues with the last one about asterisk after sugar (and anything else similar that I didn't like). assuming its more of a mix of almonds and dried fruit ok - now that i think more about that I'm really into it - but I don't like ""honeycrisp"" apple. . . the honey part is too sweet.  but it's basically like a two-fer - almond + one other healthy complementary taste.  My opinion is turning now but I'm exposing my process here.  at first I imagined them as flavored this way but now I think I get the concept and I'm into it for sure.  
   It's like cereal. which is hearty and a mix of tastes, not the worst thing now that I think about it ""Almond and Dried Fruit"" may be better.   I like my ""two-fer"" thought . . so maybe ""Almond Buddies"" or maybe it's more a tagline  ""two tastes and textures""   
   whatever I said before - anything but stevia?   equiv of 1/2 tablespoon of agave per serving   Looking over it at a glance I was drawn to the available flavors and they are some of my favorites.  So that drew me in first and foremost.  Then I went to the top and started reading.  Overall it sounds wholesome and simple and earthy. I like all that.  I was drawn to the word pure and liked ""an honest, sweet snack I can feel good about.  I like ""nutty crunch"" (the crunch of roasted almonds is very pleasing) and ""no added oil"" (as you rarely see that when getting nut products).  ""real food"" is appealing and I like ""subtly sweet"" and ""superfood goodness""   OK so personally ""dusted"" is a turn off to me. It makes me feel like the product will be messy. Like I better have a paper towel with me while i eat it. ""dust"" gets on things, also ""dust"" is generally considered a dirty thing.  I'm having a hard time thinking of a replacement, I get that ""coated"" makes it seem ""dipped"" in something. maybe ""lightly coated"" or ""brushed with"" or more descriptive like ""kissed by"" or ""tickled with.""   
 I don't like ""delicious"" - if you are being honest and straight forward, let me the judge of whether they are ""delicious"" or not - I may like them plenty, feel fulfilled by them but ""delicious"" is saved for very few things. I'd prefer ""tasty.""   
 Don't like the whole ""no added sugars*"" - the second you put an asterisk on it - I'm thinking . . . ok there is a caveat here to the ""no added sugars"" - so clearly there ARE added sugars - they are just naturally derived.  so just say that straight up . . . ""a subtly sweet mouthful with only a hint of natural fruit-derived sugars"" 
 also I don't like ""mouthful"" - because I'm a ""one almond"" at a time type of guy. I like to put one almond in my mouth and let it roll around - get the outer flavor off it and then slowly crack into it as it breaks down a bit. Almonds are high in calories so I'm mindful of my intact. they are a precious snack.  ""mouthful"" and healthy lifestyle don't  go together in my book. ""mouthful"" makes me think of ""I can't get enough - stuff my mouth.""  anyway you get it. just say ""snack"" or something similar.   well first of all - Blue Diamond is so ubiquitous with almonds it almost seems generic.  I'm sure no brand wants to hear that. but when I see Blue Diamond on the shelf it comes across to me almost like the store brand. so personally I'd leave it out of the name and minimize it in branding or use a different logo.  OK so since I don't like ""dusted"" I gotta think about this. Leaning into the flavors and what appeals to me . . .   Earthy Almonds  Spice & Crunch Almonds Use a tagline or graphic to call out the sweetness ""Subtly Sweet!"" 
  2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""I think I covered quite a bit of my thinking about the concepts in my answers. nothing new is coming to mind. I mean i definitely think the ""almond yogurt"" covered yogursts is unique. at least new to me.  

Probably the most relatable product I got recently was Trader Joe's Bazaar Basket Snack Mix https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/5512

198777,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"   Some sort of packaging that explicitly states 'As creamy as milk.' Maybe a picture of a curious cow. 1. ""Rich and creamy"" makes me lean in, specifically. Also, the acknowledgment that plant-based milks can be too thin. 

2. I'm really happy with the ""rich, creamy, wholesome,"" words that convey very dairy milk-based ideas. All of the phrasing works for me, but I guess what I feel like I'm missing is the idea that plant-based milks -- or this milk in particular -- shares a similar nutritional profile. Dairy milk (and soy milk) both have almost equal amounts of protein, after all, so almond milk frequently falls short in that area. I like Concept 3 the most because it's family-centric, health focused and doesn't use the word ""thick"" in any of the copy to describe the consistency of the almond milk. I don't know that I'm crazy about that term in liquids unless I'm talking about milkshakes. I might've mentioned this earlier but a big part of picking which type of non-dairy milk to buy is learning about the nutritional profile. In general, I really like Silk non-dairy products -- both their soy milk and nut milks are really good. Soy milk has a fair amount of protein but when I can find it, I always get their almond and cashew nut milk with 8g of protein per serving. They include pea protein, which might not be to everyone's taste, but it makes the nut milk taste creamier and I get a non-dairy milk that is approximately the same as dairy milk in terms of protein.

In short, if I see on the packaging ""Same amount of protein as dairy milk but with half the fat!"" (or whatever), I'm automatically *very* interested.                      2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,
325502,Dennis,Grant,grantden@gmail.com,"            I went to the crafted snack almond area of the website and I found a few different offerings I would try. In the almonds and fruit category, I would try the ghost pepper and tart cherry, the honey apple flavor as well as the blueberry flavor. On the gourmet side, I’d honestly give them all a go and even mix them amongst the almond and fruit pairings to create my own trail mix. The flavor possibilities definitely made me curious and also the ability to pair sweet with savory. I would wonder if blue diamond would offer a premixed bag of the gourmet with the almond and fruit to see what combinations may taste good. Those flavors definitely have potential! I personally haven’t seen almonds done to this extent yet so I would try these. I gravitated towards the habanero/bbq, salt/vinegar and the sweet dill flavors. Again, I’m thinking of pairing the sweet with the savory so I would still reach for the almond/fruit offerings and put them together to see what kind of concoction I could create. I think the mash up flavors would be right up my alley as a possibility. Ruffles chips when I comes to snacks! They put out some of the wackiest flavors that I can recall as it pertains to snacks and some of them actually taste good. I just like that Ruffles steps out the box regularly with their chips and it does stand out from the rest. The chicken and waffles chips were real good when they had them available a few years back. I think blue diamond may be on the right page with expanding the flavor base of their nuts and they should keep offering flavors you wouldn’t ordinarily find, even if they are for a limited time. Test the market and allow the people to vote and then you can’t go wrong.    1) The first sentence is what I focused on initially because it described the “person” who would be interested in trying these new flavors and it did a good job outlining why they would enjoy these bold offerings. The line that said “many of the interesting flavors that catch my eye are in junk food” was very key to me because I feel that way as well. I also gravitated towards the second paragraph under the description that outlined the ingredients of the almonds because it gave me further insight into the health minded composition of the snacks in general. 

2) I would improve by adding some visuals to the concepts. People unknowingly gravitate towards color and colors like green and bright reds are engaging. I would at least make the pictures of the actual flavor look cool and colorful especially since the word bold is apart of this product range. Bold should be represented in imagery to allow the actual written word to not appear redundant. 

3) I would name it X-Flavours. X will stand for extreme but also have a x men connotation in the sense that these flavors are different from
the original. 1) All the flavors listed would at least peek my interest in looking at the product in general. I wouldn’t do the chocolate/chilli  and that mint one but the remaining ones I’d give a shot. I’m not a huge chocolate person and the mint sounds like it’ll be overpowering in almond form to me. 

2) That mango/Taijin sounds wonderful! I would lean more towards the exotic side than the classic and again if it was possible, do limited runs of stuff too to see how it’s received in market. Sweet stuff like strawberry lemonade or the mango taijin would be ones I would eat regularly as well as savory stuff like chicken and waffles. 

3) Maple bacon and black pepper/cheddar I could see as staple flavors. The sriracha and almond butter seems to be a fall/winter holiday flavor as well as the chocolate and mint. Think even more out the box and seasonally. Spring could have more sweet, jelly bean like pairings and also think internationally too as far as flavor combo. Incorporate curry.        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,INTJ
313400,Alejandra,Garcia,lalelugo@gmail.com,"            Yes, actually, I'd like to try all of them. The classic products will never loose their strength. I believe they are there to offer the basic experience of almonds, be it in snacks, crackers, milk, or yogurt, I'd give them a go without hesitating. I think their packaging is cool since the use of different colors differentiate them from one flavor or another. Perhaps a mix of all the classic almonds could be a nice product to have all combinations in one can.

As for the newest product, almond and fruit, it seems just perfect. My mouth is watering while I'm writing these lines because they seem irresistible. I'd love to try them now. I seek for healthy combinations to snack and these are great. Being the sweet or salty options, I just picture them in my breakfasts or lunches. Nicely done! And the same word of advice for this presentation, it may be a great idea to have a bag with a mix of all the flavors to have all the flavors at hand in one bag.

Regarding Almond Breeze, I'd lean in the unsweetened products because I've tried quite sweet almond milk and I just don't like it. So, the flavors seem fine to me due to all the possible combinations you can get in smoothies, milkshakes, and so on. For the yogurt, it's the same, I'd have it in the morning or for an evening sweet snack provided it's not that sweet.

Finally, I'd also pick all the different crackers flavors since they're perfect for accompanying me while working, chilling, watching series, or for a family gathering. What BD could do better is offering a big pack with all different flavors to make even greater combinations or just for having an option for the ones who love variety in one pack. It seems interesting but the packaging is quite classical. If you look at the tradictional flavors, what makes them classical, appart form their taste, is their packaging. So, I'd go bolder to create a new one for this range. 

I'm not pretty sure if I'd lean in these combinations because I already associate  almonds with a healthy food and seeing the 'artificially flavored' words confused me. Perhaps just adding the ingredient and indicating it as almonds AND garlic, or other ingredient, would be better. The flavors seem adventurous but that 'artificially' is stopping me from choosing them.

Yes, I thought of almonds and powder chilli, cardamom, curcuma, ginger, cinnamon, garlic, parsley, oregano but rather than including the artificial flavor it could just be adding the spices. Glico Pokis are biscuit sticks with wonderful flavors: cookies n' cream, matcha, banana chocolate, strawberry, chocolate, etc. They're made in Thailand and where I live they're not that easy to find, but I love them. My favs are strawberry and matcha and it's their size, smell, and flavor that make me want to keep eating them. I could also once try a cherry Kit Kat chocolate from Japan and it was delicious. What amazed me was the combination of chocolate and its filling, it was so tasty. So, I think Blue Diamond needs to stick to their wonderful almond flavor and make sure that the almond + whatever combinaton they go with entice the consumers into their irresistible texture, smell, flavor, presentation. They need to be luring and prove that love enters through the eye but it is flavor that conquers your heart.    1. ... challenge your taste buds; flavours that wow my taste buds; excitingly bold

2. I wouldn't mention the line: 'Many of the bold flavours that catch my eye are in junk food' I'd only mention the next line without the 'still' there, just like: I'm looking for healthier snacks that gives me an excitingly bold flavor experience'. The rest is cool. 

3. Intrepid Almonds 1. Maple bacon seems interesting, just thinking about the deliciousness of bacon combined with a touch of maple makes me mouthwater. Black pepper and cheddar made me think of Britain because cheddar cheese is very popular there and although they don't sound that luring, I'd like to give them a go. Dark chocolate and chilli sounds bold, daring, I'd like to have then just now. Sriracha & almond butter is new to me so I'd choose them to be the last to try, just out of curiosity. Finally, Matcha mint sounds weird, so I'd give them a try without hesitation.

2. If these new flavors are bold, I wouldn't put any classic ones in here. I'd go for the innovative combinations that dare consumers to make them a classic product in the long run because they would be wow! So, exotic flavors are definitely better. Apple lavender, mango tajin sound great! Also, it could be agave honey with tamarind, apricot with chilli powder, pesto almonds, tangerine and cantaloupe, goat cheese and strawberry...

3. Here for the flavors I would like to see on shelf all year round I'd choose chocolate and sea salt, it's a wonderful taste, the classic ones with red fruit (cranberry, blueberry, strawberry, raspberry) and perhaps flavors mixing herbs like lavender, rosemary, thyme. For the seasonal offer or limited edition I'd choose exotic fruit combinations like maracuya, star fruit or special flavours for different events around the year: superbowl, Christmas, etc... I'd stick to the 'naturally flavored' phrase and leave 'artificially flavored' because even though I didn't hear any of artificiality in this activity, I saw that legend in the first activity and that put me off the possibility of buying flavors containing it.        2&BG2&""&BH2&""&BJ2&""&BK2&""&BL2&""&BM&""",Cypher,ENFP
381560,Tom,Pastre,tpastre@optonline.net,"               Dark Chocolate Flavored Almonds & Toasted Coconut. Seems like a good combination of flavors that would make for a good sweet snack. The problem for me is that the product is part of the Almond & fruit range. I don't think of coconut as a fruit so there is a disconnect for me. Plus I don't find the Almond & fruit concept that appealing. I don't want to eat almonds with Tart Cherry, Whole Blueberry, or Honeycrisp Apple. However I do find Fiery Ghost Pepper and Sweet Cardamom appealing - perhaps paired with dark chocolate.  

What can Blue Diamond be doing better to provide a healthier sweet snack? -- Not sure which sweet flavors but the concept should mimic Hint water- natural with just a hint of sweetness/flavor. I pretty much answered these questions in the last segment.

The Oven Roasted range is confusing to me. Unless I'm missing it, they don't explain what makes ""oven roasted"" different and better - what is the benefit? Plus there doesn't seem to be a theme with the varieties - blueberry, chocolate, sea salt, coconut? 

I mentioned previously that I'd choose Dark Chocolate & Toasted Coconut - it's the only product that sounds completely appealing to me, EXCEPT, it has added sugar - so it isn't perfect. 1. I like the name and concept. It's like Hint water which I mentioned previously. Although Skinny Dipped is not low sugar and the products are probably not healthier than Blue Diamond's products  Skinny Dipped says ""not a lot of sugar"" and ""no sugar alternatives"" -- not really as healthy as they are suggesting. ""Real Ingredients"" is good - implies clean label. ""Ethically sourced artisan"" chocolate checks a couple of on-trend attributes - sustainability, high quality.  Plant protein call-out is also on trend. 

What could be better? - package graphics - at least online, the product on the bag does not look like it's been skinny dipped or that it has ""a super thin layer of dark chocolate"". Looks to me like it has a thick coating.

2. Super Dark + Sea Salt - I like both ingredients. The call-out of 73% artisan dark chocolate is appealing. It has added sugars so not good because of that, but definitely an indulgent treat.   

3. Skinny Dipped is much more transparent than Blue Diamond about its process, ingredients, and benefits. Also calls out attributes consumers desire. Blue Diamond should take note of this.     They are positioning it as a sweet snack for your sweet snack obsession - I don't think of fruit filling that obsession. They don't mention healthier anywhere. Perhaps it should be a healthier way to indulge your sweet tooth with natural sweetness from real fruit.
   I think it's ok. Not very clever but straightforward might work. 
 
   The monkfruit and naturally occurring fruit sugars are ok.
   under 10 g and preferably under 5 per serving
   I like the concept. The headline is appealing - makes my mouth water. 
 Dusted is appealing. 
 So is cacao instead of chocolate. 
 
 Real food ingredients is on trend.
   I'm not sure the reason for being (why would I be interested) makes sense - it's based on sweet snacking but the headline isn't describing sweetness - it's describing new flavor experiences for almonds.
   Dusted Almonds is probably fine. Although I would go back to me prior response - Blue Diamond Pleasures or maybe Delights

230593,Jacqueline,Travaglia,jacqueline_travaglia@hotmail.com,"These three items are really important to me.

Firstly the weights represent me as I am a very active person. I own weights and have a Pole installed at my home, I go to the gym, dance classes, sail, hike, walk the dogs, garden, camp, kayak, paddle board and cycle. I also follow workout videos on youtube and Amazon. I love being active and I do an active activity every day. I find it relaxing and love the way I feel afterwards.

Secondly the Passport represents me to a tea. I haven't gone for more than a fortnight in the last 12 years without catching a plane somewhere. I have homes in Melbourne, Gold Coast and Cookham and a base in LA too. I live amongst all those cities and also travel extensively. My main base is the UK as my 2 dogs, cat and boyfriend live with me. I have lived in the UK since 2000. I can't stop travelling, I think it is the best education a person can receive. I will never stop learning. The more I travle, the more friends I acquire and the more invitations I receive to travel overseas!

Thirdly is my 3D printed brain. One of the businesses I own is a ghost tour business- I love ghost hunting. The brain represents this. The brain also represents technology. I love keeping up to date with the latest technology so when I found out my friend had a 3D printer, I had to go to his house and ask him to print me a brain. I also love the TV Program Black Mirror- the brain represents this for me too. It was long life, unsweetened Almond Breeze

I had Almond Breeze for breakfast with granola this morning- it followed me around the house as I was getting ready for the day and working. I have Almond Breeze with Granola or porridge every other day when I am home in UK or Australia. Most days I have breakfast alone around 7am- I eat while I am doing things. The bowl follows me from the bathroom to the bedroom to my study along with a cup of black coffee. Sometimes I have breakfast with my boyfriend if he has a later start to the day. When we have breakfast together, we sit down at a table and I make him porridge or granola with Almond Breeze (even though he prefers cows milk- but it doesn't bother him with granola or porridge).

Around 1030am I was after a snack so made an Almond Breeze and banana smoothie with my magic bullet. I was alone and drank the smoothie in my study while working. I have one of these smoothies every other day when I am hungy. Sometimes I use protein powder instead of a banana. If I have friends visiting, I make them one too.

At 3pm I felt like a little pick me up and treat so had a black coffee with Almond Breeze and a sugar- this is a treat for me. I try to stick to black coffee. I was gardening and clipping my dogs hair while sipping on my coffee. I have Almond Breeze in black coffee every other day as a treat only.

630pm was dinner time and I wanted to replicate a lovely mushroom stroganoff that I had at local pub a few weeks' ago. I have used Almond Breeze, mushrooms, parsley, flour, veggie stock, onions, paprika, garlic. Sadly it wasn't tasting rich enough so I added cream (even though I prefer not to) It is now delicious. I am eating while writing this! I have left some for my boyfriend to  eat when he gets back from the gym.  I cook with Almond Milk once a week. I use it in curries, pasta sauces, quiches and cake mixes. I do find I usually have to add coconut milk, cream or a little mik to make it creamy and taste richer. If I have a dinner party, it is too risky an ingredient to cook with as it doesn't always taste great in recipes. I will cook with it for my boyfriend and me but I stick to what I know when entertaining.   Unfortunately I am not that locked into the brand that it would have any impact on me. If Almond Breeze did not exist, I would just buy another brand of Almond Milk. In a blind taste test, I could not distinguish the difference.

If there was no Almond Milk, I would switch to Rice Milk, Oat Milk and Coconut Milk. I feel the non milk alternatives are fairly similar. The taste is a bit different but I don't drink them straight, they are always mixed with something e.g. granola or fruit. I would never drink soy milk though-  I believe it is unhealthy and the taste is stronger than other non dairy alternatives- for me it ruins the flavour or anything it is mixed with.

If there were no non dairy alternatives, I would feel:

Unhealthy, fat, fatigued

The reason for this is I would drink cow's milk if there were non non dairy alternatives. I would even drink cow's milk over soya milk. Cow's milk is designed to triple a calf's weight over a 12 month period- imagine what this does to a human! Cow's milk makes humans feel bloated and fatigued. It also increases weight gain. Great for active bodybuilders or children but not for a regular adult. Dairy also causes inflammation of joints, overstimulates oil glands which causes acne and inhibits iron absorption. It is not healthy for an adult to consume dairy. However, I would consume it in small doses if there was no alternative as I love granola and creamy smoothies!!! I also love creamy dishes such as curries and pasta sauces.

I have created a mood board in a life without milk alternatives (other than soya- which I wouldn't consume). Without milk alternatives I would drink and cook with cows milk. I would feel very fatigued and run down and find it hard to focus on tasks due to the sleepiness. I would fart a lot- I noticed people who drink a lot of dairy seem to! This would make me feel uncomfortable and anxious in public situations. I would have bad skin and a bloated stomach- making me feel self- conscious about my physical appearance in public, at the gym, in bikinis and when I am booked for modelling jobs. I would also feel guilty- over the stress and harm I cause to cows and the environment due to grazing. I think consuming large amounts of cows milk would change my personality!

I might therefore not even switch to cows milk at all- which would then mean that I would eat granola and porridge with water only and I would only have fruit smoothies and non creamy sauces. This would change the way I pereceive and interact with food. Cooking and eating would become just a task I need to complete as opposed to something I look forward to and enjoy. Creamy food and drink is a mini indulgence for me- skipping this takes out all my treats. I wouldn't feel treated! ",Cupid,
326407,Courtney,Bogue,crs4891@gmail.com,"My daughter is the most important person in my life and makes me happy. I love cooking and baking so I'm using my oven all the time. Lastly, my espresso machine is important because I use it every day and coffee is a big part of my life.  I normally use Silk Unsweetened, sometimes I get the Unsweetened Vanilla. The kind I was using for this map was Silk Unsweetened. I use it most in the morning for breakfast or for cooking. My daughter is usually using it for the same things or eating with me. I'd say we use it an average of 2-3 times per day, so 14-21 times per week for various things. My favorite way to use Silk is in my iced coffee drinks because its creamy and light. I make and chill my espresso, add any flavorings, then add Silk to finish it. I prefer it very cold but in the cold months I do steam it and make warm coffee drinks with it. I feel good after consuming Silk because its light and doesn't feel heavy afterwards. I am most happy about the quality of Silk compared to other brands. I do also enjoy the packaging; it is eye catching and recognizable. I see the most advertisements for Silk too.  Unhappy, unsatisfied, bored. My visual is my thoughts I was thinking when imagining that Silk no longer existed. My main points are circles and they connect to secondary points.",Cupid,
326412,Mohini,Banerjee,mohinic@gmail.com,"The first picture represents travel. Traveling is important to me because it gives me a sense of how small we are and how little we know compared to the big, beautiful, diverse world around us. Every time I go to a new county, meet new people, eat new food and have new experiences, I learn something new and grow as a person. It opens my eyes to situations I had never thought of before and makes me realize there is so much more to life than just waking up each morning and going to bed at night! Taking a vacation every few months is as important as breathing - it adds life to my soul. 

The second picture is of my guinea pigs and they are important to me because they give me something to look forward to each day. Their sweet, loving squeaks when I wake up in the morning and their furry little kisses when I cuddle them before going to bed fills my heart with warmth and takes all the stress of the day away. They are like free, furry therapy! I love taking care of them and treating them like my babies. They give me a break from the hustle and bustle of every day life and remind me that sometimes, the smallest things take up the biggest room in your heart.

The third picture is of books and books are important to me because they're like a magic carpet; they can transport me to another world, another era, another dimension whenever I please. Every time I read a book, it's like I experience a whole new life along with the characters of the book, right from the comfort of my armchair. I carry a book with me when I travel, to doctor's appointments, when I commute and everywhere else because then, I am never alone. I always have the characters and the story and their adventures to keep me company. I could be in the most boring situation, and yet I could never be bored because I'm hanging on to the last few pages of a thrilling mystery or crying in happiness because two people finally found love or marveling at historical facts in my book. Books are friends for life.  2. Silk Unsweetened Vanilla almond milk

3. I use almond milk as a creamer in my coffee. as an accompaniment to my cereal, as a base for desserts, as a creamer in my tea and to mix hot cocoa in. I also use to make overnight oats, where I soak oats and almond butter with almond milk overnight and then top it with fruits and nuts in the morning. During festive occasions, I use almond milk to make Indian sweets. When I go on week-long diets, I have a glass of almond milk whenever I feel hungry, as a filler in between meals as a healthy snack.
a) The moments are when I have my morning coffee, that's first thing in the morning and when I have breakfast, that is later in the morning after my workout. I sometimes have dessert that is almond-milk based like rice puddings or fruit custards after lunch at work. In the evening when I get home from work, I have a masala chai tea made with almond milk. At times, I also have hot cocoa with marshmallows and almond milk right before I go to bed. 
b) I have my coffee and breakfast in my apartment's balcony. I am alone during those times. I have my lunch at my desk at work, I have a coworker who has lunch with me. I have my evening tea on the couch at home or out in the balcony depending on the weather and my husband joins me. I have the hot cocoa on the couch while watching movies with my husband or sitting at my home work desk when I finish up some work by myself.  
c) The coffee, breakfast and evening tea happens every day of the week.  The others change depending on what I'm having for lunch/dinner or if I'm in the mood for dessert/cocoa or not, so maybe a few times a week 1) I most enjoy having Silk almond milk with Quaker granola cereal for breakfast. Cold and creamy, it tastes best with crunchy bits of granola, first thing in the morning. 
2) a. I take some Quaker granola in a bowl, pour 1/2 a cup of Silk almond milk in the bowl and top it with fruits and nuts.
b. I prefer to have it cold. I do make some exceptions though, for example while having hot cocoa, I like it steaming hot. I feel like it tastes best when cold though.
3) I always measure it, to make sure I know how many calories I'm consuming and to recreate every dish the exact same way, each time I make it. 
4) Full, satiated and yet not bloated. Also, I feel guilt-free because it's healthy and humane to animals.
5) I like its packaging because the twist cap ensures a non-messy pour every time. I also like that it is not plastic, so it doesn't harm the environment. Lastly, I like its size and shape because it fits perfectly in the door of my fridge.  1) Frustrated, upset and tired. The reason I have chosen these is because:

Frustrated: It takes a while to try different brands and find one that you truly love and enjoy having. Now that I have found my favorite almond milk brand, Silk, I definitely would want to continue repurchasing it. I feel frustrated imagining a world without silk because I have to start from scratch all over again and find a new brand I like as much as Silk.
Upset: I am a person who loves routine and a sense of familiarity. I do not like changes, however big or small. Even little things that I am forced to change in my lifestyle and diet make me upset. Since I have Silk every single day, having it missing from my daily life would make me upset. 
Tired: One of the reasons I love Silk is because it never fails to energize me, without making me feel guilty about calories. The thought of not having a glass of chilled Silk before my workout to motivate and energize me makes me feel tired and lethargic.",Cupid,
326413,Charlotte,Pawley,Charlotterose130@gmail.com,"I chose headphones, my TV, and a framed photo to represent who I am. The photo of a pair of cows was taken at my favorite animal sanctuary, representing my love for animals, but also because this sanctuary is what inspired me to live a vegan lifestyle and this photo serves as a beautiful reminder of that. The TV because I work in the television industry every day, and believe in TV as a vessel for so much more than entertainment. And my wireless gym headphones represent my love for both music and keeping a healthy active life at the gym.  Not sure if I'm getting this ""map"" idea right..! It shows an example of what a typical 24 hour period can be for me.
2. I usually drink unsweetened vanilla almond milk, sometimes I buy other varieties like unsweetened original or the almond/cashew blend I currently have. 
3. In a typical day, I have it in coffee in the morning while I work at my desk. I will sometimes have a glass with dinner or dessert at home, either eating with other people or if not, usually watching TV. And I often have some late at night with a snack at home by myself, watching tv or a movie as well. I have it in coffee almost every weekday, a full glass I have less often - maybe twice a week, and a late night snack 3 or 4 times a week.
Aside from this 24 hour period, the other many ways I enjoy it are in oatmeal, in smoothies, with protein powder, in baked goods, and even in some kinds of cream sauces for pasta, etc. I think for me I most enjoy it with cereal. I have always been a big cereal eater, at any time of day, and so when I started using plant-based milk options it took me a while to find out that really worked as a replacement with a smooth enough taste and not too much of a nut flavor. So I really enjoy having it with cereal, and I do think temperature makes a difference because I prefer it to be super cold, it just tastes that much more refreshing. In terms of rituals for preparing it, no, nothing really comes to mind. I feel good and sort of light after consuming it, my body feels noticeably better than when I’d have dairy products. Beyond it’s tsste I really do appreciate the sustainability efforts from Silk. It’s becoming increasingly important in today’s environmental situation so I can feel confident that the brand makes an effort to conserve water, use recyclable packaging, etc.  Disappointed, overwhelmed, hopeful. Obviously I’m disappointed because it’s my favorite brand and it’s a product/line of products I consume very regularly. I’m overwhelmed by the other options on the market because I don’t have any brand loyalties other than Silk and I haven’t found any that I like as much or that are as accessible. I’m hopeful however because I don’t want my feelings to be ALL negative, this is still an opportunity to try what else is out there and explore different brands and potentially new favorites. Plus I’m comforted by the fact that dairy alternatives are still growing and becoming more and more plenty as well as refined. 
I’m uploading a little mood board/collage I made to represent this. It’s silly but it shows I’m a little upset without my favorite product. I’m also overwhelmed by all the options and the feeling of starting from square one, a little lost among the choices. That’s probably the most prominent idea here. And generally indifferent to what I’ve so far tried but determined to continue.",Cupid,
326414,Mallory,Jacobson,malloryevans25@gmail.com,"The three items that I chose represent several aspects of who I am. The photo of a treadmill symbolizes the importance I place on exercise and fitness. I enjoy leading an active lifestyle, and working out makes me feel good and keeps me healthy. The photo of books reveals that I love reading. Reading a book is both relaxing and entertaining for me, and helps me to wind down after a stressful day. I also chose a photo of a smoothie bowl because this is one of my favorite dishes to enjoy as a meal or as a snack. I like making smoothie bowls with nutritious fruits and vegetables, and add other various ingredients such as yogurt, almond milk, nuts, and granola. It's the perfect thing to eat before or after a workout because it is refreshing but not too heavy.  1. Over a 24 period, I enjoyed having Silk almond milk two times. The first was in my morning smoothie, which is shown in the attached photo. I made a nutritious smoothie with mango, spinach, almond milk, and a splash of orange juice. The second time I used almond milk was in the afternoon- I poured a splash of almond milk into my iced coffee.

2. It is the Silk Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. It is 30 calories per serving. It is slightly sweet, but not too sweet.

3. 
a. I often consume Silk in the mornings, either in a smoothie as shown in the picture, or in a bowl of cereal. I also enjoy using it in my iced coffee, which I drink either in the morning or in the afternoon. 

b. Most often, I enjoy Silk at home. I always make sure to have Silk in my refrigerator since I use it so frequently. My husband is normally with me, and he uses Silk as well.

c. Over the course of a week, I consume Silk almond milk between 10-12 times. 1. I most enjoy having Silk when it is very cold and was just taken out of the refrigerator. 

2. 
a. When it's at its best, I consume silk in fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies, in cereal such as granola or Special K, and in my iced coffee in the mornings and afternoons. 
b. Temperature is very important. Like I mentioned, I prefer it to be very cold and just taken out of the refrigerator. I would never consider using it if it was not very cold or if it had reached room temperature.

3. No, I do not have any rituals for how I prepare and consume it.

4. Once I consume it, I feel satiated. Using it in healthy snacks and small meals makes me feel energized and ready to take on the day rather than too full or sluggish.

5. While it is appealing, there is nothing incredibly special about the branding or messaging; in fact, it looks quite similar to that of other almond milk brands. I just find that the taste and texture of the product is my favorite so far.  1. If Silk did not exist, I would have to purchase a product from another brand of almond milk. While I have tried others and I find them to be adequate, I do not enjoy them as much as I enjoy Silk. And I truly do not enjoy drinking cow's milk, so that would be out of the question.

2. I pictured a grocery store where the dairy area was only filled with containers of cow's milk. I have attached a photo for reference. Walking into a grocery store and seeing that there is no Silk available for purchase would be upsetting for me because I purchase it very often and use it multiple times each day. 

3. ""No Silk almond milk? Cow's milk only? Will I have to eat my cereal dry from now on, drink my coffee black and bitter, and have smoothies that are tart instead of creamy? This is a catastrophe! I need my Silk!""",Cupid,
326415,Stephanie,Schick,stephaniejschick3@gmail.com,"Picture 1: I am a runner! I love excersize and pushing my  body. I have been an athlete my entire life and this past April I ran the Boston Marathon. I had been battling health issues for the whole year but had the qualifiying time, so two days before the race I decided to show up and do it without training. Somehow the crowds and the environment helped me run the whole thing.

Picture 2: Two years ago I did a IronMan. It was a lifelong goal of mine. This picture also represents the relationship I have with my twin sister, who also does IronMan. She has been extremely successful, and we definitely bonded through training together. I have had to stop due to health issues, but triathlon and endurance events is a bond that holds my family together. We are extreme!

Picture 3:I went to a Quaker boarding school where I learned the most about myself and others. To this day, it has shaped who I am. Here is a picture of my best friends at our five year reunion.  I get the almond and cashew blend with added pea protein. Its 130 cals per serving, unsweetened, and SUPER CREAMY! I love the added protein and it makes me fuller.
I take it every single day in my coffee in the morning. After my gym work out, I often use it to make a protein smoothie with protein powder, milk, spinach, turmeric, and occasionally fruit. Topped with cacao nibs and maca powder. 
I am always at home when I drink my Silk, and most of the time alone (unless my boyfriend is over). 
This happens every day, so 7 times a week! I enjoy it mostly in my coffee. I often cannot even drink my coffee with out it! I have some stomach problems, and adding the Silk milk to my coffee makes it easier on my stomach and digestion. It also makes it taste much better. 
I crave it more in the mornings and if I am having a sweeter lunch. At breakfast, I almost always have it in my coffee or in my smoothie. If I am coming off of a work out, I always put it in my protein shake. I have a lot of dietary restrictions, and having the option of a really good plant based milk has been a game changer! I have even put it in some baked goods as well!
I do not have any crazy rituals, however in my coffee, when I want it to be frothy, I put the coffee and Silk in a blender before drinking it and it blends super well :) 
Silk is very easy to digest and I feel good after consuming it! I find that the added protein in the Silk that I buy is very satisfying and filling. 
I most appreciate the honesty about the ingredients. They have options for almost anything (sweet, unsweet, protein, different nut blends...etc), so I can almost ALWAYS find an option that serves the purpose I need. The ingredients are clean as well.  1) Sad, limited, flavorless 
I chose these words because I definitley would be sad without my silk milk! Because of my dietary restrictions, Silk gives me a ton more options to work with. Without it, I would be challenged. I also think Silk has the best flavor, so if I had to use a different type of milk, it would not be as yummy.

The cool thing about this product is that i can mix it with almost everything, I mix it with Nesquik, with Milo, put it in the blender and you get a nice chocolate drink then you decide if you want it hot or cold, another one is to put Silk Vanilla almond milk in a blender with some mixed berries and it's a delicious smoothie, you can try with another fruits too, but it's about to try it :yum::thumbsup::tone3: about the temperature is about how you like it.. hot or cold always is gonna be delicious! 
3. My only ritual is enjoy it all mornings with my breakfast and that's all. 
4. Obviously good and ready to begin my day! :slight_smile:
5. The brand in general is excellent, is a great alternative to replace the standard milk and I recommend it, the package is good, all the product is good in general.  Without My Silk Milk is difficult. I need the almond milk because is the only kind of milk I can take.

1. Well, without Silk Milk literally sucks, because when you get used to something is really frustrating, dissapointing and in part so sad when you don't find it anywhere. 

2. :confused: dissapointing 
     :triumph: frustrating

3. ALWAYS try to find the product that makes you feel good in a healthy way. At the beggining it's not easy, but it's about to see good results for your health :thumbsup::tone3: I feel great because I found a solution for my health and it's very satisfying.",Cupid,
326410,Heather,Knowles,Heatknow@gmail.com,"I chose books because I love reading and all the adventures and experiences that come from that. I chose the stuffed animal because I am a constant nurturer, at home to my kiddo and family, to my friends and (until I became a stay at home mom) I have always been a leader and team builder in my career. I chose rocks to represent my adventurous spirit. I love to travel and be outside as much as possible!  Wake up! Add some to my coffee, I sometimes have an almond milk or other plant milk creamer but I usually end up tossing a lot of it out so I’ve stopped buying it for the most part. 
Breakfast- a bit goes in my smoothie and a good bit in my kiddo’s cereal, we do this about 4 times a week and have a grab and go breakfast the rest of the time 
Every day when we get home from school, I pour my kiddo a cup of milk and add either chocolate or strawberry mix. Today was no exception :) 
I use almond milk in a ton of recipes, tonight I made a creamy tomato sauce and used 2/3 cup in my dinner. 
It’s friday night so I made chocolate chip cookies and ate a few as a family. We all had a cup of almond milk. My husband usually never drinks almond milk (or any milk really) he did have a half a cup tonight I most enjoy it cooked into recipes, usually baked goods but it really does well in savory items too. It works especially well for me in my vegan pancake recipe. Even though it’s unsweetened and original flavor, it still has a taste of sweetness that really lends itself to a fluffy delicious pancake! For my kiddo, we have a ritual that he has a glass every day when we get home from school. He will rarely drink it plain though and we add chocolate or strawberry or both! He will drink it at any Temperature but for me it has to be ice cold cold. I never sip a cup of silk, I usually drink a cup to balance out what I’m eating and drink it all in a few separate large gulps. It lea es me refreshed and is great for cleaning the palate. It’s not super flavor packed so it’s pretty easy to drink. 
I am not a huge fan of Silk’s packaging. They aren’t recyclable where I live and I dropped one less than three feet from the ground the other day and spent the next 20 minutes cleaning up the mess. (The carton split wide open). I like the branding, love the simplicity and the light fun commercials. I feel good about buying it and I trust them because they’ve been around since before it was cool to vegan. I mean, I’m not sure it’s cool now but at least it’s popular! Back in the old days you had to basically know a password and drive 30 miles to a patchouli hell hole to get anything vegan, but silk isn’t like that. It popped up in smaller grocery stores in smaller towns a long time ago so I like them.  1. Sad, boring, expensive 
Sad because I think that Silk brings lightness and joy to an otherwise pretty boring part of my shopping. They’ve brought innovation and selection and just plain choices to everyone. You don’t have to be rich to buy Silk, you don’t have to be anything. It’s the everyman’s almond milk. Accessible, always in stock, always well priced and always a variety, in my neighborhood grocer.

We pretty much always have unsweetened original Almond Breeze.  Many years ago, I used to get the chocolate flavor as well!

3.  Myself, I'm more likely to consume almond breeze when it's mixed into things, although I do sometimes make hot chocolate with it in the winter.  The kids both like glasses of it, though.

a. Probably unsurprisingly, I'm most likely to consume Almond Breeze at meal times, but it does occasionally feature in a special treat, like a vegan milkshake or hot chocolate or cake.

b. Usually in the kitchen eating a meal.  Most often, I'm with the kids.
c.  I'm completely clear on this question, but on average, I find myself pulling the almond milk out of the fridge at least 2-3 times a day, every day of the week.   Sad, concerned...and hungry!

3) Food plays an essential role in creating family bonds: as we eat together, we share ideas, plans, and memories.  If we lost Almond Breeze, we'd also lose one of the essential ingredients in my family's comfort food. Primarily, I'd be sad about missing out on those shared memories tied to food.  There are other dairy-free milks, sure, but Almond Breeze has an amazing taste, and it also has a higher nutritional value than the vast majority of the alternatives. ",Cupid,

It's full of watercolor drawings, habit trackers, collages, and anything else that's interesting. It's important for me to have something else to do while waiting somewhere other than playing with my phone. I usually take about a year to complete a journal, and I love to look back and see where I was at any given time.
2nd item: Headphones. When I work out, I have to have music to motivate me. When I'm going for a long walk, I love to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. Headphones help me learn so much when that time would otherwise be spent staring at the ground.
3rd item: Fitbit. The only time I'm ever competitive is with exercise. I like to best myself and keep track of all my goals. 2) The flavor is either unsweetened original, or unsweetened coconut almond blend.
3) Usually I am having it with breakfast in my cereal, or at work in the break room in coffee. Both of these are usually early in the morning (between 7-9), 5-9 times a week.   1) Bummed, confused, annoyed
I try not to get too bent out of shape when my favorite products go off the market, but I really have made Almond Breeze a part of my routine and I don't want to have to try a bunch of other brands to get a second-place option.

3) So I made a collage and the voiceover would be: ""Wow. This really sucks. Now I have to waste money trying to find a replacement. And it's probably not going to be as good anyway. And I'll have to wait to find a good replacement, so I could go weeks without cereal, which is, basically, my fave."" ",Cupid,
326358,Alexandra ,Svee,Sighsnotsad@gmail.com,"The three ""objects "" I chose are plants, drawing supplies, and dogs. In the descriptions below I will further explain my connection to each. The type of Almond breeze that I drink is original unsweetened. Cow milk is not sweet and doesn't have vanilla added, so I have never understood why it's so common in milk alternatives! I like the basic, versatile flavor of unsweetened original for all purposes!   1. I hate to say it, but imagining a world without almond milk makes me feel personally sad, conflicted, and hopeful. As much as I love almond milk, I know that the industry is not free of its own political and environmental concerns. I have seen documentaries about how the vast expanses of almond crops in California require bees to be shipped in from across the country to polinate, and pesticides used are challenging local bee populations. It's important to me that products I support are conscious of their impact on the environment, especially in these times when it has become a dire matter. I feel sad thinking of how I benefit personally from a product that may do more damage than its worth. I feel hopeful knowing these conversations are being had and people are becoming more conscious of how they consume. I feel conflicted because I want what's best for the world at large, and for my belly.
2. See image
3. In this visualization we can take a look at both the small, personal connections we have to this beverage, as well as the bigger impact that almond milk industry is having on the environment. I can never separate the two in my mind, and we live in a time when I don't think anyone should. It's important to think about everything happening behind the scenes and weigh the pros and cons in each choice we make. If we switched fully to almond milk from dairy, we could eliminate all of the problems associated with the dairy industry, but what new issues would be created? How could we reimagine the way we farm almonds to be more sustainable in the long run? I don't have the answers, but viewing problems creatively is the first step! ",Cupid,

I enjoy Almond Breeze in a variety of ways, though I generally don't have a glass of it. In the morning I'll have it mixed with cereal, and a splash in my coffee. Then, when I make protein shakes for lunch I will use Almond Breeze to add some liquid to the shake so it has a good texture and flavor, without having to use real milk. I generally eat breakfast in my kitchen at home, and then I have lunch in my office at work. I don't have Almond Breeze for every meal, but several in a week.   I would feel concerned, sad, and curious. I would be curious as to why there was no more Almond Breeze, depending on why there was no Almond Breeze would probably affect my reaction.

- For breakfast I mix a few things to get my perfect coffee, lol :
   Coffee Mate Almond Milk Vanilla Creamer - I only use a splash of almond milk creamer because I don't like things too sweet ( I wish they made a mocha     creamer ).

- Sometimes I go to Starbucks and get a small iced coffee ( with no ice, lol - I can't drink things too cold either ) with extra almond milk as a pick me up in       the afternoon 

- I also usually have a glass with dinner. I either have a glass ( or two, lol )of Original Almond Coconut Milk or occasionally, if I am craving chocolate - I will mix about half a glass of Silk Dark Chocolate Almond Milk with half a glass of Almond Breeze Original Almond Coconut milk ( the Silk Dark Chocolate is a little to sweet for me ).

I could go back to regular milk.  I still drink it now and again.  I have just found that I really prefer the taste of almond milk or coconut milk.

I use almond milk for a lot of my cooking during the week since I have found it works the best for most things.

In my visualization, I chose the image of a desert and the words ""barren,"" ""challenge,"" and ""no choice"" for a few reasons.  One, the desert represents a barren area with not much outward variety, much like the offerings of other brands in my area. It also represents what this world may turn into if we do not stop consuming animal products.  This leads to my next word of ""challenge"" because Almond Breeze is so affordable and good quality.  It is one I recommend to friends who want to switch to plant milks.  Not having that option might make it more challenging then for helping people to switch to a plant-based existence.  ""No choice"" is fairly self-explanatory.  I live in an area where we are just now seeing a surge in plant-based options.  Many of the new brands available are still cost-prohibitive so taking away Almond Breeze would leave little to no choice for someone who wants to try plant milks but cannot afford the pricier options.

Now that we are doing baby led weaning and my son is eating, I will drink a glass and have some oatmeal or eggs and toast and share with him.

My husband and I purchased a package from Diamond Resorts which gave us extra points we need to use in a prescribed amount of time. We are using the first batch of points to travel to Branson, Missouri. We will stay there one week and my sister and brother in law who live 3 hours out, but also in Missouri, will drive to join us. We are going to have a 2 bedroom at The Suites at Fall Creek and we are gifting them their rooms for this trip. Branson has many theatres with musicals, magic, extravaganzas, “copycat” acts (Elvis, for example) and well-known singers. None of us has been there before so the combination of a new place, fun things to do, and my sister, made it a match made in heaven. We reserved the room from Diamond Resort about 4 months ago and also booked our airline reservation (one way, as we will be driving back from Branson with my sister to her home.) We will get to see her family and grandkids visiting a few days, then will fly back home to Phoenix from St Louis, Missouri. 
Because we have not been to Branson we have spoken to many of our friends to find out what shows we definitely should see, what places we should visit, where we should eat, etc. My husband is also looking online for places within a 2 hour drive that we may not be aware of but would want to see while we’re there. Because of that and for purpose of driving, we will rent a car just for the time until my brother in law and sister meet us. From that time on, we will use their vehicle.

What I love about it, is that everyone has an opportunity to become known because there really is no “3rd party” involved. If people love your YouTube video, they Like and Share it, and before you know it, people know who you are. 
We are helping out at a garage sale tomorrow and want people to know about it, so we shared this information and, as a result, people brought donations and will be back to purchase from the sale. One of the best features is the ability to SHARE beyond your means as your Friends Share with their friends.
It can be risky, but used wisely, has been a great resource.
 (Below many people are viewing my paintings from my FB page) This is our Timeshare Resort experience with Diamond Resorts. We have a Silver membership level with this company. At Silver we have points each year that enable us to stay at resorts based on availability in many major US cities with some limited access out of country.  Booking becomes available 10 months before your planned stay and it is on a first come, first served basis.  We have learned through trial and error, that if you really want to go somewhere, you’d better plan ahead and be prepared to possibly change your plans. Sometimes we get frustrated with trying to book online and have to resort to a phone call in order to make our reservation.
Diamond buys up many distressed properties and converts them into timeshares so you have to research each resort.  Some resorts have stairs and no elevators, some are older and have less amenities, some are still being renovated, and some are just spectacular. Certain things are standard such the provided toiletries, level of customer service, and WiFi. The one thing most aggravating and upsetting to us has been the often mandated visits which turn into strong-armed presentations to upgrade. There have been times I felt I was confronted with the Mafia. But just recently, Diamond Resorts has been (forced, I think) to change their tactics to be less aggressive and intimidating. Again, on Diamond Resorts. 
Good:  fairly consistent, quality accommodations most often with small to full kitchens providing opportunity to eat in, as desired. Encourages travel providing resorts in quite a few cities and states here in the USA. They now offer discounts on cruises, European stays. You have a person you can contact if you are having a problem and they are prompt to resolve situation.
Bad: Time Share limitations because there are so many people using the system so you can easily be ‘locked out” of a place you hoped to visit. As they are 1st and foremost in the business of selling timeshares, you know competition will only get worse over time. There is a significant annual membership maintenance fee that is staggering! It is as expensive as two weeks in a very nice resort - in exchange for maybe 3-4 weeks in very nice resorts. I never would have done this in my previous life. But my husband had this when we married. 
Ugly: strong-arm tactics very often used to intimidate owners to upgrade. Constant push to encourage you to spend more money. This is especially detrimental to older people and people who don’t really understand the consequences of these purchases. COMPLETE REVAMP of the existing format: Customer service that values the “owners” and their financial commitment to the “club.” If selling is so critical to the Member Club success, then more creative extended target marketing for NEW owners rather than excessive pressure on existing owners to upgrade. More “package” opportunities members might enjoy purchasing to boost sales for Club: ie, restaurant and event packages in local destinations. Also possibly providing unique specialized in-room services for extra fees (private couples massages, catered snacks/meals. ANY option which would be pleasing to the owners rather than threatening
I would like to see the “mortgage/real estate” side of timeshare go away. There is a built in threat there - and that threat has been vocalized to us by “sales managers” at presentations before...”this is property and your descendants will inherit it and they will be required to pay the maintenance fee of their own homes will be foreclosed upon!” Yes, they said that to us. I would feel more free if this side of the ownership did not have that edge to it. I would also very much like to see if be something that actually had value to someone else, so that we could SELL IT, if we could no longer use it. As of now, there is ZERO resale value for these private member clubs.",Crypto,
235011,Marcos,Rodríguez Velo,marcos.rodriguezvelo@gmail.com,"As I said, I wouldn't mind dedicating some ammount of money to invest into cryptocurrencies.
This kind of investment still sounds to me very risky, so I would prefer to put just some money into it and see how it develops. I would do it like a 'buy and hold' type of investment.
If there were earnings, I would start using cryptocurrencies for some transactions. I think ICOs are a good way to obtain money for a new project.
One of the good things is that it allows the creators of the cryptocurrency to get money out of the usual channels like banks or investors, which can be used to get better conditions. Also, for individual investors, it's a way of investing in new and innovative projects in a direct way.
On the other hand, there's always the risk that the new cryptocurrency is worthless, so all the money is lost. Also, the security of the new cryptocurrency can be a source of problems in my opinion.
Lately I've heard about two potentally good ICOs: on is Real (https://www.real.markets/), a real estate crowdfunding, and Pylon (https://pylon-network.org/), about renewable energies. My next trip will be to Spain for Christmas. Normally I would stay at my parents' house, but this time my girlfriend will come with me, and we will also make some small trips while we are there.
So, we will need to book the plane tickets and then some hotels for the days that we want to visit some other place. We used to go to hostels, but our experience is not so good lately, so we prefer to go to more traditional hotels. We like to have breakfast included and ocassionally dinner too. Wi-Fi is a must (because of work reasons), and also private toilet and bathroom. Depending on our destination, bike rentals are also a very good thing to have.
When traveling for work reasons, I normally look for places with breakfast service included and Wi-Fi. The rest of accomodations are no so important as I don't spend too much time in the hotel. A simple explanation of 'sharing economy' is: a service/good/activity with a high cost that can be shared between various individuals to lower the individual cost.
I think my first experience with this (even though the 'sharing economy' concept wasn't a thing yet) was when me and some friends put some money together to buy a videogame that would would otherwise very expensiveto buy by ourselves. Of course this model doesn't work very well with goods, but for services like transport it's an amazing thing.
Also, platforms of open knowledge (let's say Wikipedia as the most important website about this) are an incredible development for everyone. And crowdfunding too, of course. Giving the opportunity to everyone to directly invest and support the products that they like, it's a great idea. I think I've only used once Airbnb. It was in Warsaw when I moved there from Spain, and I used it while I was looking for a flat. It was a good experience.
It was a small studio for just one person with just the necessary things for staying two-three nights. There was even some food in the fridge (available on request and for free) and a good internet connection.
I've heard from some friends that they didn't have such good experience, so that's why most of the time I prefer to book a room in a hotel. The good thing is the privacy, exclusiveness and sense of belonging with people who share the same interests and way of thinking as you have.
But, when you are not in a group/club that you would like to belong to, it seems sometimes that it's just a group of people who want to pretend to be privileged.
I think I don't have enough experience in this kind of clubs to have a very well formed opinion. Nowadays we have the chance to express our opinions and interests about anything. It seems that there can be a private club fr anything that we can imagine!
Of course the private clubs of the future will be based mostly on the web, but also they will need a physical location where every member can interact in real life with other people. They will be places based more on the professional career and interests and connections than in money. An ideal place to do networking, and meet people with your same professional interests.
It will be a place with cultural concerns, there can be exhibitions, events, workshops all over the world.
Of course, no discrimination based on gender, race or anything.
For me, one of the most essential requirements for members would be to have a creative spirit.",Crypto,
240099,Charlotte,Cramer,charlottencramer@gmail.com,"I think Crypto will influence my life not just in relation to investments but life in general. I'll start with its influence more broadly. 
1. Travel - I anticipate that greater access to and spending options of crypto will especially change the way that I spend during travel - avoiding exchange rate issues and bank charges. 
2. Salary - I can imagine that in the future crypto will form a part of my compensation at work - whether that means that part of my salary is in Crypto or is a part of my benefits (a healthcare coin?) 
3. On the downside, in the mid-term I think it's going to get very confusing having so many different 'coins' and not knowing which single 'currency' you tie them to. For example, I may have 5,000 BTC, 140 ETH and 100 LTC but what does that mean? Without tying those values to a currency which I can spend - it's not very clear what I own and feels a bit like I own nothing. 

In relation to investments... 
1. I'll be curious to see (and actively invest in) any Crypto which has positive social impact 
2. I can imagine spending more of my time learning about and tracking Cryptocurrencies - especially when they fall and peak in value rapidly. N/A (sorry, I don't know what that is) I'm flying from SF to London for Eurobest - an Advertising festival/conference - where I'm speaking about women in ad land. I'll be flying alone (I booked this personally, finding the cheapest, direct option) and will be booking an Airbnb. 

I decided to book the cheapest flight as it's also direct from convenient airports. This would only differ for business trips if there was adequate budget for a better airline but I'll always choose having a direct flight over a nicer airline with a layover. 

With regards to the airbnb - I find it's a convenient option for longer trips (I'm staying in London for 10 days) as I can cook myself which I prefer because eating out everyday while traveling makes me feel unwell and I gain weight. Having a kitchen if I'm staying for over 5 days is essential to me. A nice to have would be access to a gym or a gym/running route close by. The things it must NOT have are in a dangerous part of town, far from where I need to be (e.g. a beach for personal, office/conference center for business). In fact, when I book a business hotel it has to be in walking distance from the location I'll be working from. 5 - No ownership, manufacturer/brand ownership, Government ownership with multiple users. Appeals as it means I don't have to own something I use rarely. Save on cost of ownership, cost of maintenance and the stress of owning and maintaining something physical - plus how physical products weigh you down, keeping you artificially tied to a location. For example, if I had a car in San Francisco I would feel less 'free' to move to Sydney. Those physical items become a burden. 

6 - Things that are expensive, used rarely and/or use valuable resources in a shared space. This could be designer clothing, jewelry, cars, camera equipment, sports equipment, I've used Airbnb extensively for business, holidays and weekend getaways. Also as a last minute 'crash pad' next to an airport.
For weekend getaways or longer vacations I will book far in advance balancing a number of options which I share with people I'm traveling with. I'll usually look once, share a selection (5 or so) and then come back to book one some time later. 
When it's a last minute thing I'll do it on my mobile while on the road, usually selecting whichever is top of the list, within my price range (for last minute in the U.S. that's typically ~$100/night. 

Essentials - option of access without interaction for late check in, comfortable, clean, kitchen basics. Also HAIRDRYER! It's so annoying when they don't have one, I really think this should be an essential. 

Nice to have - A welcome sign! Love that :) 

Must Not Have - Noisy roommates, smelly, dirty. I think of it being stuck up, exclusive and uninviting - making me feel unwelcome. 
Soho House isn't like that though. I think it has created a great creative community in beautiful spaces and I love being there. I imagine the members clubs of the future being far more dispersed with access in more remote locations to support nomadic work-life. There is less and less need to live in a city and I think it makes economic sense (for businesses and workers) to be dispersed. With that in mind, I hope that these clubs will provide living essentials in a membership model where people can sleep, work, eat and feel a part of a Global community.",Crypto,
240097,Audra,Mitka,audrao@yahoo.com,"I think cryptocurrency being a safe and secure way to buy products / pay for things, to transfer funds and fund investments. Hopefully it will have a positive effect in the future for secure transactions. I know that  it is an unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is used by startups to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks. My next upcoming trip is for the thanksgiving holiday to south florida.  I will need to book airfare and hotel.  It does not differ from that of business trip to personal trip.  I will be traveling with my husband and we will look for a type of accommodation with a kitchenette so that we do not have to eat out for every single meal.  We like to have a kitchenette for long trips so that we can just go out for dinner.  Other must haves are a pool and to be near the beach and lots of sunshine! The sharing economy is an economic system in which assets or services are shared between private individuals, either free or for a fee, typically by means of the Internet.  Thanks to the sharing economy you can easily rent out your car, your apartment, your bike, even your Wi-Fi network when you don't need it.  It is more appealing over conventional models in that you can have more amenities at your disposal like having an entire home to stay in compare to just a room (like a hotel room).  It can also be more cost effective.  I think examples of when this model works best is by staying in an airbnb, or using zipcar (or similar).  It also works best with shared ride services - Uber or Lyft, divvy bikes (as we have in the city of chicago) are some great examples that come to mind. As far as accommodations in the shared economy models my own experiences are using airbnb.  I really loved my experience because I staying in a home that had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.  For me the must haves are basically good communication with the owner operator, a kitchen, towels, TV service, and internet service.  Nice to have services are a pool, travel size soap, shampoo, sunblock, etc. Hmmmm, well I actually associate a private gentleman's club like in the old days, or a country club that you need to be a member to use.  In any case there is usually a substantial membership fee to join and annual dues in one form or another.  But now there are vacation clubs or timeshares that could qualify as a private members club as well.  There could also be different types of accommodation rental organizations that might be available to members only. For me, I would like a private member club for high end customers.  I would like it to include high end properties that have a lot of amenities so maybe they include usage of their automobile and include different things in the area like reservations at exclusive restaurants, tickets to shows that happen to be going on during my stay.  The club would also have a concierge service to handle all aspects of the booking and to be able to tell me what else is included since it would be different at different times of the year.  I like person to person contact and not having to wait for replies to emails.  It would be nice to have a guarantee / generous cancellation policy and to use a safe and secure payment method without a fee attached to it.  It would also be nice if the concierge would also include making airfare arrangements if necessary.  It would also be nice if there was points or rewards you could earn each time you use the club or their services.",Crypto,
240101,Participant,240101,p_240101@recollective.com,"I'm super interested in cryptocurrency especially when I hear things like this - https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/lily-allen-bitcoin-stable-over-pound-twitter/ I remember hearing the Lily Allen BitCoin payout she turned down. It makes me feel like I don't want to be left out and that there is an opportunity away from a traditional investment that does not feel that relatable to me, it feels very much like old establishment and cryptocurrency is very much the future. It does relate to my investment pillars I just need to take the plunge. But this scares me as I'm horrible with passwords! https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/?mbid=nl_102917_daily_list1_p1 Plus I don't know many people that have so it would be great to hear more stories around it and have it explained in a easier to understand manner. I'm still in the early stages of learning about ICO's but I think it makes sense for startups, retailers or crowdfunding platforms to collect ""donations"" instead of going through all of the regulations for gathering funds - it's such a complex system. I know that the Bank of China has banned them but I think it's a new way of trading and paying for things that will continue to grow in the digital era but it still feels a bit unsafe to me as there is no protection for potential fraud. I'd only trust brands I know. I have an upcoming trip to Tel Aviv for New Years (I've never been!) with my boyfriend. The purpose of the trip is a much-needed break from Berlin's grey winter. I booked the flights back in July when I got a great deal and have yet to book accommodations. The goal is to wander as much as possible and get lost in the cities, no maps and only a very small agenda of what to eat (so important!) and see. Aside from accommodations, I may book a cooking school and some transportation to the dead sea for the day. I tend to not like to book too much in advance as it does not leave very much room for discovery when it's all planned out with every detail. 

In terms of accommodations, I first and foremost prefer something central and clean - basic requirements. I don't drive so the address means more than the home accessories. 

Since I'm a freelancer and I work remotely quite often it does not differ too much. If a client is paying though they tend to want to go with hotels and a set plan over my free-form travel itineraries. I also may be on my own for these trips - more budget (not paying!) but less company. The sharing economy to me is about maximizing the usage out of something for the benefit of many. Cars, flats, lawn mowers, weekend homes - all the things that don't get used all the time are perfect for the sharing economy. It also brings you closer into connecting with a community, city or something you might never have had the opportunity to use/try. I think it does appeal to traditional models if done right and it has to feel like it benefits many - not just one. 

I think it works best for access to things you would not get to try - a shared cow gives you local, ethical meat. I can't nor don't want to the whole cow but man I think it's a better streak! I want to try an amazing handbag but I don't need to own it- I think the sharing economy is perfect for those who value experiences over things but still love the good things in life, they just don't feel the need to own them. I also love the creativity that it enables - see home cooked meals site https://www.josephine.com/ I have used many accommodation sites (airbnb, house swaps, facebook groups etc) but for the most part only for a place to sleep although I know they have shifted their model to include experiences and even restaurant bookings. I like it for the most part but part of me is lately feeling very badly of how it's transformed neighborhoods that feel more like local hotels then the places I wanted to explore for local flavour - so much of that is going away (Barcelona, Iceland). 

I'm all for services that put me in touch with the realness of a city but some services to me are silly additions - I just saw a startup offering beach chair bookings in advance! That is not a service I am interested as it feels too programmed and nothing is left to chance. I have a love-hate relationship with private clubs. I'm not a fan of the ""exclusivity"" that's not what I seek out it a deeper connection to a community and in my experience in living in different cities trying them (New York, Vancouver, Toronto, London, Berlin) I only like them if I feel like I'm getting something out of them - just saying I'm a member of Soho House in Berlin means nothing as once you've swiped your card I tend to find I don't get much from it. I do love and use private members clubs in the form of co-working spaces (see one from India) these to me are great as I'm gaining access to a space and community like me and it's with a purpose. 

So for me it has to be with the end result being a deeper connection to community. I would like a private members club that is the perfect blend of work and play and actually furthers along my career - it's not just for ""being a member of"" that's old-fashioned. I think a membership of the future is global on ships, land and air. It's always moving and not just in one place think Remote Year but not so group travel like. 

The clientele would be creative and open - selected because they were wanting to connect and valued community. You'd be paired with member - almost like a Tinder style so you had a buddy from the start. Membership could be paid by what you can contribute (skills swaps) not just based on fees. The vibe would be chill, easy and conversations could happen anywhere not just within cliques (I find that with Soho House) the house rule is anyone could join conversations and work projects would be sourced and pitched from the community of the house. 

The services would be all about mind (school of life classes), body (pilates) and passions (startup meetups, sewing groups etc.), I'd like the classes to push past boundaries and let people grow in every facet of their lives. And the space would be a celebration of all things local and amazing, vibrant and the kind of place you can't wait to hang!",Crypto,
240107,Participant,240107,p_240107@recollective.com,"honestly at this point iam just figuring this whole thing out but I believe that eventuelly everything will shift to cryptocurreny at one point. Its the future. I dont believe its as ""democratic"" and super controllable as everyone thinks as all those currency a measured in a certrain worth and who determines this worth? when I read that the amount of energy you put into it to create the blockchain decides the value than its still the same principle of ""who has the most"" but yeah maybe I got it all wrong.. Iam very hopefull on this one though, being traceable and all.
A lot of artists are starting to work with cryptocurrency. F.E. bjorks new album will available with cryptocurrency only! thats a very interesting movement..
thinking about my investments I dont see what this would change, as Iam more of an oldschool invester in real estate and equipment as you see. Though, my cousin is working with bitcoin and reading about it I think I should hit him up and see if I can be part of this in someway.. it IS indeed very promising but who knows. sorry I have absolutely no clue about ICO nor have I have used it. My boyfriend and me are making a little roadtrip from LA to Lake Tahoe, to celebrate a friends birthday there over the weekend. They rented a house there for a couple of people. We decided to make a little trip out of it visiting Death Valley, Yosemite, Monolake and just get lost along the way which actually is the most fun. So this is a leisure trip and we were thinking of booking some parts of the trip and leaving other days open for exploring and see where we land. We usually use airbnb for longer stays (cleaning and other fees ususally add up too much for only one night), otherwise would book a hotel.. Iam a bit picky though, I´d always prefer a small (boutique) hotel run with love to a big company one. We use the app ""hotel tonight"" or I would check booking.com or my travel guide book to read recommendations. We definetely need a big bed or two beds and a blanket for each of us. organic supplies and food would be nice but are no must. Sharing economy for me means sharing a ressource you have but dont need for yourself alone or maybe cant even afford alone, to share with others. Iam a big fan of that as I consider myself a (digital) nomad, travelling a lot and having several ""homes"". So for me it doesnt make any sense to own a car back in Berlin or even Bike and just have it standing around most of the time. Thats why i use car sharing and bike sharing and I love it! It makes me feel free of responsibility and monthly charges while still being totally flexible transportionwise. In Berlin I use services like drivenow and citybike but also the app Drivy or in LA its Turo, which leds you rent from private persons, almost like airbnb for cars. Iam also occupying my own flat in Berlin only a couple of months in the year, so Iam renting it out the other times, sharing my beloved apartment and all things in it with strangers. As they do with me, when I rent from airbnb f.e.. 

So regarding question nb 6 I think Iam a good example of how this works. there are so many ventures like this popping up that goes even to sharing your designer hand bag and gown for the evening. 7// So iam renting out my apartment on airbnb and when staying some place longer I usually rent from airbnb as well. I´ve had lots of good exeriences and a couple of not so nice ones but nothing too dramatic. I very carefully choose who I let rent my apartment, as I want someone who is responsible and clean aso. Using airbnb has been really nice so far, of course I chose what i want rent regarding my and the owners taste as well. I like to see how other people decorate their home and it kinda feels like getting to know the person as well. My boyfriend on the other hand is more of a hotel guy or prefers airbnbs who are ment to be rented out as usually dont have all the nippes one collects over a lifetime. he likes cleanliness.

8// its nice if the cleaners come inbetween but I can also do that myself. regarding security if anything happens I was lucky enough to not need it until now but I heard with airbnb especially its a pain in the ass so sometimes I wonder why I even use it when its not providing some safety in case anything goes wrong. at least thats what i pay for with the damn service fee. its also hard to contact them, sometimes their idiotic FAQ forms are hard to understand or not even close to what i need. Iam happy about paying more fees when I know theres a really good costumer service involved. When hearing the name the first thing that comes to mind is something like a rich kids-club with lots of people paying a ludacris amount of money to be very exclusice when sipping champagne. 
It took me a while to understand the term also stands for any kind of members-exclusive thing which of course can be nice when you are a frequent traveller or need a professional environment for meeting with clients f.e.
Sure its about exclusivity which can be nice and is certainly convenient and not always about luxury just hearing the term gives me the taste of something overpriced, maybe because lots of these things are, in my eyes. 
Visually I can help myself but see lots of bling:) thinking about all hte questions and trying to derive essentials from it I think it would be exciting to have certain groups of people that trust each other. I think that would be the most important. Iam sure there are lots of groups like this, iam personally a member if a couple of womens groups (not clubs though)... it could mean providing a safe space for people to share knowledge f.e. and investing in that space together as a group. Or it could be a club of people who share the same interests while travelling, f.e. like us prefering nice and small boutique hotels and that group could hold a room in certain hotels or would get advantage in booking (again I see that private clubs are mostly about advantages and its even hard for me to think of it without it) 
Combining cryptocurrency I was wondering if that could make it a bit less elite and open to other to people with other ressources than money. like knowledge or skills that could be shared inside a club member community. So the clientele would be more diverse, people could potentially become more open, tolerant and learn from each other, while still sharing a mutual interest, like nice and quiet holidays without kids screaming. Or only hanging with kids and families and no business vibe...",Crypto,

198801,Philix,Liu,philixliu@gmail.com,"To my knowledge and my interaction with my friends who have invested in BitCoin, I feel Cryptocurrency achieves high yields with high volatility, which is a little bit against my investment principle. I am looking for medium to low risk, long term investment portfolio at this stage of my life, which is newly married and still progressing in my own career. I would probably consider cryptocurrency if I have more savings and flexibility to play with. At the moment, I don’t feel confident enough to make that leap. I am not familiar with this term tbh. I would assume it carries a similar mechanism as IPO in the stock market which I am quite familiar with. I am not sure if this is something legal or legalized in China yet as I am only aware that BitCoin or alike only exist in the gray market here. My upcoming trip is a two week long trip to the UK, one week in South England and one week on the Isle of Islay. It is a personal trip with my family. We will be booking a mix of AirBnB and traditional BnBs. I think either lets me explore the city/town/culture/country in a more authentic manner than staying in a hotel which feels quite standard and surprise-free. There is also a less fascinating story to tell if I just end up staying at a hotel. I would most definitely stay at a hotel if I am on business trips. 
For my personal/family trips, I want a safe neighborhood, clean apartments/beddings, and convenient access to public transportation. It would be nice to have a cool looking or uniquely designed interior. For business, I must have a worry-free check-in process, a friendly service staff and a comfortable and clean room. 5. Sharing economy is utilizing the idle resources for producing maximum functions and benefits for people at a more affordable cost than purchasing/ownership.  I think convenience and low cost are the two key appealing benefits for me. But I also don’t feel too “secure” with shared goods as there could be innate and invisible damages in these goods, which you may not know 

6. I quite like the work space sharing, like WeWork. On the business side, it really optimizes the vacancies of commercial space while bringing in more diversified rents than simply leasing the whole building to one or a very few number of companies. On the renter side, it helps bring down the barrier for having an office while allowing different small business owners to network and generate new business opportunities. 7. AirBnB is probably the only shared accommodation I only would book for entire home as I value privacy a lot when I am staying elsewhere.

8. ESSENTIALS: Private space, safety, cleanness, convenience to public transportation, and good rating and positive reviews, and few negative reviews 
Nice to have: Local tour instructions and recommendations, good design
Must Not Have: Bad customer/guest service like no or rude communication 9. Exclusive access to cool events, products and people, and also costly as it could be a high barrier to enter these memberships One thing I would crave for is the real exclusive rewards the clubs would offer to the real loyalists and they shouldn’t offer these rewards to others who only pay some money for. They need to refine the exclusiveness of the club by only serving the loyal members who have spent not just money but time with them.",Crypto,

Like the famous one, Bitcoin is only gaining value at a very high rate. I was talking to a friend about it to a friend a month ago, and if I had purchased bitcoin then, I could have won about 1450$ simply by having bought it.
However, it's still virtual value and I'm not sure where that can be exchanged properly apart from online services or products. 
Cryptocurrencies are erasing the middle man and banks that used to stand in the way of making profit via trading. 
The transparency of the process is what makes many people call cryptocurrencies the ""currency of the future"", It's all there, you can verify all steps and assets.
I don't know much about cryptocurrencies yet, so I might have a narrow view on how things work for the moment! Honestly I haven't heard of it before, so might not be in the best position to answer that question.
I haven't had any experience with them, but after a quick search it seems to me that it's a way to get startups up and running by crowdsourcing that money?
If I was starting a business, that would be interesting for me! Travel! My best subject ever. 
No tangible plans yet, but I am eyeing a new trip soon! But let me take you through the journey of how I go about trips and planning them.
So right now I have been thinking of either Morocco, Nepal, or Madagascar for leisure. 
I also have one business trip to be scheduled to Dubai soon. 
I start by booking the time in my calendar and look at tickets. In terms of accommodation, I start by seeing if I know friends in those places or I would ask for recommendations for good places to consider.
During personal trips, and depending on the country, I sometimes divide my stay into two parts, the first part where I'll be more on the go, and go towards very cost-effective accommodation, so I can spend more on the second part of the trip in a lavish and unusual boutique hotel. 
When it's not the case, I turn to Airbnb and look for comfort above all. Comfort meaning i would prefer to rent the entire apartment instead of sharing. The essentials when renting an apartment on airbnb is to be in the center, close to nightlife spots, or very easily accessed to by public transport. 
When I make trips to New York, Paris, London or Dubai, I usually have alot of friends in all these cities, so I never end up looking for accommodation, which is a good thing given rates are rather expensive in those cities! '- Sharing instead of buying! I see the sharing economy as a model where people can share goods with one another, instead of going towards consumption. 
This model appeals so much to me! And I would truly like to do more of it. 
We are living in an age where everything we buy (from clothes, to food, to tools, etc..) can impact our planet in a very negative way. Fast fashion is a second biggest polluter in the world. I've now taken an oath to only buy things that I truly need, and buy much better quality (more expensive but it lasts) so I don't have to throw away something after a season or a year. 
In that same logic, same goes for other goods. Why buy when you can rent?

- I've been thinking a lot about the neighbourhood tools store that are very common in Germany, and I've already thought about opening one in Beirut. It can be on a building level, or a neighbourhood level. People can put all the tools that they have at home, and agree to share them with neighbours. When I use my blender once every month, why shouldn't I think of lending/renting it to other people who need it for a very short time as well? Same goes for a lot of things I own at home, I barely use them! I think that's a good example where I see the sharing economy working well.
Same goes for city bikes as well, and soon enough car rentals. I own a car in the city, but I don't use it as much because I favour ubers or walking, or carpooling. I could easily get rid of my car if we had a car sharing service in Beirut that would allow me to get out of the city when I need to.' '- Ive always had a very positive experience in sharing accommodations, wether I was renting or hosting. I noticed the more you know about the person before, the more comfortable and positive the experience! So I always make it a point to say a lot about me, and ask questions. I wouldn't accept someone renting my apartment if they just booked it without adding a good message with it. Good communication is the key!

- A good key is cleanliness and what the services are to provide that ""feeling of home"". So fresh sheets, towels are a must for me to feel comfortable enough.' I have to admit, I used to have a negative image about private members clubs. I have a shaded view on the idea that money can get you somewhere that other people don't have access to. 
I usually like things I earn with merit, and not with money. 
However, in the way we've been exploring this activity so far, I've been curious about it. And suddenly a private members club that allows me to travel in a different way seems to be alluring! 
I would question, however, how other people are allowed in, and if it's only a paid membership that brings you closer to people, instead of grouping people around ideas and like-mindedness. As mentioned in my previous answer  I would like to see a club where people care about sharing over consumption. People who share the hunger for travel and experiences. People who have an open home (home swapping!) and an open mind.",Crypto,
240087,Ben,Lang,b@langonline.com,"I think there's a big place for it in the future. Right now there's a lot of gold rush type sentiment, which is a bit scary but exciting. A lot of people are making money but a lot of people will lose. I think a lot of people are involved in the space just to make money, I believe that people involved in the space to genuinely innovate are the ones positioned to benefit the most and make the most money in crypto.

I'm excited to see real world applications for crypto when its less viewed as an investment and more as a tool. I think that will come very soon. Once crypto assets are usable in the real world, for every day transactions of all kinds, we'll see how it will transform society. Banks, insurance, ecommerce, all these spaces and more will be drastically changed through decentralized currencies. There are a lot. There are more and more every day. It feels like a lot of people are doing them for the wrong reason. Only to make money. But that's the same with startup investing. Only a few will succeed and most will fail. I believe that's true and applies just the same way to ICO's. 

On the flip side it's a revolutionary way to raise capital and will transform a lot of industries. I think once the bubble calms down a bit, we'll see the more practical applications of ICO's. It's amazing that ICO's make capital accessible to so many people who never had the ability to meet venture capitalists. The democratization this creates is incredibly exciting. My next trip is a fun vacation to Mexico City. I am traveling with a friend, we will share an Airbnb. It's very different from a business trip. I pay for everything in this case, I try to save money and spend all day doing fun activities. For the airbnb, I like the whole place in a good neighborhood. Good ratings for the host are a big deal and of course a fair price.

One of the biggest pains is cash for these kinds of trips. I dont want to deal with currency exchanges which are a pain. More and more I use my credit cards when I travel, which is more practical. I wonder if one day crypto currencies will be used to make the travel payment process more efficient. 

For my accommodation, I'm pretty easy going. I appreciate staying in a good neighborhood with great food and drinks in the area. Sharing economy to me is an ecosystem built around the sharing of resources. We have so many resources available, which are so inefficient, the sharing economy makes that much more efficient for all.

It's revolutionary in that it's a win win for both sides. Providers can make revenue and users get better prices and better access. I think for accommodations it works very well, particularly Airbnb and Couchsurfing. For transportation to, Uber and Lyft have done an incredible job. I think we have yet to see so many spaces leverage the sharing economy concept to increase efficiency. I've used airbnb and couchsurfing. Both have been incredible experiences.

Airbnb - I've stayed at Airbnb in many countries. Every experience was wonderful. From London to Thailand, all over the world. I loved meeting the hosts and seeing their homes from the inside. I also saved money since it's usually cheaper than a hotel.

Unfortunately I havent had a chance to host, I wish I could but in my San francisco building it's not allowed. I'd love to host people at some point.

Couchsurfing  - I used couchsurfing as a host and traveler. I love the incredible community couchsurfing has built. I met some fantastic people. In fact I even fell in love with one of the girls I hosted. She came from Turkey and I hosted her and her friends. We were together for 6 months after. All from that experience!

Essential - rating system, photos, social links. 
I like having the ability to read reviews about the place and people. Also the ability to see photos and social media make me feel more comfortable.
I need to feel safe and comfortable regarding where I'm sleeping. I love private member clubs. If it's free especially, if it costs money, less so. But I think it filters out people, makes it more safe and more of a sense of belonging. I love communities that are closed and private as they tend to be higher quality.

I don't have much experience with private member clubs. I've never joined one. Would love to find an appealing one at some point and join. I think the hardest part is providing true value. the more value the club provides the more engagement and love it will receive and the stronger the community will be. For travel it could be very interesting, particularly for accommodation. For shopping I think there's potential too. At the core, building a strong community around the club is crucial. 

I also believe a huge part of the interaction would be online. Building a powerful technological experience in person and remote are very important. I'd love to see how people in a private member club can connect wherever they are at the moment. One company I'm particularly excited about is Jolt.us. I love the type of learning experience they've built, connecting the real world with the virtual. I believe private member clubs can take the same approach.",Crypto,
235003,Jakob,Aungiers,jakob@jakob-aungiers.com,"I see cryptocurrency (and especially the technology behind it; blockchain) as an exciting new innovation which is still finding its feet in useful application and needs caution to navigate through various bubbles and fads that ultimately emerge from such technologies.

For me personally I would love to see a single, global currency dominate a space. Given political pressures, governance, lack of centralized control etc. it’s unrealistic to think that cryptocurrency will replace currency in the geographical space, however I can see that with enough market action and ease of transactions and liquidity cryptocurrency could well emerge as a dominating the payments of the online world.

As for cryptocurrency as an investible asset, despite the global trend in Bitcoin in the current bull market, the volatility, uncertainty, lack of control, high transaction cost and recent scams in the market, cryptocurrency is not a true investable asset, but rather a gamble investment with no true grounding.

I have a small amount of capital invested in two cryptocurrencies: Lite Coin and Ethereum. Note that I have no Bitcoin investment, this, despite the tremendous growth of Bitcoin, is due to the flaws in its underlying technology. Bitcoin is built on an inherently inferior blockchain platform which is starting to show these days: sky high transaction costs mean that making a transaction with Bitcoin is unfeasible for anything other than large transactions. Slow confirmation times mean that anything relying on instant payment confirmation will not be feasible with Bitcoin. And finally the Bitcoin blockchain is restricted to ONLY Bitcoin payment applications, this makes it inferior to the likes of Ethereum and others which, whist on the surface providing Ether transactions, can also be adapted for any purpose from smart contracts to anything else. With the fact that Bitcoin price is still climbing higher than Ethereum price, this to me is principally indicative of classic bubble fad behavior as people hop onto the Bitcoin bandwagon without knowing anything about the underlying technology, pros, cons etc. ICOs are a way to raise private equity capital without listing ones company on a public tradable market. Whilst on the surface this seems like a great idea for small companies to raise capital, in reality this is open to abuse.

I am not saying all ICOs are abusing the technology, and whilst most ICOs are genuine, having an investor able to buy tokens generated by a company which are linked to the underlying value of that company puts a lot of trust in investors doing very careful due-diligence, which most retail investors will not be doing. Coupled with the fact that ICO tokens issued by a company are not tradable on a primary market (secondary markets may appear, but again may be illiquid for such asset types) and hence also do not hold the same rights as legal shares in a company puts extra risk to investors who would not be able to use legal grounds to recoup losses if the company goes into liquidation.

ICOs are then, in my mind a dangerous asset type right now to invest in. However, with the correct legal and market place rules in place the risks of ICOs could be minimised in the future. Currently I am on one big trip with my life. Right now I am based in Bali and have a one-way ticket to Australia in 25 day. For my trip to Australia (Gold Coast) the purpose is to travel whilst managing my investment, building up my company and working out where to settle.

Booking wise I have my whole life with my in 2 suitcases, a backpack and a surfboard bag so I am limited in the accommodation types I can stay in. I cannot use the classic backpacker hostel route as my luggage is too much, too expensive and I also require some peace and quiet to work and have down-time. So right now I have booked some AirBnB’s for the first few weeks before looking to buy a van and life out of that whilst I make my way down to Sydney.

The essentials in any accommodation for me personally are: Good WiFi, Running hot water for a good shower, and a comfortable bed in a quiet environment. Ideally I also would like to have a desk and good office-type chair to allow me to work extended periods on my laptop in as much comfort as possible. The “sharing economy” model allows users to use physical goods and assets without the need to wholly own the assets (which may be infeasible due to cost, situation and lifestyle).

To me it appeals as it allows me to have access to things that in the past I would have had to pay to purchase outright, even if I need only temporary access to them. I don’t see the sharing economy becoming all-encompassing as there still major pros to purchasing things yourself to wholly own, but as temporary solutions (especially for travelers) the sharing economy is opening new opportunities.

This model works at its best I feel when the need for temporary access to something exists. This could be the need for temporary access to a car (car sharing clubs), temporary access to office workspaces (PAYG co-working communities), and temporary access to accommodation (AirBnB). If there exists a service which people might find of benefit both temporarily and permanently (e.g. owning a car, being part of a club with benefits, owning a plane etc.) then that service could benefit from a sharing economy type model. The only ones I have really used in the accommodation space are AirBnB for sleeping accommodation, and individual co-working spaces for working accommodation.
The AirBnB booking process has clearly been refined to be as smooth and simple as possible, and an important fact for me is being able to see realistic and detailed photos of the accommodation prior to booking, having detailed info on what is and is NOT included in the accommodation and the general rules of the accommodation.

With the AirBnBs I have used in the past I have usually researched the area I want to stay in and then try and find a balance between cost-effective and comfortable accommodation in that area. As with the prior question, the necessities for me have been a good WiFi connection, a comfortable bed in a quiet environment and ideally a good workspace table and chair. Having nice interior décor also relaxes my mood and puts me at ease, allowing me to work and relax properly. Private members clubs are a mixed bag for me. On one hand I see them as a fantastic opportunity to network, relax, meet new people in and have the private use of non-public facilities. However, I also see how many private members clubs these days conjure up feelings of elitism by non-members. Whilst I myself am happy to be included in private members clubs, disclosing your membership to non-members can create an uncomfortable atmosphere in which the non-members think you are trying to make yourself out to be better than them. That would be the bad side of private members clubs, as well as the price some charge for membership and the fact that as a new member it is extremely hard or near impossible to break into the existing cliques that exist in the club. Just because one has become a member of the club, doesn’t mean one is in with the social crowd in the club.

The associating images depict the classic crowds at distinct private members clubs, whilst both crowds are very different, both hold an air of a hard to break social clique. The third image depicts the typical association with a private members club. I like my clubs having a décor of quiet class, with spaces to relax as well as spaces to be productive and socialise in.

Whilst it shouldn’t be a co-working space, it should have a space to allow for quiet work in discreet comfort. This would have comfortable office style chairs as well as all the modern amenities of plugs, USB outlets etc.

There should also be facilities to unwind, from the classic of a social bar, to a pool and gym area (a bonus would be more exciting activates such as bouldering walls). The social areas should be open enough to promote co-mingling as well as having quiet sections for private conversations.

The crowd I see at these establishments are a mix of young-middle aged, creative and inspiring people. I see private members clubs as having some aspect of exclusivity, so naturally the crowd would echo that. However, at the same time I don’t see the point of the Soho House style anti-conservative snobbery of not allowing suits. I feel this club should be more encompassing in allowing any background of intellectual and interesting people in.",Crypto,
225817,Susan,Moon,smoon1211@gmail.com,"I see cryptocurrency fitting into the world as a currency that our current western world (US) is not all ready for, but it seems to be a natural evolution of the direction things are going in. Due to our connectedness, currency is also adapting / mimicking that boundary-lessness. Having lived and worked in China previously, they have done an incredible job of democratizing payment through WeChat (you can pay even if you dont have your wallet or cash- you just need your phone to pay for ANYTHING / EVERYTHING, i.e. at coffee shop, paying for Taobao, paying a friend, etc). I see cryptocurrency democratizing payment in it's own way. Living in NYC, there are still so many places that are cash only, and it feels far behind China in terms of democratizing payment, still very manual. With all the concerns around security/identity theft/etc, cryptocurrency seems to be addressing that issue in a very direct way and eliminating that cause of concern.

The cause of concern that does still remain open is - what does the future of crypto contain? What are the tax laws around it? Though I don't know too much, I've also read about how the leadership of crypto (i.e. should there be a leader at the helm when it is meant to be democratized) is also being hashed out. How will it be regulated in the future? I feel that the different US agencies around crypto will be very slow to adapt to crypto, or to embracing the reality of it. I see that startup / Silicon Valley will be advancing it / early-adopting it far before anyone has any idea of how regulations work, which will eventually force guidelines around it. I.e. in the case of Uber or Lyft. However, Uber and Lyft did this amazing thing where they made you forget you were even paying money because the transaction is so slick - never do you pull out your wallet, and never do you have to go through typing in your card info after the first time. With crypto, since it is a currency, I wonder if people will be more hesitant / slow to adapt, because it is still a buzzy black box to many, and financial literacy in the country is quite low among the masses. But for people that are primed, having tools like Coinbase (what I use) make it more accessible (versus more dark web channels to accessing crypto). 

Investment principles wise, I'd like to see crypto 'branding' itself for itself, giving clear purpose (i.e. who is crypto for? What is it good for? Why crypto? etc). But I tend to be on the late bloomer side, (not being one of the early adopters), so I may not be the prime audience. It's a good question. I'm not all hip to ICOs, however - my initial understanding is that it is such a 'meta' concept to ICO something whose value is already democratized. However, what I do see potential in is the differentiation of the different cryptocurrencies - whether it's based on transaction speed (i.e. Ethereum), scarcity limitations (Bitcoin), novelty and name (i.e. Doge), open-source development (i.e. Viacoin) – I think there is much room and potential to explore what differentiations are to be had. If bigger companies got behind them and put their weight in then I believe it would get a whole lot more interesting. I have an upcoming Cuba trip (mini vacation) - the purpose is to get away and have a trip that is purely to unplug and recharge, rather than meeting any obligations. I find myself often doing ""obligation travel"", i.e. weddings, holidays, families. But this trip is a trip to be a bit removed and not pulled by different external forces.

So far, have booked flight and Airbnb. I believe we (my fiancé and I) will need to book an itinerary (travel to Cuba is restricted for specific purposes). The Airbnb has wifi, free breakfast, good reviews, good location (in historic district). The essential is that the place itself has good reviews (since we've never traveled to Cuba before), and is clean and safe. Nice to have is wifi and free breakfast. 

This differs from biz trips because during biz trips, I usually just need a good location and most variables in my control, so hotels are great for that. No need to worry whether the place is sketchy, or if the hosts are strange, etc. Also, usually the location is central too, since our clients are central. 

I approach personal trips within the US a little differently than this Cuba trip. I'm willing to be more open for this Cuba trip since I've never been before, but for domestic trips, I tend to look for a bit more of an experience - i.e. a lodge, a tiny home, a camper. Something a bit more adventurous. But for the Cuba trip, since going to Cuba is already 'adventurous', I'd like the lodging to be more of a comfortable home base. The sharing economy taps into unused or underutilized resources and makes them available on demand - be it cars, homes, bikes, etc. It is a flexible network of many connected dots, and is widely trust-based and self-regulating. It appeals to me over conventional models because it feels more cozy, homey, ""authentic"", less sterile, sometimes more safe - all at its best. Worst case, it can be janky, unsafe, surprising (not in the good way). 

The model works best when there's an element of experience and quality and delight. I.e. I've been noticing that lyft / ubers lately are becoming like taxis - not a great experience. But Airbnb still occupies that experiential want and satisfaction. I.e. we are ok with a Uber being like a taxi, because at the end of the day we just need to get from point a to b. But with Airbnb, since you're staying and sleeping there, there stakes are higher, and you depend on it more to be a nice experience. other examples i can think of are Turo (car sharing - nice for when rental cars are expensive and have lots of hidden fees, but not great for when you have to drive long distances) , the dog-sitting one where it's essentially you're sharing dogs (which is nice - you can house sit and dog sit and earn money at the same time. Cool to think about how two different elements can be combined like that in the sharing economy sense) I have used Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, Breather, and Grover. The best brooking process tends to help ""forget"" that you are even paying for anything - through ""lightning"" sign instant bookings (i.e. Airbnb). With Breather, I've experienced extremely high touch customer service, where a Breather rep would meet me at my space booking, and ensure everything I needed was there - and if not, help set up a work around solution to ensure the rooms we booked were the perfect fit. 

With Airbnb & Grover, it always makes a huge difference when the home you are booking feels safe, warm, and cozy. These are ""must haves"" for me, otherwise I feel that I might as well book a hostel or hotel. The warmth and friendliness of the owner makes a big difference to make me feel at home away from home. 

For Uber and Lyft, the ease and speed of service is the must have - when the timing shows that an Uber is 10 minutes away, I feel that I might as well ride the subway instead. Also, the sharing (lyft line) component of these services make the experience feel much more commoditized (i.e. I am practically riding a car-bus) than relaxing. 

In general, ensuring that sharing economy services (esp. in lodging) are not commoditized feeling is key, otherwise it loses its differentiation. You might as well book a sterile hotel, or bare minimum hostel if the Airbnb feels like a ""mill"" that churns out guests. The customization element is a nice to have (i.e. hand written note that welcomes), and little details go a very long way (i.e. leaving out breakfast items, making it fool-proof easy to have a great experience by providing restaurant recos / recommended hike trails, etc). The key is to feel like the host is attentive, without having to interact with the host too much, to be honest. The good is the white glove treatment feeling you get in private members clubs. Thinking of airline alliances and perks, I love the feeling of getting priority in line, and having access to the lounges to rest and be undisturbed. The feeling of ""you don't have to worry about it"" because it's already taken care of is the main draw for myself. Also, having access to the private member network across the world - meaning, no matter where I go, I can find the home base and be taken care of - is of course what brings immense weight and value to the private member club. Similar to how you might go to Starbucks when you want a basic, good coffee and gain a sense of comfort in an unfamiliar place, the private members club i.e. airline alliance memberships can feel like a refuge to retreat to from an unfamiliar place. Also, pairing delightful services that enhance the wellness and wellbeing of users (i.e. yoga classes, special experiences) is hugely memorable. 

Some examples I've encountered include - Sephora's beauty insider program - birthday benefits and exclusive perks such as free makeovers; Starbucks and their vouchers, upgrades of drinks, access to limited editions. Airlines that give a warm welcome and landing note on the flight, and slippers. Aman resorts of course is an incredible example of a 'private members' club feel, where there is no detail too hard or small that the staff will not go out of their way to make it happen. 

Though I've had a handful of experiences with these types of Insider clubs, I can't think of too much that is bad or ugly. The degree of ""great experience"" mostly just relies on how far the provider is willing to go to make the experience feel one-of-a-kind. So that means, if the private club has not researched enough their guests, then it loses the high-touch, 1:1 feel. I think the trickiest balance is how to leverage the value of all the members. These private clubs of course want to maintain the exclusive, 1:1 feel. But I also imagine there is opportunity to leverage the network of members without killing the exclusive feel (similar to how sharing economy taps into untapped networks). I think private clubs could likely tap into more ways to make their guests/members feel like ""Influencers"" by featuring their photos on instagram, and other ways to boost reputation. Also, for private clubs to do all the behind the scenes work to make ""authentic experiences"" feel accessible (see photo below). The future of private members clubs help their clients make smart decisions that support sustainability – this is the main element that I see can be missing. They also help their clients create a space of reflection through giving them the space and tools they need to reflect and be able to go back into their everyday with newfound clarity. They involve and engage clients to the extent that the clients wish, always giving the option to understand what is happening locally. 

I imagine the next level to be for private clubs to deeply understand the goals / dreams of their clientele, and then have broad archetype experiences for helping clients reach their goals. I.e. if my goal is to be able to write in peace, then having lodging that creates a writing retreat, and placing appropriate inspiration / stimuli / experiences around to help achieve that goal. Rather than assuming that all clientele have the same broad brushstroke thing that they want to get out of the private members club, creative different tracks of experiences within the same private members club would feel like the ultimate discovery of self for the clientele. The vibe would be zen but not minimalist, aspirational but not propaganda-y, exclusive but not isolated, cozy and safe but not your run of the mill hotel comfortable.",Crypto,
240095,Hayley,McCool,hayleymccool@gmail.com,"I think blockchain will change the world sooner that cryptocurrency will. The city that I live in uses a crypto currency called Colu) (I think it's run by an Israeli firm) and whilst I have read it has good penetration, its user base is basically people like me. People who work in tech/digital. My family (and even my partner until I introduced him to it) wouldn't necessarily start using it until they had a personal recommendation of a friend or family member. I've invested in Ethereum not because of it's cryptocurrency credentials but because of the tech underlying it and I did lot of research about how the financial industries may be using this tech in the near future. I believe it will take years for Cryptocurrency to go mainstream (decades +++) whereas the blockchain could be implemented in so many industries today and change the world. Imagine buying a house on the blockchain - it would take seconds and avoid the archaic need for solicitors, estate agents, surveyors and remove the lengthy time period it takes to exchange. I've attached a video from the open university about how estate agents could use it (the graphics aren't that great but you get the picture). I actually consulted briefly for a company who were looking to do an ICO last year. Having read more and more about them in recent months I would sum them up in one word: Hype.

ICO's IMO are just a way of startups raising money. No different from pitching to a room full of angels or VC's - it just takes less time. I'm still not convinced by them, I think they are a new founded legacy spawn out of over confident, Silicon Valley founders who have a great idea, sure, but have no experience of running a successful (and profitable company). 

That said I'm not so imperious that I wouldn't invest in an ICO per se, if the product was amazing and something I really believed in then I might. I am still reading alot about them and do take an interest but for me the lack of regulation is worrying. Two trips I am going on soon:

Madrid for three nights on a 20 person Hen weekend that I am organising and New York for a week with my boyfriend.

Madrid holiday is a group of 20 girls. We are staying in accommodation found of booking.com as Airbnb is a nightmare for group trips and doesn't  let you 'split the fare' like Uber does. Thats my biggest gripe with it for large groups. I am going on three hen do's next year and non of them are airbnb properties because nobody wants to put it on their credit card and wait for the other members of the group to pay up (which if you have ever been on a hen do, can take months). We  needed to book flights (budget) and accommodation plus the usual activities that you do on these weekends. I am trying to find a treasure hunt to do. We are also booking a rooftop bar somewhere and a restaurant for the night we arrive. It's really difficult organising hens do's IMO as you want them to be unique and offer a taster of the city but when you start researching group activities they are usually bar crawls and generic tours of the city.

New York is an airbnb trip for me and my boyfriend. We will be staying on the Lower East Side as that's the neighbourhood I always stay in - it will be a combination of holiday and I'll set up some meetings there too and poss work out of a co working space for a day or too. My main thing would be wi fi.Other than that we won't really book anything, maybe dinner somewhere but I've spent lots of time in NYC and know it pretty well. That said, I would love to find out about more places to visit that were more local. I really love the sharing economy and think it adds value for both the person sharing and the person buying.To me it is somebody with a commodity/skill/cultural insight sharing it with somebody actively looking for one of those things. For me travel is where this model has really enhanced the traditional experience.  When I had my property on airnb I loved meeting people from all over the world and showing them my city. Ditto I feel my holidays have been enhanced when I have stayed in airbnb properties around the world (if I had a good host).

Outside of airbnb -I like some of the food takeaway services that popped up a few years ago (sadly they seem to have disappeared now). People cooking their own type of varied cuisine from home and then selling it to their neighbours. I like that idea of getting to know your area and neighbours via food. 7. As previously mentioned I have only ever found airbnb to be trip enhancing rather than anything else. I find it far better than staying in a hotel but I must say for work, I will usually just stay in a hotel as i still find airbnb a bit of a nightmare in terms of sorting out/liaising with the host and then gaining access. For work, you want something super convenient and you don't necessarily want to pay 60 Euro cleaning charges for just a few nights. When I'm travelling alone I would almost always stay in a hotel versus airbnb.


8. Essentials:
WiFI
Toilet paper (no joke I stayed in an Airbnb in Lisbon that didn't have this)
Cleanliness
Ease of finding and locating the property as well as easy to get in to (these coded locks are great but they are often problematic) 

Nice to haves:
Tips on the local area/hidden gems
A bottle of wine
list of takeways
netflix
Cooking oils and kitchen equipment (nobody wants to but basic cooking stuff when you are only going to be there a few days) Good:
They offer somewhere private to have meetings and generally the service is very good (albeit overpriced). For business meetings they also provide your brand/company with a certain 'look/feel' which can help impress potential clients. 


Bad: 
Often ludicrously expensive and not worth the money. Inflated food and drinks prices in return for decent wifi. I also think that it costs to much to rent private meeting rooms out in alot of them. The idea of paying yearly or een monthly, I also find archaic. It would be great if you could use them daily or hourly. There isn't much in the way of networking done at these clubs (in my experience) so a closed facebook group (something actually accessible rather than a members website portal) would be great).

Ugly:
Pretentious more of a social statement than anything else which can be dropped in to conversation to boost somebody's ego. I think Private Members clubs could be far more inclusive by offering more services and amenities for a lower cost. These clubs now have to compete with co working spaces which offer a plethora of events and are usually located close enough to cafe's/restaurants for it not to be a chore to get food. They all have tea/coffee facilities plus vending machines. For me, a private club would have to offer more than a decent co working space does. Somewhere where I can host launch parties (but not make it cost prohibitive to startup founders) and provide me with something that co working spaces can't. That could be ridiculous member benefits (and they would have to be ridiculous) as well as access to events and people that were curious/imaginative and memorable.

240093,Juan Carlos,Borrás,jcborras@gmail.com,"That question requires a long answer.

In practical terms one could see a cryptocurrency as a regular ledger. That is a bare minimum understanding of the technology. Think of it as a Time Banking scheme where the time is actually something that the people using it accept as a currency for paying for goods.

Now cryptocurrencies like BitCoin or Ethereum provide the so called blockchain with is a public ledger that can't be tampered with and also provide so called Smart Contracts... which are like well, public contracts with primitives embedded that allow by design enforcing the contract conditions (for instance scrows or programmed transfers).

Therefore the concept of cryptocurrency is not particularly enticing for me but the concept of a public ledger with public smart contracts opens a world of possibilities not for investment but for accounting purposes. When a cryptocurrency is created the stage at which their users get the first currency issued by the process of mining the cryptocurrency.
In my opinion ICOs are nowadays not worth considering for investment opportunities since there is no guarantee that the cryptocurrency will get enough user base to be deemed useful under any circumstances.
I have no experience with ICOs. I do have read that those who participated in some of the nowadays most popular cryptocurrencies have made a good amount of money out of it.
But that is pretty much the same that you get when you take part in a regular corporate IPO when the company gets listed in the stock market.
In the scope of this project I could understand potential interest in an ICO if the domain of application is something I would like to get into. Let's say I would consider an ICO of a given cryptocurrency if I could buy assets I am interested in or if I could use it in my professional domain. For business? Typically up to 3 days working at the customer premises or taking part in workshops arranged by my customers.
I book a hotel close to where the meetings or workshop will happen. Nothing particularly fancy since I only will visit the place to sleep but it's typically a hotel popular amount business travellers. Absence of a gym is a no-no but that facility is very common these days. I'm no loyal to any chain though. As a matter of fact I like to vary the selection to compare services.

When it is a personal trip the requirements are very different: I typically travel with my family so amenities are important but then the destinations are totally different (sun holidays preferred when travelling with my family). If I do an adventure trip on my own I typically go for family owned accommodations. Sharing economy: take an asset that you own but not use regularly and rent it to someone that needs it. Therefore AirBnb belongs to the sharing economy realm but Uber and home food deliveries are not (Sharing Economy vs. Gig Economy).

Think again in Time Banking: you have some time to spare you can use it helping someone else moving, learning how to play the piano, sharing a meal with him... Enormously popular in some societies where agricultural labor is key and subjected to peaks of demand (think on apricot collection for instance where you neighbors will help you with the task but you subject yourself to help them with some other task like vinyard pruning).

Have you got a drill machine? Do you need one to hang some paintings at home? You neighbor may show up and help you with the task. He can even drop the drill machine on the floor so that you do it yourself. You'll enter debt though since you will owe him one for just lending you the tool. But there is not rule enforcing settling that debt. I haven't used shared spaces for accommodation. I have drilled through AirBnb site and I know there are all sorts of services offered there: from the legendary air mattress to full blown luxury properties by the sea.

Talking about the essentials is highly relative. I am considering shared space accommodation for a certain sport event I am taking part 6 months from now in another country. What would my essentials be? A bed, a toilet and a shower. What could I afford? A full property. What will I have to settle with most likely? An air mattress and a shared toilet because the city runs out of accommodations due to the event.

Therefore I'd be hard pressed to talk about essentials because reality is what it is and I may need to carry a tent with me. A bunch of very good friends from high school scattered living all over the world is a fantastic and very exclusive  private membership association. No formalities in it but it operates like a private club.

Elitistic invite-only reserved spaces for the very affluent are on the other side of the spectrum. Notice I am not qualifying them neither as good or as bad.

There are tiers in frequent flyer programs that are higher than the ones advertised. I know a particular one that comprises the 300 people that travel the most on a given airline. Those people get re-routed before you are told that your flight (on which they were travelling too) is cancelled or delayed. Epic membership.

Then I have been in contact with Golf leagues, Free Masons, Rotarians, Lions Clubs... and while not being part in them I've got often to enjoy their memberships perks and activities.

I don't actually judge private clubs, I do tend to believe that by construction they are meant to provide some membership to their members. Heavily decentralized. Loosely connected. Easy to join, easy to detach. No barriers to interactions. A hard core of board members.",Crypto,
373141,Alan,Lamont,alan.lamont@outlook.com,"Patagonia - they have been prioritizing sustainability since long before it was fashionable, and they really put their words into action. When you buy a patagonia product it often has a tag explaining how that particular item was crafted in a sustainable way.  They also were one of the first companies to boycott advertising on Facebook, which was a really brave decision. In my drawing, the foundation of the pyramid is overall security, and the lower an item is on the pyramid, the more important it is (for example, I can’t have stable housing without money, can’t have a career without health, etc.). I also added current events at the top as the pandemic has shown me how global events can have a real impact on your individual sense of well-being. I suspect I would not have listed health with such importance, or even at all. I had a false cancer scare a couple of years ago and it really showed me that our health is the only thing that is truly our own, and life would be fundamentally different without it. I also don’t think I would have listed current events if it weren’t for Covid-19. I have the sense that I should exercise more and eat better, so there is always a sense that I’m not healthy enough. All the processed foods, sugars, etc. must be wreaking havoc on my body.  I also want to feel truly financially secure by paying off all debt, though that is something that has been hard to do over the years. Due to recent events, I would say my career.  Covid has significantly affected my job and has caused my employer to do layoffs. Although I am grateful to still have my job, it is a lot less interesting and fulfilling as I used to travel 3-4 days per week and now I am stuck on Zoom calls all day. That’s hard to say since I’ve never managed to achieve the goal. If I could make it through my checklist of items that I need to take care of in order to feel secure (lose 20 lbs, pay off debt, etc.) then I’d be able to tell you whether it is a state of mind or an end goal. Right now I suspect it is the latter. After graduating college I decided I wanted to travel so I moved to the Middle East to become an English teacher. Only after I arrived did I learn that once I was in the country I could not leave without my employers permission. Although I wasn’t in any rush to leave in the beginning, it was very unsettling to feel trapped in a foreign country. I started my job and went through one week of very basic teacher training, and was thrown into the classroom alone, without any other teacher supporting me. I know now that I was totally out of my depth and felt completely useless and alone in the job. To make matters worse my direct supervisor was unsupportive and must have picked up that I was struggling as she started to make things a bit unbearable for me. I was very young, completely inexperienced and very homesick, and I gradually became depressed. I eventually decided I needed to leave, but I had heard that under the country’s law I may be penalized if I broke the my one-year contract early. In the end I fabricated a story that I was going to Dubai for the weekend so that I could obtain an exit visa from my employer, and I flew to Dubai where I caught another flight home. I still look back on that period and feel a bit ashamed that I wasn’t able to stick it out, but i also think it wasn’t a good place for me to be. Now that I’m older and have encountered quite a bit of professional stress, I may be able to push through for the entire year. But as a 21 year-old I was completely unprepared. I suppose the entire idea of a community is shared security, and we witness this in daily life in towns and cities, business communities, support systems and even online communities. People are meant to be around others, and it can be very harmful for someone to be isolated. 

I certainly feel that my spouse and children’s security is dependent on me, but I haven’t ever really thought about who I depend on for a sense of security. I definitely rely on my wife to help me through challenging times (professionally, emotionally, etc.) but I don’t have a large group of friends and my extended family is all far away, so my support system is pretty much confined to my home. It means having the ability to cover all expenses comfortably while also being able to save and have some cash left over to have some fun with.  But most importantly it means having enough stashed away that I’m not trapped in a job I hate if I don’t want to do it anymore. Finally paying off credit cards and closing them all. I do pretty well about paying down debts, but something else always comes up so that I’ve never managed to close my credit cards entirely. If I really focused I’d probably have managed, but it’s so easy to use credit. Modern, forward-thinking.

The website gives the impression of a company that is looking to the future and is inviting me to let them be part of my future.  I like the use of colors and graphics throughout.  I'm not a fan of the landing page with the option at the top to select the website for individuals, employers, institutions, etc.  Either ask me up-front or just take me to the one for individuals and let folks in the other categories find their way to their part of the website.  I'm not sure who the main landing page is for otherwise.

I like the ""Calculators, Resources, Knowledge"" section, and was immediately drawn to that part of the website.

225809,Pavithra,Sivamani,psivamani@gmail.com,"I am going to talk about a small local cafe here in Edison, NJ called Frappe Joe. They opened very recently, towards the end of 2019. Within a few months of successful business, Covid 19 made an unwelcome appearance in all our lives. This new cafe shut down its business (even when others were offering takeout) to prepare and deliver free food in two shifts to Hackensack hospital (one of the Covid hubs). This gesture earned my respect for two reasons. One, they started doing it even before some big brands started CSR work in the area. Second, it is easier for a big brand to set aside and spend monies on such CSR. Not so easy for a small, new brand like Frappe Joe whose actions have earned the love and respect of the local community. Security is like a big protective umbrella that shields us from bad things. And the different spokes of the umbrella are the different aspects of security. Now each aspect has to be in order for the umbrella to hold and protect us. Any one aspect crumbling means one spoke breaking and the entire umbrella is damaged = as is our sense of security

Financial security is a common thread that suns through all the aspects, except for the emotional security. 

At this point of time, to me, the most important elements are the financial security and the health security. 1) A decade back, I would have given a lot of stress on physical security (owning a home, car) and esteem security ( competing with peers and friends on who is doing better in life, owning luxury goods, etc). I would not even have though of health and providing for a future or contingency planning
2) I feel my mindset has become more holistic and inclusive. Things that were taken for granted like family, relationships, health, financial savings have accrued more importance - maybe due to it being threatened at some point. You know the true value or importance of something only when you know there's a chance of losing it
3) There were three important shifts that happened. One, I had a health scare that made me realize the importance of staying well and of having some savings in case of a medical emergency. Health care in the US is expensive. Two, we shifted from a dual income to a single income household when we moved to the US. We understood why we need to shop smart and save intelligently. Third, we had a baby. Nothing can really prepare you for the entry of a baby in your life and while it brings immense joy, the anxiety that accompanies it is real. Providing for his future, his education, his health is nerve wracking
4) I'd say I have become more mature as to what I want in life. There is a lot of stress on financial planning and saving for the future compared to the reckless spender that I was 10 years back. The focus has shifted from 'what I want' to 'what my family needs' I would have felt more secure if I was also employed and adding to the family income. For various reasons, I am unable to start working at least for the next year. This is compounded by the fact that we are very risk averse and hence do not have any high yield investments. Just a few bank accounts and an insurance policy. Making money from money is an art that we clearly are not willing to learn. 

Investments are subject to market risks and that line itself is enough to put us off. We have no intention of playing roulette with hard earned money just to see it all fly away. There is always the chance of making a windfall but the risk associated with yield generating investments stops us. This obviously hinders many of our financial planning activities. Undoubtedly, the financial security is the most insecure element. Job and income loss, inability to pay bills, saving enough to buy a house, etc are all key concern areas. 

There is no point buying a plant and keeping it alive without growing. We need to nurture it and ensure that it flowers. Similarly, in our case, somewhere we need to get over our fear of risk and invest other than our bank accounts. For this to happen, we need to find a high yield, low risk plan that can give us guaranteed results. I totally agree with this. For one, this feeling of security is something till we need till our last breath. It is not something that can be accomplished in 5 or 7 years. Secondly, feeling secure is not just about money, it is a sum total of many fears, wants and hopes. It is a highly emotional feeling that cannot be quantified on paper. Lastly, the dimensions of feeling secure will keep evolving and changing through our lifetime. Ten years back, showing off to my peers was important. Today, it is saving and health. Ten years down the line, it will be something else. In that sense, it is not an end goal but a continuously evolving goal I moved to the USA from India in early 2014. I received my EAD a couple of months down the line but its difficult to find a non IT job here for a person of color. Back in India, I was heading my own team and was being groomed for senior management in the organization. I didn't begin to worry till the end of 2014 and by then, nothing had still clicked. I felt helpless and a bit embarrassed that I had to live off my husband's money (not that he ever questions me on how I spend). It was like God was playing snakes and ladders with me and he just pushed me off that large snake that brings you down from 97 to 3. Having come from a family, where women have occupied important positions in their careers, I felt like a failure and a liability to my family. At some level, I started to feel really insecure of my talents and my experience

a) This might sound silly, but I decided to have a baby. Although I wasn't working, my husband still was and my clock was also ticking away. I figured if I wasn't getting a job, I might as well be a mom
b) I don't regret my decision at all but in hindsight, it may have been good to work and have a baby. Should have kept trying for a job, even if it was work from home. It would have boosted my morale and the financial contribution would have been welcome
c) Nothing has happened since! I guess I didn't realize how demanding being a mother is and this year, my son finally started daycare and I was going to start my hunt again but Covid came into our lives... 1) Not really. I feel it is up to each one to determine how they feel secure and what they should do to feel secure. Also, having said that feeling secure is a state of mind, only I have control over my mind. Maybe shared security can apply for close friends and your loved ones but not so much for the society and community. Even in this current Covid situation for example, irrespective of what society does or not, it is up to me to take necessary precautions and stay safe
2) I feel only emotional security can be shared - for example, the care I show to my family, the efforts I put in for my friends, all make them feel secure when I am concerned. Same way, love from my family and friends, bonding, the assurance that they will be there for me, will make me feel secure In an economic sense, financial security means having enough disposable income to cover any future expenses that you can envisage, including emergencies and contingencies. For example, your child's college education fund, emergency health expenses, funds to cover any accidents (God forbid!)...

In an emotional sense, financial security is peace of mind, a sense of relief as though you've been carrying something heavy and you finally have a chance to unload it and relax. There are two things that we need. A good retirement plan and a good low risk plan to grow our money. The only reason we are putting it off is the risk factor. Investments always come with a high degree of risk and the thought of losing it all is very scary Financial planning, education (looking to make customers aware) and experience (140 years).

Principal comes across as a company that seeks to educate the investor, make them aware of facts before helping them make decisions and holding their hands in uncertain times. Their offerings seem pretty similar to other companies' products, there is no clear differentiation. Maybe the focus for now is assuring the customer so they do not pull out their funds. There was nothing that put me off nor was there anything that interested me, except for the 'Find a dentist' in the quick links section - made me wonder if they specialize in dental insurance. Their CSR page was a letdown though - they had a picture that told a story but all they had listed was some very generalized facts.",Boston,
373143,John,Ciccarelli,jeciccarelli@avid.org,"The first brand that comes to mind is Build-A-Bear Workshop, in large part because of their charitable donations and commitment to brightening the lives of kids. We've gotten in the habit of taking our kids into one of their brick-and-mortar stores for each of their birthdays, and in that time, we've had the chance to get to learn a little more about the graciousness of the company. Their many donations of bears demonstrate the extent to which their brand is dedicated to giving back and spreading joy. In terms of why I drew it this way, I created a sketch in PowerPoint because no one, and I do mean no one, should be subjected to viewing one of my scattered drawings. Stick figures, chicken scratch...not pretty!

Everything begins with monthly conversations with my spouse about how we're each feeling about our financial security. Heading into those discussions, we are both going through our own internal contemplation and day-to-day pulse checks around our comfort levels. The questions that we focus on during our conversations are included in the drawing below. If we are able to answer each of those affirmatively, then we feel secure.

The disposable income and retirement considerations will always reign supreme, but it really is a combination of those four questions that guides our discussions and factors into our feeling of financial security. If I was creating that diagram 10 years ago, it would have been much, much more simplistic. It really would have boiled down to just ensuring that I had enough weekly to be making it by in terms of food, housing, and a little extra disposable income. Retirement would not have been a consideration at all, and I would have been more reliant on other family members to be there for me than the other way around.

My mindset toward ""feeling secure"" has matured as I have. It has become much more reliant upon communal factors and feelings than individual ones, too.

Getting married and having kids was the greatest turning point, in the best way possible. In my spouse, I now have a partner to work through those crucial decisions with. Together, our decisions are most strongly guided by making sure that we're in a position as our family to be able to care for and provide for our children in all the ways that they need.

The greatest impact has just been in terms of the amount of time and energy that goes into all financial considerations. It really is a process now - a joint one - and one that we take very seriously. Due to the current global landscape, we've really shifted our mindset even further toward saving. Since there's really not a recent precedent for what we're going through right now that we can draw on, we want to be on the safe side and ensure that no matter how the economic landscape further shifts and is impacted, we're as ready for it as we can be.

The greatest impact in the near-term has been dialing in on our leisure spending, but that's also coincided with just being home more, which has increased our spending on utilities. We've been playing more board games and cooking more meals at home, which keeps us close and helps reinforce a feeling of togetherness during these uncertain times. I think the retirement portion of my diagram will always be the one that I feel most insecure about, just because there's so many unknowns with that one in comparison to the others. Will we both work as long as we currently plan to? Will the amount that we're able to put into retirement drastically shift from year to year, to the point where we're feeling like not enough is being stored up? Will occurrences with our kids at any point leading up to retirement impact what that savings looks like? These are all questions that my spouse and I are constantly contemplating.

Short of a financial windfall, I'm not really sure there's much that would ease those feelings of insecurity around retirement. One thing that could help though is consistent reassurance from a reliable financial advisor. Just that confirmation from someone with expertise in the field that we're well positioned to head into that chapter of our lives with a feeling of security would ease some worries for us. I wholeheartedly agree with that hypothesis. It's a constant, in-flux feeling for us that ebbs and flows as the events in our life do, too. A lot of the time, it really is just a feeling, or gut-check, that my spouse and I either feel or don't. There are far too many factors outside of our control to be able to view it as strictly an end goal that can only be achieved if A, B, and C (and D, E, F...) fall perfectly into place. I think it's also reflective of being a state of mind because two people or two families could be in near-identical places financially but feel entirely different about their financial security, depending upon a host of factors and internal considerations. The absolute most vulnerable and insecure point for me was my freshman year of college. I was living on my own for the first time and quickly needing to adjust to the realities of balancing all facets of life, like classes, work, housing, and budgeting. It reached a point during the middle of that first quarter (we were on a quarter system, which amplified the class concerns, since there were just 10 weeks before the start of the next quarter) where I just felt completely overwhelmed  and had so many more questions than answers. I didn't know if I could make it in that environment, and state of finances was a large part of that. There wasn't necessarily a tipping point or a single event that brought on that avalanche of emotions, but it was just this overwhelming feeling of self-doubt, and it soared in like a wave. I kept asking myself: ""If I'm feeling like this in the first handful of weeks in this environment, how am I going to keep things in order for four years?""

In terms of overcoming it, I did what I had done many times before and leaned on a good friend who was a few years older for guidance. He'd been through similar circumstances not that long before, so I really felt like I needed his perspective more than anything. He passed along a blueprint that had really aided him (it was a spreadsheet that he used to budget his time and budget his finances). By the end of my freshman year, I had made a few tweaks to it, but I was still actively using it and continued doing so for the next several years after. What I think helped more than anything was just his acknowledgment of ""I've been there. What you're going through isn't out of the ordinary. I got through it, and you will, too."" That support was really the first action that started chipping away at my feelings of insecurity.

I think I could have handled it differently by doing a better job of preparing early on for that seismic shift of moving away to college. I could have gathered more info and used the wisdom of the network around me during the summer before moving away. Dropping the ball on that taught me a lot, though, about not being afraid to lean on the advice of those you trust, as well as experts in the field, and making an effort to serve in that role for others when I'm able. 

Very happy to say that a feeling of insecurity to that degree hasn't happened again since. I think it has a lot to do with weathering that storm and using it as a growing experience. Again, building up a comfort with leaning on others for support and guidance has really been helpful, as has being able to serve in that support and guidance role for other friends and family members. There's really no substitute for the knowledge around one's own strength that comes from going through those life experiences. I'm a big believer in the idea of ""shared security."" I think everyone experiences it in different ways throughout each phase of their life, too. When you're young, I think many kids are reliant upon their parent, or guardian, or grandparent to give them that sense of security and that reassurance that everything is okay. It comes full circle when you have kids of your own. Even when you're a teenager and young adult, and you start to feel like you're finding your independence, there's a lot of times where you're still part of that larger familial unit and there's a reliance on one another in different situations.

My own security has a direct impact on my spouse and kids, especially in how they feel. They look to me, especially my kids, for that comfort and reassurance that things are alright. My security is just as equally shaped by them, too. If one of them has fears or reservations, that's going to impact how I feel. As a result, even if I were to have this pristine sense of security for myself, it would still be completely dependent upon the feelings of security that the rest of my family is experiencing, for better, worse, or anything in between. Financial security means that my spouse and I feel comfortable and confident with our current financial environment. It's that feeling of reassurance from one month to the next that we're in a good position to be handling all of our expected expenses, as well as any unanticipated ones that may arise. If we're having one of our normal periodic conversations around finances, we're both at a place where we're feeling secure when we're able to say that we feel comfortable for one another and for our kids that everything is currently in a good spot with our finances. Sometimes, it just takes one small thing for those feelings of insecurity to creep in and for us to need to evaluate our spending and saving habits. One thing that I know would make us feel more financially secure, but we've just continually put off is starting a 529 plan for our kids. Putting efforts toward dedicated saving for their educational futures is something that my spouse and I have frequently discussed, but we've kept dragging our feet on the formal process. There's not really a grand reason of why we haven't initiated that; it's more that something else has always seemed to just take precedent over it as being the important item to take care of in the immediate. The fact that I'm mentioning it here and that we consistently come around to discussing it really does tell me that it's something we should get a move on. The three words that I would use to describe Principal are: knowledgeable, dependable, and considerate. Knowledgeable because I always feel like the information I'm receiving is well-informed and coming from a place of expertise, dependable because they've shown themselves to be quick to respond to any inquiries, and considerate because I get the sense that they value my opinions and have an interest in mine and my family's well-being.

I have a very favorable opinion of Principal, from the scan of their website, but more importantly, from previous interactions. I think with some financial institutions, they can give off an air of intimidation or detachment, but you don't feel that from Principal's website; it's very inviting, which is refreshing.

Nothing on the website put me off, and the same holds true in previous interactions with them.

Their ""Explore Life & Money"" section has always peaked my interest and provided helpful resources. The ability to filter articles in that section, depending upon the topic I'm interested in or my current situation, is also much appreciated.",Boston,
373142,Eric,Postal,docdiomedes@gmail.com,"I can't think of any particular brand that I'd say I respect in the same way I'd respect a worthy person or sociopolitical cause...but as business-ventures go, Facebook strikes me as more respectable than most at the moment.

They found and tapped into a demand that hadn't really been recognized, and made themselves the go-to for it. Then then found ways to massively profit from that without being too terribly tacky about it...and, for the most part, the people partaking of it aren't actually paying for their use/enjoyment. Although their information (and in some cases privacy) is being sold, in a lot of ways the company's services to them come across as altruistic.

Meanwhile, as everything gets politicized, FB is doing a reasonably good job in remaining neutral...rather than pandering and panicking in pursuit of every last penny of revenue that many other companies would fear to lose. I have to admit, your mentioning a ""pyramid"" at the beginning of your list probably predisposed me.

It does make sense to me, though: My concept of security is akin to structural integrity of one's life. A stronger foundation lets it get built higher, and leaves more options for the future.

For that to happen, it's best to have as established a base as possible in one's past. Paid-off debts, completed projects, earned credentials, strong references and relationships.

On top of that is a layer of similar things, but in the present: When your background is a rock-solid, reliable support for your current-day situation, you are best suited to take care of whatever current tasks, obligations, or chosen pursuits you're now facing.

If you do indeed make this layer as strong as your past-foundation, you have the best chance of building the next level: Taking on future responsibilities or selecting new goals. Knowing that the degree I'm working on today will enable me to have a great career for the rest of my life will give me far more security than if I have no game-plan.

Then, at the very top, if other levels permit, is one's reserve: Time, resources, energy, etc. to take on optional extras. Enjoying the fruits of one's labor. If, for instance, my past and present endeavors have enabled me to land a job that will give me 2 weeks' vacation more than some other work, the top of my ""pyramid"" will include an extra two weeks each year to travel, enjoy a ""staycation,"" or even work those weeks for extra income to put towards other things of interest. I might not have put the top layer on the diagram...I might have considered the ""reserve"" of resources as simply to be lumped in with my future-needs/wants. This is probably very common; as folks get older and successfully build their past and present foundation, they come to more appreciate the value of ""stopping to smell the roses,"" or at least intending to do so in the visible future rather than ""someday.""

Other than that, I think my only real changes along the way have been as I have gone from hoping/planning on building my foundation to actually  having successfully done it. A career such as mine (in medicine) kind of requires such planning; one starts prepping for medschool before college. Nothing is preventing me, other than the limitations of a 24-hour day, 8 of which are best reserved for sleep and some more of which needed for things like exercise, eating, etc. If I could have a magical few extra hours or days in the week, of course that would be even better...but at this point I am happily focused on the top two layers of my pyramid. I don't think I have any insecurity anymore, at least until/unless society has a major collapse in which case all bets would be off. Absolutely. No matter what someone labels as necessary benchmarks for security, I think, upon achieving them, he'd set up new goalposts down the field...or, failing, he'd retrench and establish new goals instead. I'm probably not going to be very original in referencing the COVID-related shutdown. The work I do is hourly, so when there was less work to be had, my income plummeted, and could easily have been zero. I have a hefty mortgage, not to mention recurring expenses of daily living, and on top of that I knew I would be owing taxes for 2019...also having to pay quarterly estimated taxes.

So in jeopardy were my home, my good standing with the IRS (and state tax authority), and possibly even my job if they decided they had to cut people loose.

I did everything I could think of to weather the storm: Kept eyes and ears out for news of what various levels of government were doing--which alerted me to mandated forbearance from mortgage lenders and the PPP program, which was relevant to me in light of my independent-contractor status. Reined in what expenses I could. And notified my employer that I would be ready, willing, and able to take on extra hours whenever they had use for me--even if my regular daytime work was dried up, they should give me a call if nights or weekends became an option. Also erred on the side of reminding them of my availability too much, rather than too little.

I don't know that I could/would have done anything more/different than I did. Might it happen again? Well, the virus is on the upswing, but thus far my work has not been impacted... Bonds of family, friendship, even work-relationships certainly include elements of shared security. At the most basic level, if you're living with one or more folks, you're dealing with common resources and responsibilities.

Even if not sharing a home, family, even friends can reach out in times of need (or sometimes even in largesse if they're enjoying good fortune), and depending on the details there can be sharing of burdens or bounties.

Workplaces, too: During the COVID shutdown I mentioned in the last section, the leadership essentially asked who would be willing to accept scaled-back hours to keep things afloat. I expect that people who insisted on the letter of their contract being honors might have been given notice that they could not be kept on...but even so, there was a sense of the team drawing together for mutual benefit/survival.

Even on a broader scale: Insurance is, essentially, a matter of shared security. Everyone paying premiums is doing so because of an expectation that, should they personally experience a loss, the pool will support them. Having sufficient resources to not only meet known needs, but enough for the usual unpredictable stuff that will inevitably come along. Plus a comfortable surplus to deal with ""wants"" rather than just needs...and a reliable confidence that the flow of income will keep pace with all of this (preferably increase to allow more breathing-room and optional extras). Other than making ""partner"" in my current job and thus earning more, I can't think of anything...otherwise, I wouldn't be putting it off! I'll get to the three words after answering the other items:

Impression: Same old, same old. Nothing jumped at me that was substantially different from any other company I've known in the same field.

That's not off-putting...just not enticing either. If I were already using their services, I wouldn't be motivated to move elsewhere. If I were with a competitor, I wouldn't be motivated to see what Principal was offering.

So, three words: Standard. Sufficient. Unexciting.",Boston,
252375,Michelle,Hopper,michellehopper1981@gmail.com,"I have recently discovered the brand Patagonia. This brand has impressed me the more I learn about them, their products, their commitment to longevity in their products and the impact they have on the environment. 

They make really great, trusted products that can be recycled when finished with them. They have a guaranteed program that allows you to be completely satisfied with your products. Their return and repair policy is amazing. They just really stand behind their products and they make you feel like you are making an investment when you make a purchase. I truly trust this company and I feel assured that I am getting a great product that will last a lifetime. 

I love that they are contributing to the environment as well. They are great activists for the climate crisis we are facing. They are involved in several ways helping different communities, and groups that try to improve environmental work and are committed to long term change. This is another reason why supporting this brand is important, knowing that you can be a small part in this fight against climate change. I chose a Venn diagram for my drawing as I felt it was a good way to sho the relations between all the elements. I also used a larger circle to demonstrate the multi focal point of my view which is Freedom. I feel that when you find the flow between all the elements, you can find freedom in the sense that it is all balanced. Therefore, you are able to feel free in all aspects.

For the relation between relationships and wellness, I chose connection because I feel that it is important to build connections with people. This helps with your mental health, confidence, personal growth and development. 

I chose self care for the relation between wellness and finances because I feel that you have to invest a little to gain a lot. Whether it be, a membership to a gym, club or other, investing in quality foods, education, or body care, you will benefit from the rewards. 

I chose experiences for the relation between relationships and finances as I believe we have to invest in time away together. Time as a family, time as a couple and time alone. So, 10 years ago I was newly married, and didn't have any kids. We owned our home and consumed a lot of 'things' to fill our home. We hosted friends a lot, travelled little, binged watched a lot of television, didn't really take care of our bodies well and don't really have a whole lot of great experiences to share. We were kind of boring. 

My drawing 10 years ago probably wouldn't be so serious. I say serious because now I know how important all these elements are to me today. I doubt that I even really thought about what feeling secure meant back then. I mean, I've always felt that having a steady job and owning our home was necessary to feel secure but in terms of the holistic side of it, that realization came much later. After we had kids.

I remember one night my husband and I were having a glass of wine (or 2 or 3) and he asked me what I thought helped shape who I was. At the time, this seemed like a deep question. He was asking me this because we had been going through life with two young children, with him hardly home and me struggling with both kids day in and day out. 

This was the beginning of the new way of how I thought of myself moving forward. It was like a door opened into self awareness, growth and happiness. I mean, there has been a lot of reading, practice and developing in between but it has been a very enlightening journey that I am still on. From then on, we have spent a lot of time questioning our purpose, our desires, our actual needs, and really understanding each other and wanting to gain the most we can out of our lives. Self doubt. There will always be that little voice inside saying that it'll be hard, what if it doesn't happen, when you fail etc. 

But, I'm learning to train my mind, having a better Mindset. Training to always push harder and look forward to those rewards. 

More recently in any of my setbacks, I have noticed a shift where, if i had taken one step back, I have made 3 steps forward. 

This is how I know I am growing, I'm getting stronger. This is how I know I can reach my potential. I know I can teach my children what it means to never give up on yourself. I have a fear of losing a connection with my children when they are older. When children are young, they look up to you, they hold you on a pedestal and think the world of you. Somehow, that goes away when kids grow up. And I am afraid of that happening with my two children. 

I can only hope that by the connections we make with them while they are young we will build that foundation that will last a lifetime. But people can change, and they are their own people. Yes! Completely. Like I said, it is a multi focal approach in how I see it. There must be a balance in all the things you believe in and the freedom will come. Feeling secure is a feeling of feeling free. My biggest insecurity my whole life has been my self Image and self confidence. They go hand in hand. I have been plus size since I can remember. 

One of my worst memories is travelling with friends to a resort and feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin that I didn't even want to put on a bathing suit. The other women were wearing two pieces and I felt like a whale compared to them. I tried finding a bathing suit that covered up my midsection and upper thighs so I would be able to fit in the beach scene at least. I knew I had to wear summer type clothing as it was so hot. Summer dresses were hard to wear as I was so self conscious about people seeing how big I felt in my legs and arms. I'm sure it was obvious how uncomfortable I was. I was always fidgeting, shifting my position, adjusting my clothing to try to make it look better. Very embarrassing. 

This was an ongoing issue for many years.  I had some success with various eating/dieting/excercise programs over the years but the weight would eventually come back on and the self confidence never really improved. You can see how self doubt plays a  huge role here. It's cyclical. 

So fast forward several years to when my husband asked me that question about what I thought helped shape who I was. This was the turning point for me. This is when I really started looking at things differently, understanding that I need to take care of my self and to make changes in my life to improve my well being. 

I made a promise to myself, that by the age of 40 I would be 40, fit, and fabulous. I was 35 at the time so I called it the 5 year plan. I started by reading self help books, joined some accountability groups, dialed in my nutrition, Implemented an exercise routine, talked to people about my challenges and planned a ton! Planning is the key to success. I found that after having children, I became more confident in sharing personal experiences and how I presented myself. 

My well being and happiness journey has been a roller coaster today the least. But I can say, that I have never felt better this past year. There have been many influences that have helped me through some more personal challenges but I truly feel as though I have conquered them and they are in my past. (This past weekend, I wore that two piece bathing suit and rocked it!) I just turned 39 so I have 1 more year to fine tune any parts that I feel need improvement. 

Looking back, I just wish that I learned how to love myself early on. This is something I'll continue to teach my children. I've been a bit stumped on this one. 

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I think there are many ways we can share security.

Through a partnership, whether it's a marriage, business, co-worker, or friendship. Through a community, in schools, workplace or groups you are a part of. 

I think it depends on what the shared goals are. The idea being you are sharing security as a whole, together. 

I think influences are a powerful things. We are always influenced by others in one way or another. I think having a positive mindset allows you to share your personal security with others through your actions and words. I think that this contributes to a feeling of security by others when they feel safe around you and can trust you. 

The same goes the other way around. I try to align myself with people whom I feel make the right choices, have good intentions, similar beliefs, and who make me feel comfortable and safe. Financial security means a long term investment for my future. I want to feel secure for my future interests, my children's future and for my retirement.

For me, it started with securing permanent employement with my current employer. This allows me to feel comfort know that I'll have a steady income to support my family. It has allowed me to get a mortgage on my home, it allows me to put some money away for my future and my retirement savings. To be honest, I don't think there is anything else we would need to do. I feel in pretty good shape with how our finances are right now. Trusted - the amount of years speaks for itself. 140 years! Wow
Caring- it looks to me that they are interested in your best interest 
Guidance- because they want to guide you in the right direction securing your future

I get the impression that they know what they are doing (I mean, over 6 hundred billion) they are confident, genuine and truly want to help people reach their potential for  finance security.  

I like that they have shareholder services. This is exactly how I see the shared security playing out with a company.",Boston,ISFJ
235035,Sean,Little,sean.patrick.little@gmail.com,"This is a hard one. Honestly, I can't think of a brand I really respect at the moment that stands out. Brands seem to glob onto anything in the moment, and once one jumps in the pool they all jump in the pool and pretend like they've been there since day one. Especially in today's age, I've seen so many companies do the right thing finally after holding out, or conversely go all in on a cause because they're afraid to not be part of the buzz around it, that it's impossible to know who is sincere and what their real feelings are. One brand might be Ben and Jerry's because they have a bit of an attitude of ""F it, this is us. If you don't like it, don't use us."" I realize most corporations don't want to deal with fickle opinions and a (generally) idiotic populace, but I do respect a company that just calls it like it is even though I know Im probably in the minority. Just nice to see some back bone from a company, especially if they're a trailblazer on a clearly virtuous cause So I didn't draw it because I'm an awful artist. Believe me, it's good I didn't. 

The sandwich below represents the elements of feeling secure for me in a few ways. For me, it's less about the specific ingredients and more about how they all come together. 
Things like a nice apartment/house, a job you are passionate about, a clear path forward with a paycheck in the short term. That's the meat of the sandwich. They are what you notice off the bat and probably what takes up the largest portion of your attention and concern in the short term. The condiments and fixings are a supportive partner, a side hustle, passion project, and anything else that's nice to have in addition, but they cost extra. Extra time, extra money, etc. and while they make it much, much more palatable they are usually the first to go if you lose that security. Finally, the good old bread. The bread is more than just one thing when it comes to security, it's the core elements that will make the rest hard to achieve if you are lacking them. It's a mixture of ingredients that sustain you while also allowing you to selfishly ignore them for the more attractive ingredients you really want and you're really buying the sandwich for. It's savings, the roof over your head, the ability to spend a little time and money else where on pursuing the things that make you happy, as emotions make a lot of security and if you aren't happy you aren't secure. You can't buy a sandwich without the bread (let's ignore gluten-free for now), and while no one wants a struggle sandwich (bread and mayo if you're lucky), you can get buy having just those less glamorous ingredients. But if you don't have the good luck. And in the end, in my opinion, a sandwich is the best metaphor because while a pyramid or complex chart probably details all this more articulately, I wouldn't even feel strongly enough about a pyramid or chart that I'd want to eat it. I would have gotten more complex with it, I would have probably tried to add more than it needed. My feelings changed since to value and find that there's security in simplicity and something you know well, the tried and true. I've had many, many turning points from failed relationships and jobs to successes in personal endeavors and just plain lucky outcomes to things. I realized that the simpler you keep it, and they better job you do of keeping it within your sphere of influence and understanding, the better you'll do and the more secure you'll be in the final outcome. Knowing this hasn't made my life perfect but it's allowed me to find the elements that are worth the most to me and cherish them more. Currently, financial issues are preventing me from feeling more secure. Personal life, professional life, relationship, all of that has gotten much better but financially it's been a hard last 18 months or so for various reasons, but I knew that. Previously I was a bit more financially secure but really not happy with personal life, my relationship, and most of my professional life. I started to change things started with the biggest block I had in front of me (relationship) followed by personal hurdles and then professional. While all of that cost me money and set me back a good amount it's had a large positive impact on me. While I still have moments of insecurity, Im much more content with my life on the whole than I was a year ago. I had to realize that security in some aspects can cause instability in others, and that catalyst for instability will start to bleed out into other parts of life until it impacts everything. I would say a portion of the outside, the savings. My savings took a big hit but that's something that I can work back from and accrue over time. You can't get back time and can't change the impact that prolonged periods of unhappiness can cause. I would have to lower a few bills or make a bit more to help this change, but I'm already on my way with both things so now it's just sticking to the game plan. I would agree. I think if you shoot for security or think ""this one aspect of my life is what I need to go all-in on to feel secure"" you'll never really feel that way. Your life and what makes it up is like a garden. You can't just water one part of it and expect to have a thriving, dynamic life that's well rounded and fulfilling. Even then, if you are happy with the outcome and happy with the results then you'll feel secure. I feel that this is especially true if you try to stay well rounded. You may not have the most of one thing, but if you have enough of the important things you'll come out feeling secure and happy. I've felt insecure in many ways. I think one of the last time I felt very insecure about something was when I had a show (DJing at a festival) and I hadn't gotten the time to prepare for it like I would have liked. I felt rusty and unprepared, which made me feel insecure about my performance and how I would be received. In addition, one of the people with me was the type of person who would get very anxious about things and alleviate their anxiety by trying to tell you what to do, or constantly change what they or doing (or what you're doing) instead of just sticking with what you know and trusting in your skill and talent. I felt really down and nervous, which I never really felt before shows, and it impacted how I started off big time. Eventually, I reminded myself that I knew what I was doing and I didn't need to be worried about things. I politely told the person I that was causing me more anxiety than I needed them to leave me alone for a while, just to go off somewhere where I couldn't see them as they were making it worse. Once I was out of my head and no one else was in it either it was all good. Looking back I would have prepared more and done a better job of it, but I also would have been more confidant in my abilities and not let anyone else undermine my confidence. Since then I haven't dealt with the issue, at least not as large of a feeling of insecurity as I remember to trust myself and the process more. I do think that shared security is real. Being surrounded by people that share the same mindset and also challenge you to better yourself and grow is key. They help push you forward and remind you to be better / find more security when it feels like it's hard to find that on your own. People can tear you down but also lift you up. In my own life I definitely receive help with feeling secure from the people I surround myself with, and if they don't help then I don't involve them in my life. That doesn't mean I only want to spend time with ""yes"" people, but instead with people who have my best interest in the long term in mind. This also applies the other way around, where I try to offer the same to the people that matter to me. Financial security means I have enough in my savings and bank account to feel good about today and tomorrow, that I could weather a small storm and plan for a future. Taking on more work opportunities in consulting would bring in more money and make me more financially secure, but I put it off because I know that there's a limit to what I can do, and doing too much at once is a mental detriment. I also have a good amount of stock in a company I worked at from day one that has grown and done very very well. I have had offers to buy me out from investors etc, and if I did so it would totally erase all my debt and leave me with a decent chunk of savings left over. I never agree though, not only because I think they company will continue to do very well into the future causing the value to increase, but because I think it would be a bit of the easy way out and hurt me in the long run in some ways. It's a hard trade-off, I could have some more security financially and mentally now, but I know myself and I would wish I held to my convictions and didn't sell at this point if I did.

My initial impression was positive. I went into the site and read more info, specifically the company profile which mentioned some interesting aspects of the company (and I wish it was said in a place that you didn't have to download the data from it first). There's a lot to offer and lots of info, but I'm still not really positive how much they walk the walk vs talk the talk like corporations do. 
Nothing really put me off but I didn't really find anything that grabbed me and made me say ""ok, that's something I like and agree with"", but instead it gave me the impression that they were trying to be the friendlier option in the pack. 
What stood out and I did think was interesting was offering learning resources for financial education right on the front page. It would be great to see that targeted towards younger people as well so financial literacy starts sooner.'",Boston,

One that I consider a ""disruptor"" is TESLA, but it still has a long to to prove they're doing something for a large portion of the human population. To me, security is  this feeling of me at the center of my life, and teh chance to have both my mind and reach expanding outwards, finding new ideas, keeping myself well-grounded and having ever-bigger ""wings"" (the will to achieve). I false believed ""security"" menat containment and building a ""safe enviroment"" around me, very few people or a couple brands could ever reach. It was completely neurotic, I know.. but security meant ""being in total control;"" which, of course, is tantamount to fight a loosing battle. To me, feeling safe was this unachievable ideal of reaching a psosition where I could determine what the ""best"" of everything was for me and then just have access it by the means required, Not counting the absolutely impossible to forseee (like the scopre and nature of the COVID19 pandemic), the only thing that would make me feel less secure than I am now, woudl be loosing my capacity to generate an income to have my bare necessities covered. Also, should my insurance policies change too drastically and not allow me to save for my retriement... I'd feel unnerved, for sure. As previously discussed, I'd only feel more insecure if I lose my capacity to make a living or growing old and despondent. I'm used to ""rough living""... but that's not something I'd want to go through again, much less in my old age.

If I can make sure I get enough income to generate decent savings, all the while having a helath insurance policy to prevent me from going broke before I croak, that small element of insecurity would certainly banish. Exactly.e life

""Feeling"" is the keyword for me. As long as I can generate circumstances that allow me to not feel anxious or wary about my PRESENT, then I will be safe enough to leave something for my life in the future. To me, making ""security"" a goal... would be tantamount to set an ever-moving goalpost, as there are too many impoderables to face throughout our lifetimes, and these will make any ""sound strategy"" crumble down like a house of cards. After all, ""no battle plan survives contact with the enemy,"" as they say. Still, some plans are way better and more achievable than others, I was angry, for a long time, due to family problems that led me to grow up quite fast and never truly had time to sort out and get rid of all the baggae I was carrying. My anger led to bursts of violence (verbal) and an inability to accomodate other people's needs or requirements, so getting a job that paid well and allowed me to relax was... stressful, to say the least. I felt alone and yet, it was me who was unable to reach a compromise, so the hurting frustration only got worse.

As far as handling it different, I was 12 years old... maybe if I shouldn't have woken up to stop the violence at home... maybe I woudl have remained the meek guy doing what his parents todl him and I'd be something other than an author. Maybe. But that moment I felt all security I ever had come crashing down... my family was in tailspin, crashing and burning... and I had nowhere else to go.

Over the years, as prone as I was to violente responses, I have worked to make these less and less recurring, and if they happen to clearly state and show these are directed at me and not to the people around me. When people annoy me, I disengage and take time apart from them (as long as I feel necessary) before reconsidering if I want to go back and make the concious effort to continue my relationship with said person as long as I do not contribute to create a situation like that again... if at all possible.

Also, to make this more practical, I have foudn a way to make a living that is not dependant of others' decisions (self-employed). It's harder sure, but this way I do not feel insecure while trying to ""please"" a boss that's too set on their ways to allow for creativity, autonomy or out-of-the-box thinking to provide solutions. I have confidence in cooperation and mutual support. While I may not see eye to eye with someone, I can still work with them to increase our wellbeing. That's what my current family and circle of friends is about.

If anyone can chip in in whatever manner they can, we as a group grow ""stronger"" and the diversity in ideas and ways, allows for a fluid ""nucleus"" where we all can feel secure.

Aslong as partners and friends remain a positive influence and supportive of our collective effort,I feel more relaxed and thus, a lot more secure. The ability to... relax.

I don't need to strain to cover my basic needs. I can devote myself to live and do my job instead of working instead of working to be able to live.

Financial security means I don't need to fret about money in the case of an eventuality. I have enough saving and coverage to meet such contingencies shoudl they come (initially, at least.) Other than having enough capital to open my own restaurant or cafe, I don't feel I'm putting off anything.

They have a reputation as a bit of hippy-dippy company, but that is really just a lazy label that discounts their work as a champion of progressive causes and leaders. Not satisfied to just be an ice cream company, their website currently features above-the-fold messaging like ""Dismantle White Supremacy"" and ""5 Ways To Talk About Criminal Justice Reform at Your Family Gathering."" On the corporate level, they were one of the first companies to address disparity in employee compensation by limiting the pay of their CEO to no more than 5x the amount of their lowest-paid employee. That number edged upward and eventually went away when Ben & Jerry's was acquired by Unilever, but in leading the charge way back in the 80s, they started a conversation almost no one was having at that point. I've drawn my ""House of Security,"" providing a window into an idealized, stable vision of what you might see if you were to peer into a strong, perfect house. 

There is no foundational floor here as I don't believe any single building block must be in place in order to achieve a sense of security, but when allotted in the right amount, these building blocks represent what I think would be a harmonious balance. 

Money, of course, is an essential part of feeling secure. If you don't have it, it's hard to take care of your family. However, you can have a happy and healthy family with less money than you'd like (if you're lucky.)

Purpose can mean work, or simply what drives you to wake up each morning. Ideally, you find some purpose connected to your work, but I think it's also possible to find purpose in something that doesn't help you make enough money to survive. 

Service can be part of work, depending on what your work is, but if you're making enough money, have a healthy family and a purpose, contributing to society in some sort of benevolent, unselfish way can also be an integral part of societal health, which by extension will add to your personal security. Service can also be your purpose. I'm not sure I would have included much more than ""Money"" on this diagram ten years ago. 

""Feeling secure"" now encompasses many different facets of my life, and I realize that money is but one contributing factor to my feeling secure.

It's still a challenge, but the fact that I'm able to identify ""purpose"" and ""service"" as pillars of feeling secure has allowed me to become a more useful person in this world. I've been trying to become a professional film and TV writer since I came out of college, basically. I've made a much more concerted effort to get there in the last ten years, but my sporadic success means that I've lacked the financial stability of my more successful peers. That particular vocation is also the only thing I've identified in my life as being truly purposeful to me from an artistic and spiritual standpoint. 

This lack of success continues to drive me forward, but when you chase a dream that remains just out of reach for half your life, it's hard not to let doubt creep into your brain that infects your larger world. I feel most insecure about money. Thinking back to the last question, I still feel confident that film and TV writing is my purpose, but I am insecure about how my current lack of success has resulted in sporadic employment. I'm not the main breadwinner of the house, and if that responsibility was mine and mine alone, our family would not have financial security. 

I need to buckle down and work harder to achieve my professional goals. Sometimes I feel like they're just out of reach and I'm a short jog behind them, but I need to find the motivation to break into a full-on sprint and catch them. I do agree. I realize that once you find your purpose, it may not be a thing that provides you with security for the rest of your life. Just like money and financial security can be fleeting, I think it's possible to chase down your dreams, catch them, and realize they weren't really what you wanted after all.

That thought doesn't keep me up nights or anything, but I'm also mindful that the path to success and security is likely a road you need to keep climbing. New checkpoints will be defined and emerge as you continue your journey. When I was in my 20s, I had been working for a record label for a few years and felt confident that I would be receiving a raise and a promotion imminently (I know). Banking on what I felt was a certainty, I decided to move into a very nice two-bedroom apartment in a brownstone building on the Upper West Side in New York. I couldn't afford it without the raise I thought was getting, and as the months went by, I began to max out my credit cards in order to pay for a lifestyle I couldn't afford while using every cent of cash I had to pay my rent. Eventually, I had maxed out all of my cards and could only afford the minimum payments (which were a stretch) and was quickly underwater. A few months in, every day felt like it started with a panic attack, and I soon became unable to pay for my utilities. Rent was usually weeks late, which came with its own penalty, and I could only afford it when I borrowed from the paycheck I should have been using for the following month's rent. 

a. I panicked first! A couple months into the financial calamity of my own making, I still held out hope that a raise would be coming soon. It never did. To my discredit, I also never changed my lifestyle, kept taking my girlfriend out, and lied to my roommate about my financial situation. After about six months, I had to break my lease, move out and get into another apartment that was almost half the price, staying there until I was able to begin a long recovery from financial insolvency.
b. I used to have a very unhealthy relationship with money. I still do in many ways, but at least now I realize it and can act accordingly to save myself from my very worst impulses. For some reason, when I was in college and got my first credit card, my dad told me ""abuse your credit for all its worth."" Terrible, terrible advice that he has since disavowed, but it stuck with me for a long time. If I were to do it all over again, I would have never moved into an apartment that I couldn't afford with the money I was earning, but moreover, I would have sought to get into a place that was even cheaper to get a jump start on the long process of healing from years of credit abuse. 
c. No, it hasn't happened again -- at least not to this degree. When I moved out to California about nine years ago, I bought my first new car -- a beautiful Mini Cooper that I felt wasn't too extravagant -- and agreed to a deal that allowed me to keep my payments under a certain arbitrary amount. I didn't pay much attention to the fact that after six years -- when most people would have paid off their car -- I would have to refinance another large principal and keep paying for the car for many years. Luckily, I never got to that point. My wife helped me get out from under the balloon payment when we traded in the Mini for a more family-friendly car. I definitely lost a lot of money in the deal, but it has taught me that I should not make any decisions about financial transactions that are in excess of ten bucks or so. 1. I like the idea of shared security; that's why it's so important to support your community and elevate those who need help. A stronger community increases everyone's security. 

2. When I'm feeling secure, it makes me happier and more confident which in turn inspires feelings of confidence and security in my family. Conversely, my wife is quite often the primary breadwinner in our house, so she is the one responsible for our family's financial security. While she is in that position, I feel like it's important to project confidence that I am secure in my ability to help and support my daughter while she's busy working. Financial security means having enough money to pay your bills while still being able to save enough money to plan for emergencies (unemployment, medical, unforeseen) or to pad a nest egg to fund future large purchases (houses, college education). I don't know that there is one thing I've been putting off to make me more financially secure. I've pared down my expenses to a pretty minimal amount. 

Right now, my surest path to financial security is consistent employment, but I try to change that situation every day. Direct. Helpful. Serious. 

I like that all of the pictures reflected younger people, or people with young kids, rather than the standard empty nester/retirees you might normally see when a company in this same segment advertises. They have a core group of services that is simply communicated, but they're addressing the current, pressing issue above the fold. 

I'm not put off by it, but the amount and shade of blue that they use reminds me a little bit of Prudential. That may be by design, however.

Because I don't go to websites like these a lot, I am interested in using their Retirement Wellness Planner to see how I'm doing.",Boston,
225817,Susan,Moon,smoon1211@gmail.com,"I wish I had more brands to reference in response to this question, but for every one brand that stands for what they are doing, it seems a dozen brands are not passing muster. That said, lately Ben & Jerry's comes to mind. The founders have been tireless in showing up and rallying / mobilizing around the movements that matter, such as Black Lives Matter. Ben & Jerrys has mostly been consistent on several levels to amplify their stance: on the founder level, the product level, the communications level, etc Other brands / founders / creative directors that come to mind are Phillip Lim and Laura Kim (Oscar de la Renta) who seem to be engaging with current movements on a personal and sincere level, and using their platforms to further amplify. My visual for security starts at the core with the essentials (outer circle) such as food, clothes, a place to live; and then is divided by the more extrinsic expectations surrounding security on the left side, and intrinsic needs on the right. I drew it this way because I feel there is a big difference in how the two sides of security are attained / fulfilled, and they can sometimes work synergistically, or can work in a way that sabotages the other side of security. On the intrinsic side, I'd argue that the support network of friends / family / chosen family and connection to a divine purpose beyond oneself are most important. On the extrinsic side, I'd argue that health insurance may be most important, and also 'title / status' gives clout and credence when navigating through the world. Ten years ago, I think I would have leaned heavily toward the ""intrinsic side"", because I didn't have a tight grasp on the value of things, nor the social currencies that have higher conversion rate than others. Since then, my mindset has gotten grounded in a heavily pragmatic sense, where I am trying to navigate the external world and its impositional demands to the best of my ability without compromising my space of freedom, freedom from fear. Taken to an extreme, a security mindset can turn into a scarcity mindset versus one of abundance, where the means of material security (i.e. money) become the end and not the means. In the last 3 years, I've been working to lean more into an abundance mindset, which is something I source from the intrinsic side. The main shift that has precipitated this shift is getting married; my marriage was one met with much resistance by my family, mostly because my partner was seen as a liability to my family, and so we spent many years (8) trying to fight that perception. On the other side of things, and with more financial stability (debt free), we have been able to navigate ourselves deeper into a mindset of abundance versus scarcity, but it is certainly not easy! I left my job 5 months ago in order to give myself full permission to take a sabbatical and focus on pursuing graduate studies. After grinding in the corporate world for all my career, it has been a naked feeling to be without the security of a job title. Coming from a background where love can be conditionally apportioned out according to economic worth (i.e. salary), I can at times feel phantom judgment, but ultimately I stand by my decision (especially) in the midst of the pandemic.

Along with its other manifold reverberations, COVID-19 has offered to me a moment of clarification: it has become increasingly clear on a global scale that any semblance of control we thought we had before is an illusion we have cherished and clutched tightly. Salaries, job titles, getaway trips, acceptances to institutions and programs, weddings, funerals, graduations –– all the best laid plans, and usual milestone markers by which we define ourselves –– have all been curtailed and contained. In this space, I welcome the opportunity to be unraveled. To embrace my vulnerability as a source of strength in this moment, and not shy away from it. I think the thing I feel most insecure about would be the ""Title/status on a linear progression"" because there's some expectation that time and life decisions work linearly, especially once you've reached a 'certain age'. To change my insecurity around this, I am trying to make decisions that are more orbital than linear; I am trying to listen to my ego less (because ultimately it is my ego that wants the titles, the status, the linear progressions) and tap into a place of being endlessly curious, and open to humility. I absolutely agree. If security were an end goal, in the extrinsic sense, it would be a goal never met; security for security's sake seems to be an insatiable goal that never meets attaining, because we end up burning ourselves out. I lean towards feeling secure as a state of mind because it is something we must negotiate in our minds every day, it is not some kind of equilibrium we ever arrive to definitively, but a state of mind that requires daily discipline to dwell in. Back in 2013, I moved from my job in China back to the states, the driver being my long distance relationship. I wanted to give it a shot, and to do so, I decided at the time that I needed to move back from overseas. This was the first career decision I had made with no other assurance (job / family was also against the decision), and so I felt like an ""island whom none but beetles know"". It was especially hard because I felt like I was giving up one love (living in China) for another (relationship).

a) I think the thing that helped me most significantly during this time was getting a bike and riding through the city on it as my main way to get around. It probably seems like an odd thing, but for some reason, biking gave me a sense of strength and sufficiency that I hadn't experience prior to that point. There was a clear input that led to a clear output (pedaling to get from point A>Z) and my body mirrored the leanness of input/output as well. I felt strong and lean at that time, and felt that biking had unlocked another level to living in the city I had moved back to. 

b) I think I wouldn't have been so drastic in 'giving up my one love'–– I think I would have tried to figure out a way to stay in China or maintain a stronger connection to it somehow. I think I would have first tried to find a job back in the states before making the jump. I think I would have consulted more of my closer friends along the process. But I think overall it was a lonely time. 

c) Some of my most insecure moments seem to be tied directly back to being out of work. Back in 2016, I had left my role after successfully launching a product, and wanted to give myself some time to recuperate. However, I immediately jumped back into finding work within 2~3 weeks of leaving, because I had had a conversation with my roommate at the time, which made me feel ""wrong"" for being out of work. I wish I had given myself more time to listen to why I was feeling insecure in that moment, what about that conversation with my roommate had triggered me, so that I could focus on working that out internally instead of immediately trying to find some external answer. 1. My first thought is that I wish that ""shared security"" was more valued in our culture. I wish there was a celebration of shared security versus individual security. I wish there was more of an impetus in our culture to think of security as a network versus a singular island. I am reminded of this article (https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/) which resonated with me upon reading it. One year into marriage, I've thought how strange it is that culture encourages couples to turn inwards and focus all resource on building their own empire once crossing the threshold of marriage > family. This is strange to me because I would think that by joining two lives together, two people (versus one) would be able to absorb more risk than if it was just the one. Of course there are other scenarios that could bar this from being the case. But I've wondered why the emphasis in our culture is so much about trying to be the brightest singular star in the sky to the point of burning out and getting swallowed into the darkness. 

I think when I am able to meet others from a place of security, it is felt. And sometimes, when I am secure enough in myself, I am able to invite others to feel secure in themselves too. I say this, because I can think of a few people in my life who have been a rock; who, when I step into their presence, I am able to imagine myself with that same sense of security, and make it real. Alternatively, when I am insecure, I find that insecurity triggers insecurity. When I am insecure, I am speaking from a place of fear, doubt, rejection –– and when I speak from that place, others can detect it in an instant. I think I subconsciously modulate the levels of security / insecurity around me in my life when it comes to other people. There have been times when I have tried to be in the midst of people who lend more security than I can give. And then there have been others where I feel able to lend more security than others might have. Either way, I try to be present to the deep seated feeling of security / insecurity, and try to understand what it is that is driving it. Being around others who are wrestling through that question also helps me to better know myself. To me, financial security is about living within my means. It is about feeling lean in my saving & spending, and having enough saved up for forthcoming rainy days. In the last 2-3 years, I am trying to make a shift to automation and working with robo-investing platforms –– these also help me feel secure in knowing that these platforms are monitoring / reinvesting my resources, purely because I know if left to my own devices, I would not be as effective and likely invest in a more emotions-driven manner. Ultimately, I believe that the highest point of financial security is being able to operate from a mindset of abundance versus scarcity. Even if you are well off financially, I believe the scarcity mindset will have you feeling insecure your whole life. Investing my savings – I have built up my savings over 30 years and have allowed most of it to sit idle in savings accounts or CDs over that time. If I had just mobilized my finances even 5 years ago, I think I would have been able to grow what I have. All that to say, I am no longer putting it off. My goal is to move the majority of my savings into investments, while keeping only what I need on hand. I have arrived at this with the help of my partner, who has followed sources such as Ramit Sethi, Tony Robbins, Dave Ramsey, & Farnoosh Torabi –– and these sources have given a more prescriptive breakdown of how to allocate resource.

After a 5 minute perusal and also getting a quote for life insurance, I'd have to say that the Principal experience feels kind of generic (like a new fintech brand that is claiming to do / offer everything, including dental provision, but isn't quite specialized or strong in any one thing). The blue color and also font / icon feels quite generic for the fintech space. I'm curious what sets Principal apart from other fintech brands. There is language about ""digital investing with a human connection"" but I'm not feeling the human connection part yet. What makes it a human connection? Am I assigned to some kind of financial advisor with a first name who will walk me through something? Also, I was curious about the life insurance piece because I do not have a life insurance plan, and I was actually interested in the question being answered ""see how life insurance can protect you and family"" but it was a quite cursory breakdown (3 icons) and it just prompted me to go through the quote, which didn't give me much insight as to why I should opt to get it at this stage in my life.",Boston,
325502,Dennis,Grant,grantden@gmail.com,"I would say first and foremost Nike comes to mind as a brand that I currently respect. They have been very vocal through their ads when aligning with the fights against racism, prejudice and equality. From their partnership with Colin Kapernick and his pursuit against the racial injustices that affect people of color in this country to their creation of burkas/hijabs for Muslim women athletes, Nike has had the pulse on social issues regularly that also reflect the same values I have as a person. So I’m inside the bubble is myself. I want to be the nucleus of it all and show that my sense security is affected by things outside of me but effects me. I drew a one-way arrow coming from the center of myself to show that the first concepts closest to me are in turn closest to my sense of security. The two-way arrows represent the give and take nature of the associated concepts. 

Community- Where I live and the circumstances of my neighborhood, neighbors and how are area is policed are a big part of my physical sense of security. I live in a predominantly black community currently that has a good amount of gun violence in the general area. This coupled with police brutality, historically has made for a mistrust of police in communities like mine and negatively affects the sense of security that our community feels.

Mind- The security of the mind is relative to the content/images one sees on a daily basis. The forms of media (web, tv, radio, etc) that these broadcasts are made on articulate a message to the receiver that they ultimately interpret and determine how it makes them feel. 

Financial- The security of finances are important and play a major role into all the other categories—the ability to have stable career and finances can play a role into the communities you live in and the safety you receive from being able to afford to live in those places. 

Relationships - The relationship aspect can bring the safety of being productive if you have positive relationships and can be overall healthy too, of course depending on your relationships. 

Spiritual - Security that I derive from spirituality lends to my ability to be a productive contributor to society. The more spiritually secure I am, the better off I am to understand the feelings of others in the world. 10 years ago would’ve been somewhat different in perspective but not necessarily different in values. I was living in a different community at the time so my idea of safety in community was pretty standard and not as intense as now. Also, the financial element would still be important to me because I was an entrepreneur that found happiness in that versus relying on a career working for someone else. Overall, I felt secure 10 years ago because of key elements such as my relationships, mind and spirit remaining strong and intact. The biggest shift from then to now is the changing of my communities that I lived in and the experiences I gain(ed) from those shifts. I moved to the city of Chicago in 2008 from the far north suburbs of IL and that impact of living in higher crime areas expanded my perspective of the policing in this city and how it pertains to my sense of security. Right now I would say that my financial security is preventing me from being a bit more secure. I was one of many affected by the pandemic so my ability to save more money and move to a safer area is stymied until I can assuredly secure solid income. This is a stressful place to be but it hasn’t affected my other elements of security tremendously at the moment. The community element is my highest insecurity in this diagram due to the level of circumstances that I don’t feel I can really control. The only option I have is to change my current community through organizing and helping provide resources. The only alternative is for me to move but that will be once I get back financially secure. It can be both depending on the circumstances I suppose. I personally would like to turn the majority of my concepts in my diagram into stable arrangements that have the ability to evolve for the better. The most insecure I felt was at time in mid 2018 when I was going through a a separation period in my relationship and I lost the apartment I was living in. My spouse and I needed space and I wasn’t able to afford living in our place by myself so I had to break the lease and ultimately ended up living out my car or on friends couches when I had the chance for the next 4 months. I felt emotionally and physically insecure because I never thought in a million years that I’d be in a situation like that and I was physically vulnerable sleeping in my car in a dangerous city like Chicago, especially in the summer time. I did my best to get back on my feet by working hard and remaining as positive as possible and by October is was able to get another apartment. Looking back, I would’ve/should’ve set my pride aside and moved back to MI with my parents even temporarily to get myself back on point. It would’ve have been a hit to my ego but I would’ve been more secure physically. This hasn’t happened since then and I hope it doesn’t because I’ve done my best to learn from that situation holistically. I don’t bring the kind of energy around me that I had back in 2018 anymore in hopes to keep my evolution positive as an individual. I think that it is a valid idea because we all play a role into each other’s securities for better or worse. It’s a shared energy through environment and our activities as individuals affects the entire community overall. My own security affects my interaction within and outside my community accordingly. For example, if and when I feel secure “at home” I tend to be a more compassionate human to others that may be outside my community. On the other hand, if I’m not secure at home, I can look out the outsiders with disdain and prejudice that don’t allow me to be as compassionate a person as I could be. I feel the same goes for other people looking at me as well and utilizing their personal security to pass judgment on me, good or bad. Financial security for me means that I am able to make financial decisions comfortably that will not negatively impact my current and future quality of life. Whether this is a big financial decision or a small one, I am able to execute a plan that aligns with my current financial status. I know that I have a creative gift that I can and have monetized on before. I am good at producing music but I never felt that I had the time to really flesh it out and make it full time. I have now began to take it more serious because I have more time with the pandemic. I stay home more and my work hours have even cut so now I don’t have any excuses as to why I can’t devote time to my craft to ultimately use it to provide more financially security for me.

I got the impression that this company wants you to get the information they present. It’s easy to view and understand for me. They have a breakdown of what each topic is about and it’s clear. 
My interest was peaked by them offering both products for financial and insurance. Two things that you usually consider when working for someone.",Boston,INTJ
373145,Irene,Iwanytzkyj,irene.iwa63@gmail.com,"Natura, a cosmetics company originally from Brazil, Sao Paulo, present in Argentina. What i value about Natura is their ability to make very good products that are created with the environment in mind from the first stage of its production when they extract the active ingredients to the end product that is eco friendly.  They work hand in hand with the communities where they extract the active ingredients, respecting their culture and traditions. It is a comprehensive perspective that takes into account the environment, the local communities and the end product. 

Also, although not qualifying as a brand in itself, in Argentina we have many small entrepreneurs very aware of the environment who work with local communities and recycled products. To mention a few, there are recycled backpacks made from the fabric used for street billboards and dog food packaging, fabrics made in the north of Argentina that employ indigenous people and work with natural dye products extracted from plants (eg, beet is used for red, onion for yellow, and so on). 

What I value about these type of companies/projects is their 360 degree vision, which begins by the raw material, providing jobs for the community, and an eco friendly end product.  People that care about others. The drawing shows the order of importance of feeling secure in my life. 
Firs of all is my support system. Without the emotional cushion to process bad moments and enjoy good ones the other elements lose importance. There will be times when I will feel more secure or less secure,  I may or may not have money and may or may not have a health insurance plan to ensure that I will be well taken care of if I have a health problem. But having the emotional support to help me go through bad or difficult times is what will help me thrive in other areas and move ahead. 
In second place is my financial security, or like I like to call it ""financial freedom"". Money is certainly important. It is what makes you feel safe, what buys you food, shelter, warm clothes, education, and so much more. Even the medical insurance to pay for my healthcare. 
Medical Insurance is in third place not because health is less important than money. Health will always go first before money, but it is money that will pay for my medical insurance. But also, having healthy habits (good food, exercise, etc.) makes me feel secure as well because I feel that I am not so liable to get sick. That gives me a sense of security. Ten years ago ( a bit more actually, but not much) I was getting divorced. My number one priority then  were my children and my financial situation. Not that my health and medical insurance were not important, I just didn't have space in my head to think about my health (lucky me that I was healthy and didn't have to) At that time, my drawing would have been different. I didn't have time to think of friends or a support system (although I needed it) or other things that added to my overall wellbeing. Money and my children came first. 

I realize how my financial situation was almost the most important factor in my life at the time. Not that my children were not, of course they will always be my first priority, but earning enough money to become independent from my ex husband became my number one priority. Money played an essential role in my sense of security. Being financially independent would relieve me from having to deal with a verbally violent ad possessive ex husband. Laws in Argentina do not protect women as much as in other countries. Financial freedom allows you to make choices, to think of something you want to do and do it (of course if you have the skills to do it), it gives you good moments with your family and friends, it opens up opportunities. 
Now I have grown and learned from my past. I undertood what I did wrong and learned to take charge of my part. So that makes me a different person. Although as I mentioned in other opportunities, I am still struggling with my finanacial situation. But have learned to appreciate good friends and connecting with good people, and that is why my number one element that makes me feel secure today is my support system. If you have good friends and a good support system you can grow out of any bad situation. My financial situation is an important factor preventing me from feeling more secure. if I knew that all my bills are being taken care of my approach to life would be different. 
This situation has a great impact on my life. In very difficult times, I go to sleep worrying about my bills. Not knowing what could happen next. Looking at my diagram, what I feel most insecure about is my financial security. Why? Because my work flow has ups and downs. For this to change I need first to change my mindset. (working on it, haha). Believe in myself. And second, diversify. Think of other alternatives which I can lean on when times are difficult (have a project in progress) and that make me happy and earn money. Feeling secure is part of what it means to me to be happy and fulfilled. Feeling secure is a necessary element to be able to perform at my best. If I am worrying about paying my bills, or if I'm insecure about my health or my children, there's no way that I will be able to enjoy life as much. I will be less creative, will not perform well enough. Feeling safe and secure is an important foundation to enjoying life to the fullest. 1) Example of feeling insecure of myself with my profession. 
I was at a fundraiser event and a client of mine for whom I had already made several translations told me that his company was looking for an interpreter for a workshop. Although I have graduated from school as an Interpreter and Translator, I finally realized that simultaneous interpretation was not so appealing to me, so I would do some consecutive interpretation projects every now and then. It had been a while since I had last worked as an interpreter. I remember a friend of mine telling me that I should always say yes  (unless it is something I don't have the skills for, of course) and then I could figure out  how I would do it. Things would turn out just right. So, although I felt super insecure at the time since the workshop terminology was very specific, I said yes. I made a great effort to overcome my insecurity, my lack of confidence. And finally everything turned out just perfect. The people attending the workshop were super nice, the coach was super grateful. I felt so insecure about not knowing a certain term, or meaning, and my work was so much more than just translating words that everyone was super grateful that I was helping them overcome the cultural and language gap between them. Over time, especially after my divorce where I had to do by myself so many things I was not used to, I would take courage and do things anyway, and things would turn out perfectly well. 
When I have a similar situation today, I don't think I would handle it differently. I am quite insecure, so whenver I have to face a big challenge I will act the same way, take up courage and do it. The only difference is that from my experience, I now am certain that everything will turn out fine. And that if it doesn't, it' ok. I will learn from it and move ahead. 

Another example of feeling insecure in the past is during my divorce. My world went upside down. My ex husband was not nice to me. I was not financially independent as I quit translating (would work on and off on occasional projects) after my second child was born. That sense of insecurity, of not knowing what was going to happen next, not having a good support system,feeling very threatened,  not knowing how or where to start again while having to raise three small children. And again, the legal system in Argentina was not helpful at all. 
Looking back at this moment I would have tried to find a balance between raising my children and my work/personal life. I did not know how to integrate all these aspects, so I devoted all my time to my children. I do not regret it. But it left me very vulnerable, almost noone to turn to and no money of my own. Not a nice place to be. 
Luckily, this feeling of deep insecurity never ever happened to me again. I worked (and still are) very hard on myself to become stronger, independent and empowered. I will not allow myself to be in such a situation again 1, I very much agree with the concept of ""shared security"" . I would not be able to feel secure just by myself. There are many external factors that are necessary to my feeling of security. A very current example is the lockdown due to the pandemic. In Argentina, the lockdown was ruled on a very early stage of the pandemic (meaning, we were hardly feeling the effect of Covid19, although it was going rampant in several countries in Europe) and almost overnight. So I went from feeling safe and supported by a system that works to feeling vulnerable and insecure.  The first weeks of the lockdown I was alone, my children were at my ex husband's. During those weeks I realized that we are immersed in a society, that everyone fills in a role, and that I would not be able to survive without a system supporting me. What if supermarkets closed? What if electricity and gas would not be available? What if I could not reunite with my children because of the extremely strict controls on the streets? What if I got sick and there were no doctors or hospitals to take care of me?  I was not prepared to survive on my own. A deep feeling of insecurity took over me. 

2. As I just mentioned, I believe that my feeling of security always depends in part on some external factor or person. Sometimes, just one caring word in the right moment makes all your insecurities fade away. As Simon Sinek says, ...""courage is an external thing, the sense that someone has my back gives me the courage to do certain thing, the feeling that they would have done it for me"". So, although courage and security are not the same, when you feel safe and secure you get the courage to do certain things  I remember my daughter told me once when she was grown up already that whenever she felt scared or insecure as a child, when I said some comforting words such as ""it will be ok, you will do fine"" was enough for her to feel safe, it would mean the world to her, even though (she said) she knew that it might not be true. ( I was surprised to see how powerful the words of a mother could be) 
Having the love of my children makes me feel secure. And I know that it works both ways. I believe that giving my children a safe environment to grow up in, and by safe I don't mean just financial security but knwowing that they have a family that loves them and supports them no matter what, has played an important role in shaping them into being who they are today. It means peace of mind. Knowing that my family and I have everything we need takes of a huge weight off my back. I means that I can focus my energy on growing, spending time with my family and friends, studying, and on other interesting activities. Downsizing. My house is for sale. My plan is to sell the house, buy something smaller and save the differential which would be my safety net. 
Nevertheless, although my house is actually for sale and I am not putting it off, I don't put all the energy I should in selling it. Sometimes I feel I don't want to move to something much smaller but deep inside I know I need to step out of my comfort zone. I know that I cannot find new solutions if I keep on doing the same things. Just that sometimes it is too hard. My three words to describe Principal based on what I'v read and seen are:  solid / experienced / current in terms of employee advancement (Best Place to Work, Women in Work) 

My impression is that it is a company with a comprehensive series of packages and options (although I didn't dig deep into each of them). A web page full of information. 

I tried to find exactly what type of charity projects the company carried out and was unsucessful. It led me to a very large pdf packed with numbers and information. Maybe it was my fault and I didn't look where I was supposed to. That put me off a little bit.  Also, I feel that regarding the institutional video,  they wanted to remake it to show a more human and caring side but it didn't really work for me that much. (Sorry :))

Nothing peaked my interest in particular. Nevertheless,  in my opinion the whole page looks very well contructed.",Boston,INFP
373144,Jilleen,Ferris,jlferris6@gmail.com,"That is a tough one because I have two!  One of these two is Plaine Products.  They are a plastic free brand that makes shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, moisturizer, etc. in aluminum containers with aluminum lids.  You buy one pump for each product and reuse the plastic pump.  When you are done with the product, you send back the containers for reuse (or you can recycle them, but I prefer to send them back for them to reuse).  Plastic pollution and consumption is one of the issues that I am passionate about, and have been making efforts to change to a plastic free or reduced plastic use lifestyle.  While it is nearly impossible to eliminate all single use plastic, I am trying my best to switch out items where options are available.  Plaine products has become a staple in my personal care regimen, and I truly believe in what they stand for and are trying to accomplish with their products. First of all, I am a horrible artist, so excuse the horrible drawing.  I am in recovery (Narcotics Anonymous), and the NA symbol is the best visual that I can represent as being secure.  The symbol is a diamond inside of a circle.  The diamond represents the base of the pyramid, with the four bases representing self, God, service, and society.  The point of the top of the pyramid (which I attempted to draw a side view), is freedom.  The saying is that the wider your base (the stronger that your self, God, service and society elements are) the higher the point of freedom is.  To me, this is just balancing life and keeping your mental, spiritual and physical elements healthy.  When these things are in balance in my life, I am the most secure in every aspect. 10 years ago I only had one year clean in recovery, so I may have drawn this.  But most likely I would have picked something different because at the time, I was going back to college, raising a 2 year old by myself, and living with my parents so my idea of security was much different.  I don't think that I could see beyond financial security at the time, and I thought that once I achieved a certain financial goal or position, that I would be secure.  This is not the case because when I reached all those milestones of ""financial security"", I still needed ""more"".  What shifted my priorities was realizing that things in life will happen that we don't want or don't expect, and we can either go with the flow and accept them and find a solution, or fight them and live in misery.  Once I realized that I was never going to reach a point in life where ""bad"" things (or negative situations) stopped happening, I was able to accept things in life as they came.  This was a HUGE turning point to my security.  I no longer needed things or money to feel secure.  I began doing what I could to prepare for the future so that I wasn't so afraid (started an IRA, contributed what I could to a 401k, started paying off things so I didn't feel so overwhelmed).  Now I feel like I am at a secure place in my financial as well as spiritual and mental areas of my life. Definitely my health.  I found out that I have some genetic mutations that make cancer much more likely, and I have been dealing with accepting this and not fearing the future.  Obviously this has had a huge impact on my peace and hope for the future, but I am working on accepting me for who I am and not living in fear. Probably God because I don't know what my plan is for the future, and I can never know that.  So it's always hard to live in faith and not fear the future. I think that in order for this to change, I need to continue doing what I've been doing these past few weeks:
1. Daily positive affirmations
2. Stay focused on today and not worry about what could or might happen
3. Remember all the things that have happened in my past that show me that I have a God that is taking care of me. 
4. Stay positive and remember all the things I have to be grateful for. I would definitely agree with this.  An end goal assumes that you reach a point where you are always secure, and that it remains that way.  However, life happens, things change, we lose and gain things, so our feeling of security can change with these events.  However, if you reach a state of feeling secure mentally, then regardless of what life throws at you, you can keep your sense of security in knowing that things will work out, regardless of what you face. This is a tough question because I have so many times in my life where I felt insecure for many reasons.  However, one time that I remember vividly is when I graduated college and bought our first home.  I was the only one working out of a family of 3.  My husband was out of work at the time and I was so scared about bills and financial security because almost every cent I made went to supporting our home.  I would clip every coupon I could, go to multiple grocery stores to get the best sales on food just to stay within budget.  We had no savings and no retirement.  We had a lot of credit card bills, and I just felt like we were drowning.  I felt so insecure that I used that as strength to change.  We stayed within budget and slowly paid off our debt.  I started contributing just small amounts to my 401k and opened an IRA that I contributed small amounts to as well.  My husband got a job, and we ended up selling our house and moving to a nicer home.  We made a profit off the house and we used that money to pay off credit card debt.  Since then, I have worked diligently to become financially secure.  I had a few tough times since then, but NOTHING like what I went through then.  I never let credit card debt get out of hand, I keep a savings at all times (no matter how big or small), and have increased my contributions to retirement as I get raises.  Looking back, there wasn't much I could have done then to prevent that situation, seeing as I was just starting out.  I guess not getting so much credit card debt while in college is really the big thing. Initially, I think that security should be independent of others.  If you depend on others for your security, where will you be if something happens to them?  However, I feel that as a child or young adult, a lot of your security can depend upon your parents and family.  However, I would relate this shared security to a marriage, where both members essentially depend upon each other for something (whether financial or otherwise).  I know that I rely on my husband financially to pay the bills, however, I could still survive without him, just not as comfortably. Financial security to me includes the following:
1. Having an income greater than your required expenses
2. Having a savings 
3. Having life insurance
4. Having a retirement savings of some sort (IRA, 401k, etc) beyond social security
5. Being responsible with your spending I would feel more financially secure if our bills were a little lower.  I have the money in savings to pay a lot off, but I'm just not ready to let go of that much liquid assets!  I'd rather keep it in savings and earn interest, then pay the bills off if we absolutely have to (most are 0% anyway so I'm not losing money, just have more money going out per month). I got the impression that principal offers a variety of financial products.  Nothing really put me off.  The retirement calculator was one thing that interested me.",Boston,
322906,Kit,Tsoi,kt.kitsoi@gmail.com,"I'd choose Neal's Yard Remedies from the UK which is quite a well-known organic aromatherapy and skincare brand worldwide. The reason that I chose this brand is because I appreciate their value and how they insist their core value of organic and sustainability in the source of ingredients, product production and the way they share the message to the world, they'd share how they source the ingredients and the story of those villages or farm. I also love their holistic approach of the product range and concept which highly tied with the professions of aromatherapy, which they would educate customer how to apply in daily life to improve their health and well-being. I appreciate this brand in the way that it stand for it's value of organic and natural products, at the same time the value integrates with its business operation and marketing campaigns. 

I have worked as its Assistant Brand Manager for Hong Kong & Macau market before, I'd say I'm proud of having the chance to represent this brand. After working in skincare industry for a long time, I have seen many different personal care brands, many of the brands established for earning money only without soul. This is the first brand that I can see their value and feel their history and soul, even the staff worked there have lots of aromatherapists and people who loves nature and holistic lifestyle, it is not only a brand and an enterprise, its a huge community with like minded people to share the value of green & organic, from the headquarter in the UK to different distributors all over the world to the customers who use the products. I can still remember when I joined their annual conference years before, I meet different distributors all over the world and we share what the projects we do like therapy projects, education and campaign to promote the therapeutic product and service to help the customers and our own society. 

We need more brand like this in the world, especially now. I would see feeling secure as a process, it's a process of healing, recovery and establishing inner strength like what I have went through. It's not something about logics, analysis or fact, it's more about intuition, feeling and imagination which is the scope of right brain, therefore I'd like to illustrated by a story of the little turtle. 

We can start the story from the left. Long long time ago, there is a little turtle who lost its family, the turtle is feeling weak and lonely, he is full of negativity like surrounding by dark clouds. When the environment is dark or not familiar to him, he would be very sensitive, feeling unsecured, having bad feeling, then want to run away. As time goes by he has grown up, start recognizing and accepting his sensitivity, he slowly build his confidence and strength. In this stage, the key elements for feeling secure is: 1. Self-Awareness; 2. Self-recognization; 3. Self-acceptance; 4. Building security and strength. Usually they come in step by step, they're all very important elements.

One day, little turtle is ready to leave his past behind, he sees different warm and kind friends and communities who are supporting him. He restores his own rainbow, having more growth in his chakra, his energy shines like a rainbow. He has more security, willpower, creativity, feeling loved, being more expressive and feeling more connected with his inspiration and his friends. He now has the energy and power to swim away from negativity and go towards other species that has healthy rainbow like him. He can travel and explore around the world by his own hands. 

In this stage, the element for feeling secured is connection. Before having connection with others, we shall have connection with our own self. That's why it shall start from the previous stage about self acceptance. Once we restored the connection with own self, we have more objective understanding of own self, we are able to have real connection with others. Real connection means deep connection with hear to heart conversation, it means like minded people who shares similar value, it feels like home to be surrounded by those people.

I know this exercise would like me to name those elements that made me feel secured but I found that after I restoring my own strength, not much things can make me feel unsecured anymore. I feel safe, I feel secured and at home where I go to because I'm a secured person. So the healing process or the process building strength is the real element that matter. Once you can go inward instead of seeking security outside, you are healed. 10 years before when I was 28, I had a stable long distance relationship and full time job. I live like many of the office ladies and just finished my part time master degree. Exactly that year, I decided to moved to Belgium to stay with my boyfriend and look for career opportunity there. I have many nice pictures of my future since life seems easier with more freedom and possibility in Europe. At that time, what I wanted was staying with my boyfriend, have a stable job and perhaps enjoy life in Europe, that's my life priority as well as the factors keep me feeling secured and satisfied, I thought. 

Nevertheless, according to Murphy's law, ""anything that can go wrong will go wrong"". My boyfriend and me haven't moved to English speaking countries as planned, we stayed in Belgium and I studied French, the unexpected change made me feeling stuck which affected my mental health but I tried to keep everything normal and the same. After a year, I returned to Hong Kong by myself. The next year, my boyfriend moved to Hong Kong. Since then, my life priority still haven't changed for years until I had certain emotional breakdown around 2015 with the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. My boyfriend and I then broke up in 2016, my life direction and priority changed dramatically since then.

I started my healing and recovery journey, start putting focus on discovering and understanding myself. I didn't schedule having lunch and dinner with my parents every Sunday, I didn't need to plan what to do every Saturday with my boyfriend, suddenly I have more time and freedom for myself. I didn't get used to it in the beginning, I was feeling quite lonely to live by myself and having nearly every meal by myself. After few years, I get used to stay with myself even though I still want to have a person next to me to support and share with.

In 2017, I made another big decision to quit my full time job for creating my own dream life. It was a big step for my self actualization, I felt like this is the time and I felt secured at the same time a bit unsecured to do that, kind of like ""now or never"" moment. With the experience in the past 3 years, I am so happy that I made that decision, now I created my own dream job which is being a nomad slash and found out that this is bigger than a career, it's a new type of lifestyle or new way of living that I enjoy a lot. I would like to share this new lifestyle with others too. Security factor or life priority is not a pyramid to me anymore, it's more like a circle or in radiance. By focusing on myself or you can call it self love, I have the energy to extend myself and share with others like my family and friends even to the society and the world. I enjoy my life so much at this stage, I feel secured and satisfied even with the unknown situation of the future. I enjoy slowing down and staying at my own city during the covid-19, I can always discover new things in life no matter where I am, I can spend more time with my family and friends too.

While every time when I am satisfied with the current stage, the universe would like to push me forward to the next stage. My next stage would be sharing my new lifestyle to the mass. Perhaps the lifestyle of digital nomad is getting popular in the western countries but not yet to Asian counties, however, covid-19 caused a shift of lifestyle of the whole world also pushed it forward. It is a good timing to share the idea of nomad and slash life, so I'm preparing myself for writing column, publishing a book or healing card and being a podcaster for that. It needs me further expand my security, the security towards media and the public, I still have some struggles sometimes but I'm getting ready for it.

Well, when you face every new challenge and new expansion, it's normal to have fear and insecurity. I think now I learned from my previous growth therefore it won't scared me that much anymore. That would be the element that have been neglected and putting as lower priority in the past few years, which is relationship. I'm perfectly okay to live alone and get used to my single life now but the lifestyle can be so different after having a partner. At that time, I can't only care about myself, I might, probably would care about and cover my partner too, so lots of adjustment in life would need to be make, there would be learning curve too. It would be a big change which means insecurity and uncertainty.

I can't do everything for something that haven't happened, I can only have my mind and heart ready for adjustment and being opened to changes since I still have hope for finding my Mr. Right. I always remind myself to ""Trust, have faith"", remember all is well. 

And thanks for the question, it's probably time to get myself ready for that : ) I agree that feeling secure is a state of mind but not sure if I would call it as end goal.

Feeling secure definitely affects a person's mood, if a person wants to have good mood, the sense of security would be a fundamental requirement. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, security belongs to safety needs which is the basic needs of human being, therefore feeling secure is a very common and basic condition for a person who wants to live a happy and peaceful life.

I can imagine some people who are desperately looking for security or who suffer from mental issue might see feeling secure as an end goal. Those people probably feel so much insecurity inside, they might feel ""lack"" and ""not enough"" which made them to seek security, usually from outside factors like partner, family, even career. It's kind of like they can't help themselves and can't stand straight by themselves, that's why would need somebody else to lift them up and it's always the reason for a codependent relationship. Nobody can fully satisfy another person and fill another person's heart. 

If a person see feeling secure as an end goal, the person probably can't achieve the 'goal'. You can't get something that you think you don't have or don't deserve to have. For example, if a person says that feeling safe or feeling full is his end goal, you might probably feel pity for that person because it means that the person is in poverty since his basic needs can't be fulfilled. If a person says that feeling secure is his end goal, I'd say the person is in mental poverty then. Feeling secure can be an end goal especially to people who are in mental poverty.

For people like us who lives in developed countries, most of our basic needs can be fulfilled with the safety net and welfare system of our countries. So our end goal would be more about psychological and self-fulfillment needs. Of course there are exceptional cases, for example, when we are facing crisis and diseases, COVID-19 would be a typical case. It shocked the world and shaken many of our belief system, I believe many of the people would see feeling secure as goal and necessity during the outbreak.

There's also cases that people are willing to sacrifice or give up the feeling of security in short term for something they want to achieve or bigger than them in long term. The protest of Hong Kong in 2019 is quite an extreme cases to elaborate. I believe the people who joined the protest are not feeling secure during the protest but they still try to fight for the freedom to exchange for security in long term. To some of the people, fight for the freedom and defending their homeland itself already can calm their mind since they're doing something right for themselves, for their people and their own place. The power of protecting their place outreach the basic needs they suppose need. The utmost case would be the persons who chose to committed suicide in order to change the government and the people's mind. I believe for those people, feeling secure can be their state of mind while security won't be their end goal, instead, their goal is the well-being of their homeland. It was in mid-Jun 2019, we had another big march in Hong Kong with more than a million people to join. I also joined the march with 2 of more friends, we are quite familiar with the route since it's not our first time to join such march. However, this time was quite different to me, it's the first time I can't find the whole route. Since that day got too many people on the street, it took much longer time to move than usual but people are still being patient and calm. Until late afternoon, when the sky was getting darker, the atmosphere of the march was different...

a. The painting is the moment when we arrived a basketball stadium on the street, some of the people are resting there and many of the family and kids are leaving the march, it's already 4 hours after the march started. I felt that the atmosphere of the march is getting heavier, with all the people occupy the streets, protestors are having high moods. Some of the young people shout to the police and insulted them, people keep shouting with the slogan. 

As an emotionally sensitive person, I felt so much fear with strong and heavy emotion at that moment. My heart was feeling hurt and unsecured, I was so scared something bad would be happening. I told my friends I was not feeling well, I can't go on the march anymore. I decided to leave the team, a friend decided to leave with me and the other went on the protest. I have no way to 'overcome' the fear and prevent bad things to happen, what I can do is keep myself in good condition. So leaving the march team is my only choice.

b. I would still handle the same way because respecting and accepting my emotion is essential, even though I want to finish and show my discontent deeply. 

c. Since then, I still joined some big marches and those protest I know that is rather safe. One of the reasons is my safety shall be the priority if I want to do something meaningful for myself and the society in the future; second, I was not resonated with the hatred. I do want to show my discontent and support those who fight back but I don't want to create hatred and fear anymore. I believe 2019 was a journey of a big self discovery and awakening of the Hong Kong people and the city, I can see the spiritual meaning behind the incidents, the needs of burn and reborn, even though we don't want any lives to lost for that. 1. Yes security can be shared, if I change the word 'security' into another word, you might find it even more reasonable. ""Shared love"" and ""feeling love can be shared"". Security is an important part of love therefore it makes sense.

2. I think the idea of shared security always happened in my life especially when I'm dealing with people, including family, friends and relationship. Just I got higher consciousness for how it affects me and the people surround me in the past few years. Many of my friends were getting lost in their life direction in the past few years, I'd go hang out with them, chat with them, have nice food together and told them how things are going well. And I am so happy that they'd feel relieved, relaxed, even got more clarity after we met. By experiencing how to keep my own security thru ups and downs, I feel at ease to most of the difficult situation, then I share such peace and carefreeness to my friends, it affected their perspective and mood too.

I used to be affected by people surround me a lot, my parents and partner are key to shape my security. I'd look for them and want to gain recognition from them before, their preference affected my career and life direction a lot. But now I built my individuality and boundary with others, my security doesn't shape by others anymore, instead I have a deep knowing of myself, embracing my shadow and appreciating my bright side became the real source of my security. t  tt t tttt tt ttt t t t t t tt t t t t t t t I'm planning to apply for a loan for SME in order to support my living but I have delayed the application for half month already. It is because I feel like I don't need that, I have good feeling that income will come to me effortlessly. 

I am a bit struggled if I shall trust my intuition or follow the rational mind. Every time when I trust my intuition to let go of control, good news would come in and the problem I concerned would be solved automatically, it always happened like this in the past few years after I quit my full time job.

So I see it as the ultimate test to test my trust and faith. Classic, financial style, institutional.

My impression is its another classical financial institution.

373147,Jennifer,Tsitsopoulos,jennifer.shab@gmail.com,"Respect is something that needs to be earned, not just once - but continuously. It's never simply given, but must be proven time and time again. 

Brands I 'respect' must meet the following criteria:
- They have the wisdom and expertise in a given field or knowledge-area
- They have overcome hardships and built up experience in their industry
- They have clear values (even if they aren't the same as mind) and stay true to these values / their word

The obvious example Nike for the stance they take on cultural and social reforms. But let's go with something a little less on the beaten path for the activity.

Gucci is a brand I respect, but oddly enough - I don't happen to own anything from them. So why do I respect them?

1. I am impressed with their ability to remain fresh and relevant through the ages, even as consumer tastes and internal leadership changes.
2. I admire the confidence they place in themselves. They are one of the only brands that never goes on sale, anywhere.
3. I appreciate the fact that they acknowledge their previous errors and flaws. No brand (or human) is perfect. It's pointless to pretend otherwise. Gucci, like other fashion brands, have received backlash in the past for stealing styles off of small streetwear designers, like Dapper Dan. Instead of denying it, the brand eventually brought Dapper Dan into the fold and featured him in collaborations and advertising. 
4. I am obsessed with the fact that they continue to realize their own weakness and align their mission to their values. A few year back they launched Equilibrium (equilibrium.gucci.com) a platform that transparently shares their sustainability goals and more importantly, how they are tracking in progress against them. When I think about the aspects of feeling secure, I think of balancing different parts of my life that are core to being fulfilled. To represent this, I chose to base my visual off of the ‘Wheel of Life’ which is a life coaching tool inspired by Tibetan wisdom. To use the tool, you start in the middle (0) and score yourself on the lines in each piece of the pie for your happiness level. I believe you can apply this same thinking to feelings of security. “How stable do you feel in each aspect of your life”?

However unlike the traditional Wheel of Life, my version has been designed around three foundations to modern happiness - health, wealth, love. Within each, I have created 2 sub-categories. These are meant to capture the core aspects of life that are fundamental to feeling secure. Whoever uses the matrix has the ability to interpret them based on their needs. Additionally, in my version I wanted to capture feeling secure in both the current state (the center) as well as future concerns (out in the perimeter).  I find thinking about the future can be just as threatening to my security as my current situation.

The areas of most importance are based on where you are over and under-indexing at any point in your life — as well as the intrinsic motivators that matter most to you. It’s impossible to be fully balanced and always operating a complete security in all aspects of life, so if you’re feeling stable in your career and marriage, then maybe you are feeling unbalanced or insecure in your financial situation. In school you’re taught about security through the lens of basic needs stemming back to our mammal instincts. Maslow’s pyramid is probably the most common visualization of the importance of security, showcasing it close to the base of the pyramid. 

I once had an interesting conversation with the colleague on how this pyramid has almost been reversed or flipped on its head in current times where we place a premium on mental wellness and self-fulfillment, while at times ignoring or forgetting things like rest and safety.

In the past decade, I have sought out more security and safety. I suppose the idea of safety in my youth was simply not as appealing or valued to me as the desire for fun, exploration and experience. I traveled and worked in Australia, living out of a suitcase for three years and having the time of my life. But as the pressure to be an adult (driven by peers, family and society) grew, so did the need to begin laying the foundations for family and even my retirement, and therefore I began to seek out a more stable life for myself.

In recent months, my idea of security has shifted even more. I realize that even my definitions and reflections of security are clouded by my privilege as an educated white female who has the time and flexibility to respond to these sort of questions. The protests have shined a light on just how lucky I am to be thinking about feeling secure in this way. I imagine that I am slightly less negative or worried about feeling secure in areas of my life and career. Now I find myself being thankful to have a job, roof over my head, a supportive partner, and food on the table. The crisis of course. It’s impacting (almost) all of the elements of my framework. I’m concerned for my health (mental and physical), wealth (my job), and I am worried about friends and family. The pandemic is something new, something that even leading scientists can’t quite grasp - and until we have a vaccine, I believe I will continue to have a level of acute insecurity around me.

The crisis has also changed the way I look at my long term future. Will I still need to live and work in a city? Will all this single-serving plastic use be the downfall of the environment? Is it safe to raise kids when this virus is running rampant? I believe the biggest hurdle to feeling secure is fear in the unknown. The unknown threatens our ability to feel stable in each of the aspects of our life. But the unknown will always be a threat and it is why many people seek familiarity and routine behaviors. 

In the current, I feel most insecure around wealth (finances and career). The industry I work in has been greatly impacted by the crisis, and the clients I do business with are being disrupted as well. Add to that the fact that the US has entered into a recession and more unknowns enter into the equation. 

Once a vaccine arrives much of this fear will reside, replaced by some new threat. In essence I don't believe this feeling of insecurity ever truly goes away. Instead, I believe one can work to manage it. Management of insecurity is all about taking actions to safeguard yourself from one's own fears of the unknown. 

In my situation, insecurity around my finances and career (induced by the crisis), are managed by re-budgeting of household expenses and the thinking through of fall-back roles and careers. I would disagree with this.

Reflecting back on the framework I developed, there is a future aspect to feeling secure. I would argue that part of our basic instincts as humans, stemming back from early man, is to find security. That it has always been an end-goal for us. Achieving a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy yourself in anyway you so choose, is dependent on the feeling of safety and security. Without it, we will always have worries that get in the way of true fulfillment. 

Now you could argue that feeling secure is a state of mind. I do believe that the mind is a powerful thing and that believing something to be true can greatly increase its likeliness too manifest. That said, security is not always something you can control and therefore simply believing you are secure can ultimately lead to disastrous outcomes. As humans we greatly want to believe we are secure, we tell ourselves that certain behaviors don't matter (like a plastic straw with daily cup of coffee) and that if others say somethings okay it is (like returning to bars during the pandemic), but does that remove the threat that caused our fears of insecurity in the first place? Have you ever felt like an imposter? Imposter syndrome refers to an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be. It occurs during new and uncomfortable situations, whether that be social or your career. Picture this, entering into a new company in a new career - one in which you already feel is a stretch for your skills. When I made the switch from Advertising to Innovation, there was so much jargon to learn that I constantly felt like a fraud trying to keep up. I threw myself headfirst into learning as much as I could about my new role - in and out of work. I read books, took courses, and drowned myself in all the latest blogs and articles on the world of innovation. Looking back, I realize no one was pressuring me to become a master in this space. This was pressure I was placing on myself. They hired me for the role for a reason and if done differently, I would have embraced the skills that made me unique and use my difference in expertise to challenge my company in new ways. Of course this feeling has happened since, anytime I take on a completely new challenge or stretch myself too fast. I believe the best way to battle imposter syndrome is time and preparation, but lets face it - thats not always a possibility. For sure. I think societal or shared security is definitely a concept that rings true. Although I think of it less as a reciprocal two way street and more of a support system. A system in which every action causes a reaction and its that interlocking of societies that makes us all interdependent on one another. This shared security can often take on a bad turn when individuals with shared ethnicities, beliefs, features or other, begin to feel their security shaken. That’s where cultures turn on one another and turn against those unlike their own.   On a smaller, more personal level, I tend to find that when I am insecure I can radiate that insecurity onto others. You could say that insecurity is contagious. The same can be said for those around me. The more confident others are in our situation, the more I in turn feel confident. Having enough savings to cover basic living expenses for you and your loved ones in the current and future tense. Your household income must be greater than your spending. A budget that helps us to plan for retirement. It would take alot of unknowns out of the equation for us to monitor the ins and outs of our finances. At least for me, I’v always depended on someone else to do my finances - my husband, my father. It seems overwhelming, complicated, and a complete nuisance to have to dig up all the required information for this said budget - not to mention the upkeep once its complete. Writing up a budget always seems like a job for tomorrow, never today. Three words: Robo financial advisor.

First impression: Sounds like an interesting premise, not really sure what any of it means to me (for example, what does this really mean? “Digital investing with a human connection”). Can I trust an algorithm with my future? 

What put me off: Was really hard to figure out what exactly Principal does. I believe I had to click a few links to realize it was a robo advisor (not sure what that is still) and an algorithm. There was so much copy on the first page that I was lost and overwhelmed by what the value proposition was. For a ‘disruptive idea’ the site feels very much traditional.

Interest was peaked: I think there is something really exciting about using the power of data and my own personal goals to take the guess work out of financial planning. Although it sounds too good to be true. Why aren’t the traditional firms doing this?",Boston,
356698,Jacqui ,Sizeland,jacquisizeland@gmail.com,"A brand I respect for what they stand for and what they are doing it St Johns Ambulance. I have chosen St Johns Ambulance as I believe over their long life and the various crises and world changes they have weathered, they have done a great job at holding to their core mission of making sure first aid is available for everyone. They have long been a reassuring presence at events and in communities, a feeling that was cemented for me when my partner received their services to recover from severe exhaustion in a marathon event. This image shows the importance of the support of others as the core of my feeling secure. The protection and support from my family, friends and partner provide a key part of my emotional, physical and fiscal security. Security is not something I can construct on my own and that is why an embrace, an human interaction is at the heart of my security. This gives me the relaxed, calm feeling required as a foundation of life.

This embrace and the layers surrounding the heart of my image is also more than just a physical person. All the layers represent all the different layers of security I have built for myself. They are cocooning and protecting the core and creating the security I crave. The people are protecting from the elements and held at the core of the world they have constructed for themselves by the layers. These layers represent my education, work experience, friendships, adventures, resources and attitude built up over my life time to give me security. 

Finally the outside of the image shows the earth, the mountains, the seas and the trees. Something important for security of all of the people and something that seems increasingly insecure. The beautiful places in the world give me a feeling of security a they show that nature still has a place and is surviving and allow me to peel back the layers of life and reflect on what is important, leading to a greater personal sense of security. My diagram would have been very different 10 years ago. It would not have had a person cocooned in the middle but would have had a world breaking apart and starting to be formed. There would have been just one layer surrounding that secure center and the atmosphere would have been filled with strange weather. 

10 year ago, I was setting off to university, leaving behind my family and home, and breaking or changing relationships that had looked after me my whole life. I had little idea of what the future held and was concerned that there was no clear path for me to work towards. My emotional support system was changing as was my financial one. I was truly in charge of my own budget, food, shelter and future for the first time. I found it hard to understand which layers of security I could take with me and which ones I needed to build new.

Working alongside studying was important to me, in order to keep my debt levels manageable. Changing houses every year, changing degrees, changing friends and working 3 different jobs introduced constant change to my life. I had to evolve or fail. I had no permanent living place, moving between my home town and university town every summer. Obtaining a degree that would allow me to pay back my student loan quickly (ish) and live comfortably was very important. I had little idea of what careers were out there aside from doctors or teachers, and each step took me towards the unknown, as I tried to figure out how to lay the foundations for my career and lifestyle. My mindset towards being secure focused on minimizing bad outcomes and finding a direction which would one day allow me to lay a secure foundation. Security was a focus that I dedicated every day to and not yet a platform that I could build from. Like a video game character at a low level, I knew that there were a lot of obstacles coming and I had just enough skills and health to get past them, so long as I did not make any false moves. Security was a fine balance. 

A significant turning point for me was deciding to pursue a BComm instead of a BA and deciding to undertake an Honours study year after my 3 year degree, both to improve my employ-ability and expand my network. This shifted my priorities towards building a career in business and gave me a strong direction to follow. Another turning point was being accepted to a graduate programme. This significantly shifted my priorities as it gave me a stable income and allowed me to explore different career paths at the same time. The freedom I obtained from this graduate programme altered my mindset and course in life. It demonstrated to me that I now had the skills and experience to move my career in any direction I wanted, and allowed me the freedom to do this. Several relationship changes over these 10 years also helped me to understand the importance of protecting and looking after myself and prioritizing my career, to ensure I had my own layer of security that I could take to any relationship and then walk away with. 

In more recent times the levels of security I have built up have been tested, yet I am am still much more secure than I was at university. My layers of security have given me a lot of freedom, even though I have found myself searching for a job in an unprecedented period of economic downturn and increasing unemployment. I know I have the skills, financial reserves, relationships and emotional maturity to find my career path again and continue to build my expertise. Currently I have been working as a contractor. I have had a number of different roles however, this is the first time I have not been in full time permanent work since university. This leaves me feeling uncertain about the country I live in, field I have chosen to pursue a career in. It has made me think more deeply about how I might be able to build on my skills and networks in the city I have just moved to, and if there are any other career paths I would like to take the opportunity to try out. The lack of immediate job security has impacted my life by presenting a cross roads with many new opportunities to weigh up, consider and potentially pursue. One of the elements in my diagram I feel the most insecure about is the world around the cocooned figures. I am concerned about how significant changes in the world might impact this. In order for me to feel more secure about the world I would need to get better at managing my finances across exchange rates, see some more political stability and witness a large change in how we are currently tackling climate change. I also feel insecure about the relationships in the middle. I am distanced from the family that underpin my security and not sure when I will see them again. This makes me feel insecure about where I am living and my ability to change directions and move home ASAP if needed. I would agree that security is a state of mind, but I do not think this stops it from being an end goal. Achieving a secure state of mind is something I have been able to achieve by building up different layers of emotional resilience, strong relationships and physical resources. Security is not a purely mental or physical state and has required me to strengthen and build many different pillars of my life. All these things have led me to achieve a secure state of mind. 

I think security is bigger than owning a house or having a retirement fund. It includes everything from building my personal value through improving my skills and employ-ability, to building the value of my relationships and even improving my ability to react to change by being physically and emotionally fit. Assets can be taken away through a variety of different life events which is what makes intangible assets such as skills and relationships even more important to me, as well as diversifying my physical assets. Security for me is also about understanding what is coming up and mentally preparing for it. I cannot have a secure state of mind without having a strong grasp on what could impact my world and some ideas on how I might react to it. A time when I felt insecure was when considering whether or not I should accept a job offer in Dubai. I was really unsure whether or not I should take the role, not knowing what would be best for my career, my finances and my relationship. The indecision left me feeling insecure and not confident that I was making the best life choices. I felt like I was not set up to take hold of the different opportunities life presented. 

I overcame this by considering the offer carefully and talking to several mentors and colleagues about how to assess the right path. One of my mentors suggested I should not go for something new just because it was offered, and I should make sure I first extracted all the learning and nuggets of wisdom from my current role. Another mentor suggested it was important to not only consider the loudest / most obvious opportunities but also what other opportunities where out there that I could apply for. These pieces of advice, alongside the financial and cultural considerations and my relationships with family, friends and my partner led me to remain in New Zealand and not accept the offer. 

If I had gone through the same situation, I might have worked harder to understand how I could have the best of both worlds and take the opportunity for a limited time e.g. a 6 month secondment so that I could gain experience of working in Dubai with a different team and culture, as well as maintaining the emotional, physical and financial security of my permanent job in New Zealand. I like this idea and I think security is definitely something I construct with others around me, both emotional and financial security. I think at the moment I am in a phase in my life where I am more likely to receive assistance building my security rather than give it out, however, I expect this to change if I have children and possibly as my partners parents and my parents age. 

My understanding of security and the way I pursue it was built by my parents and my upbringing. Independence, equality, generosity and hard work were all values my parents stressed the importance of. This led to myself and my siblings always evaluating the cost and payback of different study routes and career paths and looking ahead to how we would pay off student debts and how we would build security in our own lives. I think both my parents working in the medical profession, a generally respected and secure profession, led to me really critically evaluating different career paths and working hard to make sure that when I choose a less directly vocational route, I would still be able to secure I good job and long term career.

We were always taught the importance of saving and being frugal and were expected to earn and manage our own incomes to support our study and life after. However, we always had the assurance that if we met with any obstacles, mum and dad would provide extra support. For example one of my siblings studied overseas on a scholarship but needed some extra support as it was hard to hold down a job during term time alongside a lot of sport commitments. I know they appreciate this security my parents were able to provide but at the same time they are very excited to pay my parents back one day as being able to look after yourself is a strong family value.

When at University I had a long term partner move down to be closer to me and I provided them with greater security by providing accommodation, food and financial support whilst he found a job and friends. And now, I have had the good fortune to have a partner with a secure job when moving to a new city, allowing me greater freedom to spend time finding a job I am truly interested in. I am sure one day I will be responsible for even more peoples security, and thinking about that makes me more nervous about my recent life choices which have led to my casual employment at the moment. I need to make the most of the flexibility I currently have due to being more a recipient of security boosts than a giver of extra security but it is hard to truly embrace this and still prepare for a future where I will need to provide more security boosts than I receive. Financial security means to me the ability to support myself with good quality food and shelter, the ability to continue to do so in the event of obstacles (e.g. periods of unemployment, unexpected financial losses etc.), the ability to cover unexpected financial outlays for medical or other reasons, the ability to provide security to my closest friends, my family and partner and finally the ability to travel and eat out and buy the occasional item like a bike. Taking a job now, putting it off as I want the right job not any job. They seem to be actually providing information to help and it seems to be more focused on the product then on setting up an account for you straight away which is nice. I like the brand video and would be more likely to try and find a product for myself and to stay at principal for a while after seeing that. 

Something that put me off is that there is only ""for you and your family"" and ""for your business"" - I guess I fall into the first bucket but as I am currently just working on trying to support myself it doesn't particularly speak to me as it makes me think it is just for people with children who need to get income and life insurance and those are not products that I believe I need right now? The ask for feedback came up to soon - I have not even clicked off the homepage so I do not have enough of a relationship with Principal to bother spending 5 minutes giving them feedback on the website. Maybe if the CTA about finding a financial professional focused more on what I needed I would have clicked it? Like if it focused on budgeting planning retirement etc... All the other CTAs up top do seem to be focused around current customers as is most of the website - great to see that current customers get ongoing information but hard to see how a new customer would fit in. 

When I clicked through to the individual section the information felt very generic, more sales focused and the whole area of the site did not look as slick. For example ""Digital investing with a human connection"" still did not really speak to me but if it had been more about setting up an account within half an hour with a low management fee and that would give me a better return rate than my term deposit then something like that would have been attractive. I liked the content when I clicked through better especially the example people investment profiles as they let me see myself using this tool and really brought to life that it is something I could be looking into. It would have been good to see one of them not saving for retirement maybe something like get on to the property ladder or something. The acronym IRA was really off putting as I don't know what it means and it made me feel like I future information might be overly complicated or have lots of abbreviations. It would have been great to have more information upfront about what would be needed to start the account to show if it is simple or complicated.",Boston,
373146,Holly,Mensch,holly.mensch@gmail.com,"I love Danone right now. 
Danone is a large international company.  Big companies, especially if they are global, tend to be slow and get hung up in bureaucracy.  This is why they are so slow to react to consumer trends. It is why, in the food industry, small brands are eating their lunch. The small brands are stepping up launching products that deliver against the health of people and the health of the planet- it is what people are looking for. People want companies to step up and think holistically. 

Danone has signed up to be a B-Corp and is implementing this worldwide. To be a B-Corp, you need to think about the environment, your surrounding community, and your employees and not just the financial stakeholders. Small companies and brands think like this today, big ones….not so much. 
When you sign up to be a B-Corp, you get evaluated by an independent outside, objective party, and you get graded, and you get ranked. It is fully transparent how you are doing. Danone has earned my respect because they are large and have stepped up to the plate to say that they are doing this, AND, better yet, they are actually executing against it! Bravo! The bucket represents the number of financial resources that are available and needed to feel secure. 
If the bucket is full and overflowing, this is great and represents high security. If empty or worse yet, draining due to a hole (no money coming in but bills going out, there is no feeling of security. 

The Levels within the bucket represent the linear view of how the bucket is used and viewed. The bottom layer is the MUST Haves - the money needed just to pay the bills to live today. Since at the bottom, the $ is scarcer, they are the most important. If you can't pay and survive today, does it really matter about retirement? Ditto for the next level up. Finally, the level that involves being sick is not as important just now. It may be our age, our current good health, or the fact that we may be able to pull from the retirement to fund that...but I do believe over the next decade, that may become more important vs. this illustration. I think there would have probably only been two levels: 1) Paying the everyday bills and 2) retirement. Paying the everyday bills was hugely important. 
I carried two jobs in order to eat, pay off my school loans and car payment, and have money to have fun in my 20s! 

Retirement was only considered when I was working for a company that did a matching program.  My parents said that it was free money, so you had to do it! SO I did it. I always contributed enough to get the match at 100%.  I didn't think about it in terms of quality of life in retirement. I thought about it as free income I couldn't touch. 

My mindset for felling secure has changed. I opted out of staying on with a company post-acquisition and had to look for another job - instant lack of security. I am seeing my parents and my husband's parents start to have health issues that is beginning to worry us about our ability to not fund for retirement but to fund for untold medical expenses like memory care or health care. 

We are watching our money better and pushing more into retirement / old age savings than just the minimum. I am currently looking for a new job, and unemployment is extremely high, and if COVID-19 waves keep coming, this will likely increase. There are not that many senior jobs in the marketplace, so my pool of jobs is small to begin with. Therefore I am concerned that it will be months or at least until after COVID until I can find a new job. I am the primary breadwinner so my job usually pays for all our bills and provides health care. 
For now, we are simply watching our money and being on top of it more than before and no incremental spending beyond just day to day expenses. I feel the most insecure right now about having to tap into retirement savings in order to pay the bills. Between our savings and our slush fund for emergencies, we are fine, but if I am out of work for a long time, it will impact the retirement savings that we don't ever touch. 

At some point, if I don't get a position at a company that is similar to what I should get, I will get a job that is at a lower level (probably doing something new), that I want to do that also has health care. I don’t think it is either, or perhaps it is something in between. State of mind implies always on and a base comfort level to me but not really a sense of urgency or a number associated with it. End goal to me implies a one-time event with a high level of urgency with a number associated with it. I think security is an always-on event that does have a sense of urgency and a number associated with it.  You are always building to that number over time. I think this moment that we are in right now is probably the moment I felt most insecure. My position was eliminated, along with most of my peers at the company where I was working. 

I have lived through corporate mergers and other restructuring events where there was clearly some unease. In these situations, while I wasn’t in 100% control, I knew it was coming and that I would be out of a job. In these cases, I felt confident that I would be fine and land a job reasonably shortly after these events. My background, performance, sponsors, and a good economy gave me confidence.  And, in every case, I did land a job – usually, ones that were better than the one I had! It didn’t scare me; it just made for the typical angst of getting a new job, interviewing, onboarding, and proving your worth. And there was also the pain of having to uproot and move if the job required it. 

This is wildly different. 1. The jobs outlook does not look good and may not bounce back until a vaccine is developed and most of the population is vaccinated. 2. There appears to be movement to retire people with experience (looking at all the postings on LinkedIn) 3. Companies appear to be promoting younger people with less experience vs. hiring from the outside. 4. All these older displaced people seem to now be moving into consulting or coaching so that area is a crowded place. None of this fares well for someone with lots of experience. I feel like one of the workers that George Clooney talks to in the movie “Up the Air”. 

I haven’t yet overcome this. I am networking and contemplating opening a consulting practice and exploring side gigs. I would rather have a full time position with a team – I like being around people and getting to the job of running a business. That is what I do and when I am happiest and feel most secure. Shared security does exist. I think the burden that people put on themselves to provide a secure environment is actually driven and more pronounced because of the others around you. Honestly, I could be fine with less, but as the primary breadwinner, I need to provide the roof over our heads, the cars we drive, our insurance, our food, and every other thing that takes money. It is not something my husband asks for or demands, but there is this underlying sense of responsibility to ensure that I have a job so I can provide a good life or both of us for today through to our last days. 

We are already chatting about alternatives if the economy doesn’t come back, and I don’t get a job. Overall, it is not having to worry that I will never get stuck not being able to provide for myself and my family - in good times and bad. 
This goes back to the picture I drew in a previous exercise. 
Level one - Ability to pay the day to day living expenses
Level two - Ability to save for retirement and be able to live in retirement without having to worry
Level three - Ability to ensure that if we get really sick, it won't disrupt Level one or level two

An extra dimension would be if we are good on all the others that we can help others. This one is not linear; if we are doing well and have a good year, we donate to others at higher levels. We would probably sell and downsize to a smaller house. We don’t need a house this size, but we love the location and love the neighborhood. That money could go into other money-making ventures that aren’t such a fixed asset. Helpful, Longevity, Simple

The site is super simple – you don’t get lost in tons of tons of pulldown menus and data. The site is based on the questions I have. It was super easy – here is your question, here is the answer. It also seems very straightforward in terms of the steps that someone needed to do to invest and how it worked. 

What piqued my interest was the fact that the company has been around for 140 years and has survived and thrived in all sorts of financial and economic conditions. What did the company learn from that? Are there any tools or products that are needed now in the crisis mode we are in vs. good economic times? It seemed the solution was a) stay the course as an investor or b) Principal is cutting fees to help. But is there more I should be doing?",Boston,ENFJ
285732,Lena ,Korostylova ,lena.korostylova@gmail.com,"She would say that I'm a hard working, dedicated and happy person. She also would add that I'm funny and always happy, I care a lot for my friends and family. Of course she would also say, that I run a lot, my best friend always supports me and never misses a race. Trail running is still a challenge for me and that's what I like about it. Even though it's super nice to run when it's warm and  sunny, you never know under which conditions you will run. When I think of it, I remember super bad wheather, rain, dirt, sometimes snow and most of all I remember how happy I was afterwards. I always feel like I can breathe better, I feel like I let everything negative out and I feel lighter. I noticed that I only feel like this when I do trail running. Light - my head feels very light. I ran all my negative thoughts, everything I worry about out and I have more space in my head for clear thoughts. Strong - even though it's very hard for me I feel like I can achieve anything I want in life. I feel stronger with every run. Proud - even when I had a bad training, I feel very proud that I did it. I think you have to be kind to yourself and allow yorself to be proud of what you did. It's good to strive for progress, but it's also okay to admit how good you are. Most of the time I plan my runs ahead and ask my running friends who wants to join me. When we have a fixed date and time it's easier for me to get up in the mroning, because I know my friends are waiting for me. My motivation is that I know I'm with the people I really like and the feeling afterwards. Most of the time, we go to the hills and parks in Berlin, like the Teufelsberg, Volkspark Humboldthain or to the Grunewald. I think the best run was when the wheather was so so bad and a lot of people showed up. We were so dirty and happy afterwards. We started trail running to switch it up and to get a new challenge. After the marathon we felt really tired of running on the road and needed something new. I don't really think I can say if a prefer running on the road or on trail. They both make me happy in a different way. I like that trail running challnges me and I like that I can breathe better, running on the road is for me more powerful and fast. I feel like I get distracted more when running trail and when I run on the road I have more time to think. Of course I check the wheather conditions to prevent that I'm too hot/too cold. I make sure to stretch my calves, because running uphill or downhill is hard for me and cause my calves to get sore. I wear different shoes than when I'm on the road, when running on soft ground I need less support compared to running on hard asphalt. During the run I try to listen to my breathing and to keep my pace. After the run I stretch properly, I drink a lot and fuel up. I lile to use balms and compression socks when I feel like my legs are very heavy. I would definitely take you to the Teufelsberg , which is a broad hill surrounded by forest. On top is a platform where you can enjoy a really nice view. I would also recommend the Volkspark Humboldthain which has only small Hills but is still challenging because of it soft ground. I don’t think many people in Berlin do trail because it’s still a city , but if you really want to experience trail running it’s not hard to drive a bit off and find some nice spots. Most of the time I get inspired by runners on Instagram. Even though I can’t really name them, I like to read inspiring stories and see their progress. Some of my friends are actively commenting and following several athletes which hey talk about during our trainings. This is where I get my information from and keep up to date. Even hearing about their success and their improvements really inspires me. Traction - a lot of my racing shoes dont really have a grippy outsole as they are meant for running on dry streets. So it doesnt really work for me on Trails. 
 Cushioning - running off roads I need a shoe with more cushioning. Usually that means they are a little bit heavier and chunkier 
 Support - As the terrain is much more challenging than running in the streets, I expect a lot of support from my shoes. They really need to tie in my feet for a stable run Even though I care a lot about the design of shoes , I had to admit that especially when it comes to longer runs you really have to know your body and especially your legs and feet. I struggled a lot because of my sensitive feet and my calves but I never really thought that my shoe choices are responsible for the pain or the right choice could help me to get rid of it. I would give my younger self the advice to make an analysis of my running behavior. I would also advice to talk to Experts to try to combine a nice color/ design with the best fit",Blazer,

She spans the whole thing, she can fast for days and days and then, as if, she can move on to eat like a Roman emperess, indifferently. It is all about unbound spaces.  In standar races, you have a course, you have a distance, a pace etc.. but trails, there is no standard, you just dive in, you do not know what you expect and it could be anything, just move the legs, feet touching the ground and exploring it, there is no step like another on stones, the body reacts to each of them opening up, it becomes incredibly physical, like dancing.  In a recent race, the course went all the way onto a ridge until it touched an area of Triassic chalk formations that ended up in a canyon over a river, 400mt down.

 Fresh and salty, it is like the smell of grass, the earth, the trees, all toxins come out, salt on the skin and water, 
 Flying like a bird, like surfing, at low range on top of soft things Some races just are something else.  There is this mountain somewhere on the Appennines, a place I had not really been before, ever.  So, it is a very weird shape, loke a table thrusting out of the hills, hills are green and wooded, the rock is - bare, stone, grey, basalt, hard, like a table, an altar.  and then grass and woods on top of it. it looks like a something that one day will explode out of the land and send shrapnels all around for hundreds of miles.  So I randomly come across this race and a few pictures on the site and out of instinct I sign up for the following weekend. we drive through woods and as we climb it is going from baking hot to fresh to cold and still we are not done.  Land of smugglers, wars and poverty, we stay at the house of a local painter who tells us the story of this mountain, very mysterious rites, apparently the etruscans already used it for ritual sacrifices.  This lady tells me the story of one night when with a friend she had planned to go out in summer and sleep on this table top of the mountain but in the middle of the night she wakes up and feels this very malignant force all around her pressing hard and felt in absolute danger, they had to run off the mountain and go back as fast as possible.  The day after I am there on that very mountain running up, early morning the woods are still misty, very weird, very spooky.  Then I get back home and weeks later I tell this story to a friend of mine, and she just goes off with one word. Satanist rites. Very widespread in centuries in the area. I am a very rational person. Oh crikey.  It makes me feel I have been to places and travelled back in time, if people were living here they also would run for fear, for cover, for life.  Not all races leave a mark for what they are and this one was the only race when I absoutely could not think about anything else than this, just run. I live on the Italian Prealps, loads of runners on the mountains around and of course loads of skyaces and trails around.  It was seamless and also road racing is getting a bit... unsavoury, in a way it becomes repetitive, it is all about effort. Effort is diferent than fatigue, effort is calculated, fatigue is primal, it is raw and meaty, it is first desperation and then liberation, it is a process. Effort is a stylistic exercise afterall, the appeal lasts for a while but then fades away, one runs back to the start and leaves nothing behind. A trail is like travel across lands, ages, time, it is leaving things behind, embracing change, observing, growing it in until destination.   Running on trail is also about wiring feet into the earth, feeling the soft padded grass under the feet, sending the body into flights, legs have more freedom than on the road, uneven steady grounds call for grace, levity, lightness, all those that bang on the ground in trail and mountain races get injured. The earth takes no beat up, it returns gentleness if one lands gentle.  There also is a different type of cameraderie in trail runs.  It is as if noone dares dusturb nature with one's presence and we are all a it more respectful, less noisy, more aware of our limitations and more supportive of each other, helping the guy near you who struggles, there are no age groups and there is a little more sense of contentment for being there compared with road races.   Much nicer kit as well :)) In fact, there is nothing special, but maybe there is and I perceive it as nothing special.    All my running is a 'sacred space' so the time I put on shorts and shoes, it is as if I take a break from the rest of the world.  No phone unless I am going to a remote pace, almost never food, I normally would map out water points on the course or drink before I go and that is it.   I take with me my footpod, heart rate monitor and music. I do not associate nature with silence, but I like to have the right music that works with the environment, although sometime I need all my five senses and the music goes off.   During the run, I need to keep my concentration on parts of my body, I like to feel and map the movements and to find out whether instinctivly my body finds new ways to negotiate the space. one of the things I like are tree root knots, it reminds me of pavement games when I was a little girl, jumping from a round drawn in chalk to another. playing around. There are 3 environments I have available tightly knitted in the geography: water, mountains and hills.  I live near a small lake with a trail all round it (10 miles) but I often go trail running alongside a river nearby which is in a regional nature reserve, flat and long (abt 20 miles at least). Second choice, I can use agricoltural roads and wood paths that were used in the past to move between villages, these tend to go up and down rolling hills around the lake. finally the area near me has rocky mountains that are used for sky races, so we wither run up the paths or run up the roads used by forest guards and maintenance vehicles. 
 There are plenty of local races that use the hills or the mountains in the area, pretty much every other weekend there would be a race so you'd get to go to one.  Or I woudl take you on the trail that goes up the mountin here below in the picture because from top one can see both brances of lake Como, it is like being on top of the world.  
 Shopwise, we are not as well wndowed as we are o mountains.  There are a couple of them but only one I'd recommend because it is run by runners - and hard goats at that - so they know best, other larger chains are too undifferentiated in their kit supply to be of relevance.  I like things that are not mainstream (not just as attitude but it it just a fact). I definitely would never take another runner to a place where 80% of womens kit is pinked up. I use Strava a lot - also to find races and to explore courses, because I have a good network of peole that do similar things to the ones I like and also I like to get the feel for what a particular course really feels like.  This is how I decide my races (bar the road ones).  I use runultra.co.uk and ultramarathonrunning.com becuse they are  the most informative.  I regularly trawl through their race listings to find events I would like to go to, according to how far they are and what is feasible in my schedule.    Trail athletes, not so much.  I rarely get drawn to what they post on FB, instagram and the likes - it is all promotional stuff, all about the glory of enthousiasm, the heart, generosity and all stuff endorphin-coated to be frank, but  this is what they are fed to post by their PRs and it does not really motivate me.  I would really like to know what they do during the runs, how they handle certain things, what makes or breaks their training, but they rarely talk about these things, in fact, only if part of some promotional activity.  I follow other types of people instead, so strength coaches, unconventional approaches to training, people that have a more geeky understanding of what it means to run.  One exception is maybe Sage Canaday because he is more real than others. grip on mixed terrains. Anything that grips on mud over rocks will get me for good 
 Comfort.  Shoes are like a second skin, they should feel like silk. 
 Weight, weight weight, one of the issue with some of the salomon shoes is that they feel like mountain boots without the leather my first pair was brooks cascadia.  I would have thought that space in the toe is key although one should study the terrain in advance and ouch the most versatile possible shoes. La sportiva has a very useful on line classification of which shoe does best. Inov 8 has something similar but very rudimentary",Blazer,
285729,sergio,palomo,spalomo@gmail.com,"Sergio is a quiet guy. While being warm and polite to people, he likes his own space.  He's always ready for new experiences and trips, specially to the wild. The list of places he would like to visit has no end, but he is not in a hurry. Although family life has taught him the need of planning, he enjoys the unexpected, those special moments that happen when you are at the right place at the right time. First of all, trail running gave me a second chance in running. I used to run on asphalt, but at some point the hard impact affected my knees to the point that running was not fun anymore and I quitted. This does not happen in trails. The natural change of rhythms, of landscapes, the fresh air, forces me to stay on focus while running but relaxes at the same time. Being in the wilderness, puts me in the right perspective. We, humans, are very small, part of something bigger and not at its center. Relaxed, h appy and s atisfied. I think all those words reflect on  a very nice mixture of feeling both tired and energized at the same time. The thought of knowing that I have achieved at least something meaningful for me that day that is good for both my body and mind results in a very nice feeling. Motivation: it was a longer that usual. I'm not interested in running faster, but I find a very appealing challenge in the endurance of longer distances. Before feelings: nervous, the uncertainty of not knowing if I will be able to reach the goal After feeling: extremely tired but extremely happy. The run was close to Kuusamo, in Finnish Lapland.  I went with a friend. We did not run together, we have different conditions and goals, but sharing the nerves in the beginning and the joy in the goal is very important. It is the longest distance I've done, and the setup of an extremely beautiful Finnish national park got me hooked into trails. A friend got me into it. He had similar problems I had with road running and he recommended me to give a try to trails. I quitted road running some time ago. The hard impact caused too much pain in my knees. Trails are much softer which result in far less impact. Also, I don't feel obliged to run all the time when going up. It is OK to walk in certain points. Being able to slow down the pace now and then and enjoy the views is part of the deal. Before: while warming up, think how long I want / can / should run, depending on other plans, feel and run recently. Decide on the route. When I don't have too much time to run I choose a pretty known route. When I have a bit more of time, I just decide on the target area and direction During: feel my body, how does it react to the running and adapt the running to those feelings After: stretching session and shower. If I have the time some self-massage to my calves and feet. Trails are pretty reachable from Helsinki. You don't need to go far by car to start running, you can do it almost from your house door, but I would probably take you Nuuksio, and National Park about 30 minutes from Helsinki. It's full of paths. There's a nice trail run there http://nuuksioclassic.com/en/ . If you want something more remote I can recommend https://nutskarhunkierros.fi/e... and next year I would like to join https://nutsyllaspallas.com/en... both in Lapland. There's no specialized trail running shops in Helsinki. I get my gear from outdoors shops https://www.partioaitta.fi/ken... , and general running shop http://www.4runners.fi Q4: You got me here. I don't follow anything other than my reduced group of friends who run. They are the ones who recommend this or that event. Q5: Same applies to people. My reduced circle of friends. We have quite a variety of skills and conditions. The ones who are at the top are certainly inspiring, and the fact they are close enough makes them reachable, not too far away. We follow each other mostly at Strava. Q6: barefoot, protection and durability Q7: 
 If a brand could only do a light but durable barefoot shoe which still protects my feet from rocks and hard terrains and which is produced in fair and sustainable conditions for the people who manufacture them, it would make my trail running shoes perfect! My first shoes were actually perfect. I think they are a good reason I engaged in trail running. They offered the right combination of barefoot feeling and protection required in trails. My second pair are not that good. The inclination goes to the protection side resulting in harder shoes that do not provide the barefoot experience I like. My recommendation would be to stay with the balance between flexibility and protection.",Blazer,

With his positive attitude he can make even strangers wanna try new things. Always comes up with a billion crazy plans and its always funny to see which are not going to happen. Jay is kind and even if he us braggy, he will always be there to help people Trail running is one tough freaking path to choose. Its highly demanding, if you truly wanna be a trail runner, training is hard, it will never let you rest. Trail running to me is not only a hobby, its my whole life around it. Its mapping routes through high altitude mountain trails, its hours of stalking googke earth for new ridges to run. Trail running is a combo of pure freedom and precice planning. The days before a bigger run are magic. I look at my mapping every hour or so, I constantly check the weather and get myself mentally ready for what I am about to conquer. The first deep breath when I arrive on location charges me up, the majestic mountains, still in the dark make euphoric sometimes I tear up when I realise what awaits me. As soon as my garmin bleeps: I black out. I am free. Up there, between million years old rock, I understand my vulnerability, my limited time on earth.Trail running to me is not my sport, its a window into my meaning of life. Epic. Done. Alive. 
 As a mountain runner, coming back from my run, I always feel like I have achieved something outstanding. My legs are burning, I feel dizzy and I wanna hug everyone and everything. Whenever I go all out, I feel like everyone around me, gave their little part to me doing epic stuff out there. That warm feeling of awesome is something that sometimes fuels me up for many days after my run. The crazy amount of blood that pumped through my body makes me feel cleaned and reset. My mind feels strong and saucy. The most amazing run of my trail running career was my ridiculous plan to run 100k in Mallorca and climb the Puig Major while doing so. The whole project was insane and up until today, I can still not understand how I pulled this one off. Even for big mouth me, that still seems sureal. When I was landing in Mallorca early this year, the weather on the island was far from nice. It rained and, according to locals, it was the coldest they have ever experienced. I had 8 days to decide which day I was going to conquer my insane run. The weather app and the ice cold and lonely nights made me question the whome thing and in the designated night, the weather gave me a rainy welcome. But it was on. Almost 15 kilo if gear in my backpack I faced 16.5h of insanity. I could tell you a billion details but I headed out into the night all by myself on a mapped unknown route, 42km on road, in the middle of the night to a completely unknown mountain area, to climb a mountain with a military base on it on an Island where I have never been before. And I did exactly that. It was so ridiculous that on parts of the route i had to run/crawl through tunnels of a hydroplant and rock climb straight up walls. I saw rockfall, a car crash and bought a 11 € 2,5dl fantan can, met fellow swiss people and got ripped off by a drunk cab driver on my way back to my hotel. It was awesome and proof to everyone that insane plans are a.) worth trying and can b.) work out just exactly as planned. Q4: I one day ran Grindelwald after following the journey of my coach and the pro ultra runner Ian Morgan. I ran completely wrong for hours and did a for me back then staggering 26k and 1200 m climb under the most amazing views I have ever seen. I was laying next to my car for hours after the run completely depleted and exhausted knowing I wanna run here forever. Q5 beside mountain trails, regular trails also are absolutely prefered any other path. Its soft, the air is awesome, elevation rules and there is nothing feeling as fast running as if you run on a small trail in the woods. The trees give you an understanding of your speed and make you feel like you are flying. Mountain trails are just like you take it to new heights, heh. Q7: I believe I am a bit of a special case when it comes to planning. To me my definition of trail running includes the mountains. I spend hours finding new hidden gems using all map creators and even google earth to discover mountain areas. When mapped at the days before running, I start planning gear: where am I, what condition. How shall I look. The eve before I lay out all gear and pack it, including nutrition for the path. The shoe, I usually choose in the morning. In the morning I eat and put on my race gear and Gear to change. I select the shoe and double check the looks as I hype to take pictures I like function and unique style. Then I drive to the spot, gear up, run, enjoy, take pics and come back to eat till I feel like a bubble. The moments and days after the run leave me happy and fueled up I would show you the „Suntower“. The area has so nany forresr trails including an amazing river trail with a length of over 45km without major cities on it. I would recommend you to run from Rheinfelden to Basel on the river. Shops is a bit frustrating tho as there are none really.... Q4: i do follow sone news from time to time mostly through Instagram. A good friend of mine is Ian Morgan @ian.morgan who is a pro trail runner from new zealand abd keeps me posted. Also I watch a lot jf youtube movies and follow a huge bunch of trail runnerd on instagram Q5: well i mentioned ian morgan already. He inspires me cause he is training hard and I connect to him also on a joke and life attitude basis. As he became a good friend he still kept being a major idol in the sport: persistant, humble, epic. I follow him in person and Instagram. His gf @frangibar is also someone I follow closely, kilian jornet of course and a few „not yet famous“ people such as @catcreegan etc its always a mix between social media followers and people become real life friends and you chat with them in person Q6: durability, style and positive reviews 
 Q7: a shoe using the full bandwith of technology. Specially when it comes to a durable shoe, companies have profits before quality which is frustrating as shoes could also be a bit more pricey but include a mire reliable quality. Words words words 50 xD Try not to save money. Try out many pairs. Spend time finding the right ones not only focusing on optics but on what other people experienced while using them. Focusing on owning several pairs of high quality shoe and not only use obe pair in the beginning. Words words words",Blazer,

He loves his fashion, though he's no fashionista. timeless and quality products are important. He loves his blue jeans and white t-shirts. Trail running gives me another reason to leave the urban life. its easy to get caught up in a hectic city, therefor its always a much needed break and necessary get away. It makes you feel free and gives you the opportunity to explore new places, whereas running in an urban environment can get really repetitive. exhausted - of course a long run will drain your batteries but running off roads is always harder as the terrain is softer, ever changing and going really random routes 
 fresh - running around some hills or through Forrests makes me feel fresh. clean air in the country side is amazing 
 hangry - when I run I always get really hungry but at the same time im to exhausted to eat, which usually has me in a bad mood or gets me angry this run was annoying at first but turned out to be one of the best memories. It was in the middle of winter, my girlfriend and I were supposed to go on another long run in preparation for a marathon. Neither of us was really in a mood for running but we set out anyway. This run lead us to a couple of lakes that we like to go to in the summer. by the time we got there we were already dying of exhaustion and felt like turning around. Though to our surprise, the entire lake was frozen and tons of people were Ice skating as the sun was out. We decided to take a break in the sun and went onto the ice and walked across the like. At the end we finished our run and our little break made this one a really special one, that I always like to remember Trail Running core of came naturally to me. I grew up in the country side outside of berlin and a lot of times I would join my dad on his runs. Either on a bike or running as well. He preferred to run in quieter areas so we would normally set out to hit the woods or lakes.  Of course running cross country is really different to urban running. Sometimes I enjoy a softer, more challenging surface. As well as running in a sort of cross was as trial go left to right, up and down and not only straight like a road.  Though running on a road feels more responsive to me. It kind of gives me more feedback and feels like I need less energy or less support from my footwear this is really nothing special for me/us. we usually only set out for trail runs when we want to cover longer distances, which usually only is when we are preparing for a marathon or bigger races . Therefor we have long runs set in our training plan and sort of know when we will go out for longer/trail runs.   As for the run itself we really only prepare in terms of checking the route and area we are going to be in, to sort of have an idea to run enough but not to far. afterwards we usually make sure to go and grab food together as a group and cool down that way I don't think I am very fond of the local Trail running scene. The Berlin Braves are an urban running club and most of us never leave the city. The ones that do (like me) usually head out to areas that we don't know to well, so we hardly know any of the people. The people we do come across seam to run by themselves or also in smaller groups.  I would head out to Brandenburg with you guys. There is plenty of lakes and woods to explore. Generally I prefer to run around lakes or along the water as I enjoy the scenery a lot more than running in a forrest that has no water. for this I have to refer to the BTG (bridge the gap) Movement. its basically a movement of urban running crews from all over the world. it started out in New York and spread like a wild fire all over the world. No there is so many crews that its hard to keep count and connect with all the people.  its a fairly young movement so there is no publications or official organisations. since most people are young and super fund of social media and the internet we generally stay in touch through social media. Every crew has an online presence and we connect through that. on a personal level we stay in touch offline, digitally of course but not as a Facebook group or anything like that.  If I had to point out any athlete, I would name Eluid Kipchoge. The best Long distance runner ever. He just recently broke the marathon world record by like 80 seconds. I keep up to date with his activities vie social media. In generell I would say that social media is the biggest factor in everything that we do related to running. it also helps to connect with people all over the world and to share experience and knowledge first and foremost I look for support. I need stability for trail runs and a lot of lighter shoes don't have that. Next I don't want them to have to soft of a cushioning as the terrain usually already is soft and unstable. Lastly they need to fit my style and be somewhat weather proof. I don't want wet feet or soaked socks/shoes. They also need to clean up nice. I  hate running in dirty shoes. 
 If a brand could only make a shoe that is sleek and gives me the necessary support, it would male my trail running perfect Try not to buy into what other people tell you, you need. Start out basic, maybe even with what you have. You don't want to have to much gear! Choose what makes you feel comfortable and confident. Don't overthink it! Just run, after all thats why you started in the first place.",Blazer,

Likes the outdoors, sports, racing and live music. Hard to get a hold of him at home. Freedom to run anywhere, no matter how rough the terrain. Perfect combination of running and hiking, mix all things I like about running long distance with my love for the mountains. No need to get obsessed with training plans, and train checking pace, etc. Trail racing is far more metaphysical than running on asphalt, trail runners are more relaxed comepared with asphalt runners, and offer more companionship during events. Running on trails makes me feel very in touch with nature. Feel very synchronized with the environment while running, as part of the mountains, at the same time the trails makes me keep concentration on what I am doing, otherwise the risk of falling or injury is very high. The after run sensation is great, great feeling of accomplishment, always take some memories back. Definitely a very particular ultra trail race. The Ultra Trail SierrasSierra del Bandolero UTSB 86km. It was an epic racing day, after one weekend of poor weather conditions, race day was no better. Felt ready for the challenge, basically in the zone since the start line. A tough event with over 50% drop out, managed to cross the finish line, completely enpty. Had been doing the triathlon scene on and off for a few years, also MTB racing and road cycling. Loved long events such as Ironman distance. Was asked to run on trails by friends who knew I liked hiking and backpacking, fell in love wirh running trails the very first time. Very different to asphalt racing, preparing for events is different, no need to be obsessed with pacing and time keeping. Fellow trail runners are more relaxed, and always willing to help. The racing scene is much more familiar. Well, routine depends a lot on the type of event I am preparing. For long runs over three hours there is some deal in preparing.  First is checking weather report, and choose appropriate clothing and shoes, and other stuff. If hot need to consider routes as hydration is an issue. Make sure GPS watch is charged, and phone is fully charged, just in case of emergency.  
 After run depends on family plans. If time is tight, drive back home, if we have time to spare, have a drink wirh friends, coffee, of lunch before heading back. I will suggest lical trails which are easy technically, and easy to follow, so you don't get lost. That's quite important as a novice.  For a more mountain experience I will take you to the mountains of Malaga or Cadiz, where you can enjoy pure mountain running. Trails will depend on how I evaluate runner experience, and if they have the right equipment.  Grazalema, El Bosque and Benaojan are favorites whwre I will take anyone.  I will recommend local running shops that are trail running specialist. I subscribed to Trail Running Magazine, mostly keep up with what's going on on the international scene and best local events, etc.  Also good source of information for new gear, gear reviews, etc. Follow Spanish site trail running review to compare gear and as a good source of information on gear, specially shoes.  Also a fan of social media and blogs, do not follow a specific site in particular, or athlete but like to read what I may across if it seems interesting. When considering trail running shoes the first feature I look for is drop. Shoes must be under 0,8mm drop otherwise I never buy.  Once I find shoes matching this Criteria I look for other features like cushion and durability. Toe protection is a must. There is no perfect shoe as shoes need to be specific to distances and terrain as racing car tyres, so serious trail runners may need to own at least two shoes. First go out and run easy trails with the gear you have, don't buy in advance, and buy as your needs increase as you gain experience on the trails. Do your research online and read some reviews so you can make a more informed purchase. Buy gear specific for the distance and type of terrain you are going to train or race.",Blazer,

I also feel free and I like to contest against myself and the different goal I was supposed to do. It's also a good way to visit our mountain.

The best was the first one. I discover how hard it was and how we feel good after running in the mountain. The thing which motivated me was just because it was a trail happened in my village. We signed up with my friend, my brother and my cousin. I was pretty excited before the race and completly exhausted after. I knew I could do better, since, I run more. It changed my free time, because I liked it, now in my week-end I run. And I try to race once a month. Q4 : I leave next to a mountain which is perfect to run. 2mn after I close my door, I am in the middle of the forrest. The climb is about 1200m to start. But there's also a lot of trail we can follow. Q5 : I use to run on a road to keep shape. I run few 10km race. But since I started to practice trail, I prefer this sport. I like when the area change, climb, descent, flat, and where we run in the forrest, in the desert, next to waterfall, the view (with the massif du Mont Blanc where I am from) I usually run early in the morning, I don't like running in the evening. So usually the day before, I program my 3 days of training (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). On friday I run in a trail for 1h 200-600m of climb 8-12km. The saturday, I run a bigger one, 800m-1400m between 15 to 28km (2h30 to 3h30), and the sunday I run 2 hours, it depends how I feel for the climb. I start running between 6.30am-9.00am, I just want to be back home for 11.30. My routine is, I run for 10mn on a road pretty flat, then I stretch, I do my run, and when I am back home, I strech but longer. Lucky I am my wife do some massage when I feel to tired! In the week of a race, I try not running, but I do some home cycling every day for 20mn to 30mn. My local trail running scene is very diverse! From the village to the top of the mountain, between forest and open spaces, you'll be sure to find something you like!  I would take you in the Fiz moutain range, right next to my home where I'm used to running.  A few diffierent runs I could recommend would be :  - ""Balcons des Fiz"" just for a nice warm up - ""Varan refuge"" - a bit steeper but still very accessible as not too long - ""Plaine joux"" from ""Varan"" - a bit longer but the view is stunning! -""Tour des Fiz, désert de platé"" - long, steep, with many different landscapes. Just amazing 
 I would take you to Quechua Mountain Store, a store where research is done in the Chamonix valley for all of the sports apparel. I used to work as a model for them.  I would also take you to Le Vieux campeur, they have many different brands whereas Quechua has mostly their brand. I go on the websites and usually go to the same trails each year, sometimes varying the amount of kilometers I run. With time and when sharing with other friends who run, we get to know a lot of the different trails that exist. I don't use social media so that's not where I get my information, it's a good thing classical websites are still used! 
 The only two athletes I follow are Kilian Jornet and François D'haene. Kilian Jornet lives in Chamonix when he's not traveling elsewhere, and François D'haene won the UTMB two years ago. They inspire me because they do amazing things, and mostly François D'haene has a normal life, a wife, two kids, and... a vineyard!  I don't follow what they do closely, however if something appears in the local newspaper, that's usually how I hear about it, and friends who follow more closely what they do. This is the website I use to see the different existing trails http://www.courzyvite.run/Cale... My top three things are -Comfort They aren't too tight, my feet are wide, and soft on the top -Light  -Reliable I know they won't rip or get a hole unexpectedly If a brand could only do a local and environmentally friendly shoe, it would make my trail running shoes perfect I used to play indoor activitie and I started running with my basketball shoes. They were too heavy and didn't grip the floor. Also I use to wear any random sock which burned my feet. So I will advice a new runner to choose one pair of shoes which are more adapted to our place (light but sturdy)",Blazer,

Hungry is probably self explanatory and it’s one of the reasons why most of us run anyway, isn’t it? ;) Happy. After a beautiful day out, no matter if you gave your best, or you had a hard time. You went and you did it. Satification is probably part of the happiness as well.  Whole.

I’m always very excited before weekend as I can’t wait where my legs will take me. It may not always be beautiful mid run but at the end of the day, it is always worth it! I’ve started running about 6 years ago. Living in London running obviously meant road running. Started with half marathons but shorty after I’ve discovered I don’t enjoy the competitive side of road running. Trails came as natural transition. Soft ground, runs with friends, exploring new places, stopping for a cake mid 30k fun run... and then mountains. Moving through technical terrain much faster than hiking with heavy backpack will ever allow you. Since moving to Alps, I haven’t ran on road once. and I’ve never looked back either:) Trail runs - especially the longer ones- need a bit of planning. Checking the weather in advance and always packing that one extra layer just in case (and sun cream!). Sometimes I just go and explore but usually I tend to plan the route in advance especially if it requires taking train or bus to the start or finish. Depending on the distance I’m planning to run, I pack according amount of water and snack. Depending on weather I pick up also the shoes- if it’s muddy i go for pair with good grip. After the run it is time to cool down, strech a bit, shower, eat and start plotting next adventures :grinning: Chamonix, the capital of trail running. Where you feel so small surrounded by so much beauty. Wherever you look, there are mountains. Siting in valley at 1000m the peaks around are breathtaking no matter the season. 
 I would take you everywhere!! To the biggest classics belong VK, Montenvers, Plan d'Aiguille and Floria.  But I would take you to Mont Buet and La Jonction. Steep, brutal, beautiful! The surrounding area easily accessible by train is stunning as well and so different - Tour de Fiz is a must do race in the area! 
 There are plenty great shops, branded ones but also those which sell mixture of brands including Snell and Ravanel. Oh I love Instagram! I follow almost all ultra trail runners, race pages and organisations like Ultra Trail World Tour etc. Salomon TV has some great, inspirational movies and all of them are in full length on youtube! I managed to meet some of the big names from the trail running scenes and they are just normal everyday people who just happen to run a little bit more extraordinary. ITRA is great source of races all around the world. With option to search for race based on distance, points, country, month. Most of them link to the race website which then gives you extra options to explore particular races. Kilian Jornet for sure. He is SO humble considering he is the best athlete on the trail running scene for couple of years. Ueli Steck is a person that will forever inspire me. As mentioned I'm mainly active on instagram, but as much as I love social media, I also love reading about running and buy every single book available :slight_smile: Top three things are: good fit for sure - no blisters nor hotspots is a must! Then comfort - shoes must feel like second skin but giving enough support when running on trails. Colour is the third one for me - yes, really (SORRY AGAIN! :D) If a brand could only do shoes that will be more durable, it  would make my trail running shoes perfect! I would tell myself to explore more online but then again, when I started running, there were not that many shoes to choose from as the sport just started growing as discipline. My first pair were North Face shoes and they were everything but comfortable but as I didn't knew anything else back then, I wore them for quite a while. But then again, I wasn't running as much as I'm running now so it didn't really made such a huge difference",Blazer,
285743,Emma,Burton,goingforaburton@hotmail.com,"Motivated, fun and inspirational. Emma needs another life to fit in everything and she doesn't like wasting time. Her initial response to being asked to do something is yes as she hates missing out. She is always happy and is very focused with setting herself regular goals both physically and mentally. Staying fit and healthy is very important to her so whilst she enjoys nights out and parties she also likes to balance this with healthy eating and exercise. Trail running allows me to stay fit and healthy and have time away from reality, computers and the internet. I run because I love the feeling of achievement and satisfaction and the awareness of growing stronger and healthier. Most of my runs are with my husband though I have recently started running and exercising with local based Chamonix groups and can see the motivational benefits this brings. Primarily its a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment.  It clears my head and answers a lot of questions I have going on on my head.  I also use the time to mentally plan my day and decide which tasks need completing and I rank these in order of importance. Once home I write these down and start to work through these.  Completing these provides great satisfaction. Motivation is never a problem as I'm always ready and looking forward to my runs. Generally I run first thing in the morning before breakfast as I find I have more energy and it sets me up for the day. I start from my house with my labrador Roo and aim to run to Les Tines, and back which is around 10 miles. Within 50 metres of leaving my door I am on trails and I don't see anyone else for the next 2 hours. I climb sharply to join the Balcon Sud which runs all the way through the Chamonix valley and gives the option of the grand balcon, or petit balcon. I prefer the petit balcon as it allows me to run the majority of the route whereas the grand balcon involves more uphill hiking. Every time I run this route it seems better than the last time. I spot something new, I run slightly quicker, maybe a red squirrel appears from nowhere or maybe I'm just in the groove. Some days I feel like I can run forever, today is one of those days. I left the UK in 2014 and spent the next 2 years travelling through Europe in a Motorhome. 21 countries and over 200 miles. From Norway to Morocco. Poland to Croatia. We had no plans and no route, instead we followed the sun. Not too sunbathe but to avoid the rain. With beautiful scenery, beaches and mountains, and plenty of time to explore my running and fitness improved and instead of grabbing a run before work, or during lunch I was now finding myself out for 2,3, 4 hours.  As we have dogs we avoided cities and spent most of our time off the beaten track on mountain trails or beach cliff tops.  I dislike, and am sensitive to pollution so definitely prefer traffic free trails. Avoiding roads is a big part of planning a route. I find I run every other day as I like time to recover and have plenty other things going on so don't want to feel wiped out after my run.  The night before is when I prepare my kit and hydration so that everything is ready to get up and out. I use a mixture of brands, salomon, patatagonia, millet, arcteryx, brooks, tailwind. I dont eat beforehand though I do have a shot of coffee which is the only time I drink caffeine. On my run I may have some water mixed with tailwind. Following an early morning run I will have a shower and then my breakfast. Muesli, banana, dried fruit, nuts, cinnamon, rice milk. Possibly a recovery drink depending how long I have been out and what else I have planned that day. I dont use strava or record my runs. I run for self satisfaction Chamonix has no shortage of places to run or groups to join in with. Suggesting a route would depend on your fitness as there are a lot of hills and elevation here which could demotivate someone new to the trails. If you're new to trails and looking to run in a group there are three regular options. Chloe Lanthier is the Patagonia ambassador and the store offers monthly breakfast runs led by Chloe. 50 minutes followed by breakfast at the store. Usually around 8 people turn up, a mix of locals and people passing through. Jana Studzinki offers a weekly friday morning run through her group Wild Trails, again around 50-60 minutes before work, alternating between 3 different routes. Sam Brooks offers a weekly track session during summer. 75 minutes of warm up/coll down and drills. She also brings an esky so the sessions are followed with a beer, or soft drink.  During prime summer, Mont Blanc Marathon and UTMB week, stores such as North Face and Patagonia offer regular runs with their ambassadors who are here competing in the events. Very friendly and inclusive. All of the above are free. To be honest I get most of my information from my husband Paul. He uses both instagram and facebook to follow athletes and local groups and stores. There is a closing party after the UTMB and this is well attended by some of the elite athletes.  I have met and spoke to Tim Tollefson, Zach Miller and David Laney and these are my favourites. Look, fit and performance. The shoe needs to look good and fit in with my running wardrobe. It also needs to be comfy and not need any breaking in. It needs to be able to perform well on mountains trails, rocks and wet and dry surfaces. If a brand could only do resoling and prevent tears around the front section, it would make my trail running shoes perfect. Wow, I didn't have a clue about cushioning and performance. I initially purchased my shoes from Decathlon as these are Europe wide so I could pick them up from wherever we were passing through. The internet makes things easier so research is important but in terms of advice I'd say choose up to a full size bigger if you intend on running long distances as your feet do swell.",Blazer,
285736,Roberto,Bertuol,rbertuol@robertobertuol.com,"Impulsive, fun loving, determined, a bit rude and outspoken. Very generous and honest but do not cross my path :wink: Recently I mellowed down I guess because of the 2 kids, but still feel I am teenager trapped in the body of a middle age man. I guess you agree Daniele? Trail running is freedom, exertion, pain and black toe nails. It's one of the best way of keeping in touch with extreme nature and push your limits both physical, mental and technical. I used to do lots of trail running in the Alps. Now Snowdon is the closest. Weather on Snowdon is unpredictable so, probably less technical but equally challenging. Zen, exhaustion, happiness. Trail running is cathartic and gives you a feeling of complete calm and achievement. It' exhausting because you use every part of your body for balancing. It's happiness because you ran through nature and you did it and now you can go and have a hot shower! This summer and went on holidays to Ll ança in Catalonia. I was with wife and my two young kids and was planning to relax. I saw this trail run advertised by the local tourist board. 14k on the mountains with beautiful views at sunset. I could not resist and even if I didn't have my trail running shoes with me I decided to join. This was the hardest and most beautiful run I have ever done. Never ran at sunset and never in such a beautiful location between sea and mountains. Me and another French guy were actually the only foreigners, the others were all superfit locals who do this once a week. The difficulty of the terrain, wrong shoes, no headtorch made it one of the most difficult run ever for me, but the landscape and scenery was breathtaking. So jealous these guys can do it every week... Just by chance. I like to try new things. I am not a particularly fast runner nor enjoy jogging a great deal. I do find it boring...however trail running is fun because you have to constantly re-balance your body, re-position your feet and adapt the run to different grounds. In addition to this, you get to see incredible views on the way. I usually study the path on a map, get my gear and drink ready. Charge my phone just in case and warm up. My warm up routing consist in calf raises (I do have a tendinopathy...) squats and stretching. After the run I do some stretching sit down and enjoy the after-feeling of exhaustion and think about how I could have gone slower on certain bits and faster on others. No much trail running in Brum so the closest is Snowdon. Car from Birmingham to llanberis. There are plenty of tracks up there. I am a fair weather runner (I am originally Italian) but most of the times I run in the rain, mist and cold. I usually shop for my shoes in runners world or Snow & rock but then I buy them online after I tried them. I buy cheap shoes for my Wolf Run stints in Sports Direct because after the mud and swim in the lake they are pretty much unusable or have little life left in them. I do searches on the internet using the name of particular locations I am interested. Otherwise I check with friends locally or abroad, mainly Spain and Italy. I joined a few FB groups such as the Trail Running Association ( https://www.facebook.com/group... ) occasionally I buy the Trail running magazine or check their website or FB group for news and tips. One of my best friend is a sky instructor at Les deux Alpes and I usually join him in summer for a few mad run tracks that only him knows. I trust is not going to get me into too much trouble. I do not really look up at anyone in particular. I usually get inspired either by other people's mini adventures or by my friends. When someone sounds enthusiastic and the experience sounds interesting and fun, that's enough to inspire me. I like to listen to stories rather than read about them. If a brand could do a pair of shoes with a sole that changes its rigidity depending on the terrain and does not get soaked and heavy when you run in puddles, that'll be perfect. Also why multilayer soles detach at some point, is there a technology that can actually bond them together rather than ""glue"" the layers? Don't be in a hurry to buy shoes. Do your research, try dozens of shoes. Walk, bend and go up and down the stairs in the shop and don't feel pressurised by the sales assistant. Bad shoes can really make your run unpleasant as well as cause injuries that takes months to heal.",Blazer,
285738,William,Lockwood,williamglockwood@googlemail.com,"I hope that they would describe me as a positive person. I'm lucky to have some very talented and accomplished friends and I love to be a cheerleader for them wherever I can. I am inspired by them in a lot of different realms -- for example teaching, art and sport -- and I hope that I can show them a thing or two as well. I try to be proactive in keeping touch with my friends and in being involved with each other's lives. I will never miss an opportunity to do something for them or to spend time with them. Trail running gives me a sense of peace and perspective that nothing else can, especially living in a big city. Even a familiar trail can feel different every time you run it. I love the combination of physical activity and beautiful scenery, and the challenge of negotiating technical terrain. Sharing the trail with other people can be great, as can a meditative solo run. Trail running is just good for the soul. (Plus, it's good for my knees.)
The pictures I've attached are from the 70.5-mile Laurel Highlands Ultra in Pennsylvania last year, which I ran with my friend Anh-Tuan. The climbing and terrain were absurdly challenging and the scenery was absurdly beautiful. We were very lucky to have an excellent crew, while the fact that we were way at the back of the field meant that we mostly had the trail to ourselves! It summed up the combination of beauty, challenge, camaraderie and ultimately achievement that trail running represents to me. Peaceful; motivated; ready. Peaceful after having my perspective properly shoogled back into place by the run; motivated by the act of movement and by getting the endorphins firing; and ready to take on whatever the day has lined up for me. It's a very particular combination of factors. The trail has given me some thinking time, stretched my legs and brought fresh air. I'm ready for anything, but not running around like a headless chicken. I'm on an even keel but with an inner resolve I know I can call upon whenever it's required. The run that springs to mind is a trail run on the South Downs Way with my girlfriend Cynthia and friends Erika and Chris. We discovered that Lewes train station to Eastbourne pier down the SDW is exactly 26.2 miles, and decided to run it one sunny Sunday morning. The weather and the scenery were outrageously beautiful, the company was fantastic and the route was broadly very challenging (especially the Seven Sisters hill leading into Eastbourne). Our motivation  was just taking a notion to do  it, which I particularly  enjoy when thinking back on it. I loved that my friends would just come along for this kind of endeavour, filling up our water bladders at a cafe but otherwise unsupported. That's what made it so special.  This run was harder than most organised marathons but we kept each other going with high spirits and stupid jokes. 
 Afterwards we definitely felt pretty tired and pretty battered, but felt a warm glow after a dip in the Channel as we ate fish and chips on Eastbourne beach. (That glow was, of course, sunburn.) I got into trail running almost by accident. I started running on the road in Dundee as a way to lose weight, but it took moving to London for me to appreciate the beauty of Scottish trails. I started running with a group in Epping Forest and began investigating trails whenever I went home to Dunblane. Now, it's my favourite thing. The challenge of the trail is very different to the road. It is often technical underfoot, while the camber and elevation can change dramatically with little warning. That leads to a certain subconscious focus that helps me reach a meditative level that doesn't happen on the road. Even when the scenery isn't outrageously beautiful, you can still lose yourself in nature. I love testing myself over set distances on the road, and seeing new places in that context, whereas trails are less focused on stats and numbers and more on feel. I love that. Given the option, I will always choose trails. If I'm going to run a trail in Scotland, the first thing I look for is appropriate footwear. (If I'm in London, the first thing I check is whether or not the appropriate Tube lines are running.) Road shoes are not really suitable for muddy or icy paths or for crossing streams. I'm a fan of Mizuno, Brooks and Saucony trail shoes. Footwear is followed by proper layers and waterproofs, depending on the conditions -- I don't want to be too hot, too cold or too wet -- and a headtorch if it's going to be a terrifying and exhilarating night-time trail run. I nearly always take my phone with me, partly for the rare occasion that I'll need to call someone but mostly to take photos (for my own satisfaction and, let's be honest, for Strava and Instagram). I'll track the run with a GPS watch (either Fitbit or Garmin), mostly because I like to look at the maps afterwards but also, of course, for the benefit of Strava. After jogging to the trailhead I do a set of dynamic stretches to make sure my old, creaking legs are ready to go. I don't tend to push especially hard or try to hit certain paces on the trail but I do try to reach that flow state when everything seems to happen naturally. If it's a trail network I know well I'll string together some loops on the fly, whereas if it's a new one I'll go out and get lost to get a sense for it. Distance really depends on how I'm feeling and I won't think twice about walking technical uphills or stopping to enjoy the scenery. When I get home I'll stretch, foam roll and shower... and hit Strava with a vengeance! The first word I would use to describe the trail running scene in London -- and nearly everywhere else -- is friendly. There's something about this world that attracts welcoming and inclusive people. The first place I would take you, after consulting the London Trail Runners Facebook group, is Epping Forest. It sits on the Central line and yet it feels like the wilderness. You can string together almost any distance you want, but I'd take you on the 10K Epping-Loughton route and finish with a Nando's, before taking the Tube home again. Hampstead Heath would come a close second -- it's easier to reach for most people, but it's also much busier. Shops-wise, I would recommend Run and Become in Victoria or, if you have an interest in triathlon, Bike & Run in East Finchley. The answer to almost all of this is social media. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are invaluable to keeping up with what's happening in the trail world. I read Ultra Running Magazine and iRunFar.com and listen to the Trail Runner Nation and Negative Splits podcasts for interviews and insight. On a local level, I use the London Trail Runners Facebook to organise runs and link up with people, including those just visiting. There are almost too many individual inspirational athletes to name. Rachel Bonner, Tom Payn, Anh-Tuan Tran, Jim Walmsley, Megan Mackie, Kilian Jornet, Andy Jones-Wilkins, Flora Duffy, Emelie Forsberg and David Roche are just some of the folk I look up to in the trail scene. They inspire me by showing that you can achieve extraordinary things if you really want to, without sacrificing anything that makes you unique. I keep up with them via social media and, when I can, in person. Following on from the last question, I look for advice/reviews from people or publications whose judgment I trust; a reasonable price point; and longevity. While I have no issue paying for shoes, I also expect them to last for a couple of years of moderate use before self-destructing. 
 If a brand could only stop tinkering with a winning formula, it would make my trail running shoes perfect! I would say to not look for the biggest discount or cheapest shoes; you get what you pay for. Assistants at running shops know their stuff, so listen to them! A good headtorch is an invaluable investment. I'd also tell myself that I don't need as many layers as I think as I do for a short outing. And lay off the biscuits.",Blazer,
285739,Neil,Williams,kidsnurseneil@gmail.com,"Ah, Neil... Such a lovely chap... He works really hard and always seems to be busy. He's always on a course for work... Or running... And if it's not that, helping at parkrun, or sailing or doing things on classic cars! He's dependable though and I know that if I need any help, I can count on him... He's also great fun and good company to be with; always a nice thing to say... Trail running gives me the opportunity to get into the outdoors, close to nature and enjoy masses of stunning, unrepeatable views and experiences of the countryside. It also provides a challenge... To make it to the end of the run, or race, whatever is placed in the way; a sense of endurance and achievement... I also gain a sense of teamwork and camaraderie with all those participating... Both runners and support teams all work to the end goal; to finish the race, safely and having experienced the best day ever since the last event! It also provides a sense of meaning, relaxation and happiness that I didn't experience before I started running... Tired: Physically tired due to the physical and technical effort involved in the run... Refreshed: At the sights of the countryside I've experienced... A change from the busy city... Also refreshed at leaving the everyday stresses behind, or being able to compartment them to one side, so that when I return, I can start a new week or a new day with new energy... Accomplished: At the ""mission"" accomplished... The sweat, the tears (hopefully no blood!)... Trails runs are tough, but out of that there is a sense of achievement, maybe of getting up the massive hill, or going a further distance, or helping your mates complete the run... The best trail running experience so far is the Purbeck Marathon... Bit of a last minute thing as a mate of mine couldn't do it and transferred his place to me a couple of weeks beforehand... It had been recommended by several running club friends and there were going to be some doing the race... All who had done it before had said how fantastic the views were but also talked about the brutal the ascents... The thought of a rugged, full marathon on trails filled me with excitement... It wasn't going to be about completing in a particular time, but in completing it! And knowing that my club mates would be doing the race alongside me, I couldn't say no! A long drive to get there but I had also been offered a place to stay with some club members so I could even have a beer or two the evening before! The route takes in the Isle of Purbeck and also looking out to sea and the white cliffs of the south coast... Absolutely stunning views to take in... I started out at a decent pace... Two other club mates were doing the full marathon (rather than the shorter 16 mile route)... I was pretty sure I'd come in before them as my pace is generally quicker... Wow, the hills really were brutal... I had to walk up some and by about 20 miles I was really struggling... And then from behind me I heard a voice, ""hello mate!""... 'King' Dave (with 300 marathons to his name) had caught up with me... Seeing the pain on my face, then he said, ""Don't worry, I'm not gonna race you, let's just get to the finish""... I got into some kind of pace for the last mile and kept going, and keeping to his word, Dave just kept behind me willing me on, allowing me to finish half a minute before him! I had also met a British Doctor working in the USA during the race and he had a pint of cider waiting for me as I crossed the line... This was such a good run; the endurance, views and most of all, the friendship and teamwork!... I started out, like many, on roads completing quite a few half marathons and then full marathons... I had already got the running bug... And then the travelling bug, completing some lovely marathons in other European cities... I initially got interested in trail running via my running club who offer trail running locally on Sunday mornings... I found that on my doorstep, we had some fabulous countryside with great views to see. My first trail run was actually in the snow with about 6 or 7 club mates so I had great company too...  Trail running is definitely more challenging due to the very differing surfaces, sometimes soft, other times very slippy on surfaces such as loose rock, dirt and grass... And sometimes ankle deep in mud! This makes for a technically challenging run and good exercise for various muscle groups rather than more 'regular' running on tarmac. It also means you have to stay alert to the different surfaces and the possible dangers the surfaces pose if you are to avoid injury... But equally, trail running surfaces can be forgiving on limbs if it is flat and relatively soft, making for pleasant 'rest' periods between tricky sections!  Trail running makes for a much more interesting run both of the views (generally) and also regarding the running surface with all of its added challenges and possible dangers; for a great run I have to say that I prefer a trail race... Added to the reasons above, there is also a slightly different focus on trail races, more being on completing and being 'at one' with nature, rather than the time it takes - within reason!!! Choosing my trail running gear for the day is the first task I complete... I generally do trail running starting in the morning so I often put my head out of the door to see what the weather holds for the day! Gear now chosen, breakfast... Don't have a particular food routine as some do... Just have what I fancy; either toast or breakfast cereal with a coffee made with milk... Hahaha, I say I don't have a 'routine' but then again I don't do cooked breakfast and I always have a milky coffee!!! Depending on the length and duration of the run, I think about the nutrition for the activity... Now I have a real difficulty with gels; they just make me feel sick during any race so they're off the menu! If it's a long run/race, I'll fill my hydration bladder with squash (full sugar version I'm afraid). A runner suggested putting it in the freezer overnight to chill but I've not been organised enough to try that yet! I also often take jelly sweets or fruit/nut mix with me. If it's a shorter local run, I'll just take some squash in a bottle and may be a nut bar or something similar - whatever I can find!  Having checked and double checked my gear, which includes a towel, waterproofs (sometimes) and full change of kit I'll set off to the run location. Generally I meet with other people. Having done the hello's, a quick stretch and off we go! If I'm doing a race, there is all the faffing around with number collection so I'll definitely leave much earlier to give me plenty of time. Again, if it's a race, I'll check my gear going with me several times, have a chat with fellow runners and wait for the start... I try to get some pre-race photos to record the event and the surroundings...  The race or run itself; what can I say, I take my mobile with me so that I can take photo's of the countryside and also the team or group of runners I'm with... All good for social media! I do try to think of a time I'd like to do a race in but unless I've done it before, there's little science in it without knowing the terrain! Only useful to think of post race refreshments!  Race done, I'm generally very hungry and thirsty (nutrition is always a challenge!) so I generally tuck into sugar free cola (or something stronger if I'm not driving!) and food... Many trail races have a good selection of home baked cakes that go down very well after a 26 mile slog! When I get home or in a group with any team mates doing the race, we generally chat about the challenge and the good (and challenging) parts of the course... I like to review the photos I've taken and get a post on social media pretty soon! As I'm located on the outskirts of London/edge of Kent we have a good local trail running scene... Within London itself, there are numerous parks and once you've searched them out it's great for a bit of countryside in the city... The Grand Union Canal and Regent Canals are little known but great for running along... Of course, the city type trails tend to be somewhat flatter and manicured but at least it's trails if you're in the city! For hills in London, there's Hampstead Heath which is a massive open landscape and there's also Primrose Hill and Parliament Hill...  Most locally to my location on the edge of Kent, there are lots of options including High Elms within 2 miles of my home, Lullingstone and Eynsford within 5 miles and North Downs Way, South Downs Way and Box Hill quite close by and also along the coasts near Margate for the sea views! In terms of running events, High Elms 10 K hosted by my club, North Downs Run, Hampshire Hoppit, Thames Meander, South Downs Marathon and Half Marathon, Beachy Head Marathon to mention just a few...  In terms of shop outlets, I am lucky in having a Nike outlet store less than a mile from me so all of my running attire needs are met with ease! I like Nike clothing but not so keen on their running shoes, although I've only run in one model of their shoes so perhaps a little swift of me to judge their footwear! Runner's Need is also near me although my local branch only has limited variety. I also shop online so sometimes will try a shoe and look online... Local trail running scene: I look to my local running club, Orpington Road Runners: https://www.facebook.com/groups/orpingtonroadrunners/ In London, I keep in touch with Advent Running: https://www.facebook.com/group... I particularly follow James Poole who is the supremo in Advent Running... A world class endurance athlete, very modest and a great bloke...  For general running in formation, I read 'Trail Running andRunners World. I find that social media keeps me well engaged! Here are the top three factors that I consider in selecting my trail running shoes: Flexible sole 
 Good grip - deep enough, retaining flexibility and not too heavy 
 Comfort with enough width 
 ""If a brand could only do a shoe with enough width with the neoprene foot liner, it would make my trail running shoes perfect..."" My first piece of advice would be not to go out and buy loads of running tops because you get loads from races you do! It doesn't matter if they are from road races as the fabric at starter level is all basically okay to get going with and if you do trail running, they'll get dirty anyway! I'd advise shoes with pretty flexible sole and reasonably deep grip, but not so much that it makes them either heavy or inflexible. Don't necessarily need to go with a particular brand as the fit is more important. My real deep grip shoes are really too heavy for any races but still okay for group runs. I'd also say, don't worry too much about the latest hydration pack to start with... If you can get something which is basically comfortable at a good price, that should be fine... My one I still use cost me £6 I think!",Blazer,
432098,Kamran,Mustafa ,kmustafa213@gmail.com,"Hi! My name is Kamran and I am a big fan of food in general and cheese specifically!   Whether cooking a meal for 9 at the firehouse, or enjoying a night out at a favorite restaurant, community has always been a big part of the enjoyment of food for me (and many others, I'm sure!).  Some of the best conversations and most relationship growth has occurred over meals and community will always be tied to my love of food.   More and more I'm bringing environmental considerations into the equation when making food decisions.  I'm now more willing and able to spend the extra time and money choosing foods that do less toward impacting the environment and that I can feel good about supporting.  This includes eating less meat and trying to by local.  One of my biggest food-related challenges is my attraction to sweets.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm addicted, but I can get a very strong sweet tooth...particularly when I'm tired.  This leads me to make bad dietary choices which I almost always regret later.  I've gotten better over the years, and I lead a very active lifestyle, but I still could greatly improve in that area. Bitchin' Sauce - 

It is an almond-based dip/spread.  It caught my eye because of it's ingredients and got me excited because I thought I may have found a suitable replacement for hummus.  When I was doing keto, hummus was mostly off the table because of the carb content.  Bitchin' Sauce really saved me at times in the absence of hummus, providing a delicious dip for veggies that kept me strict on my diet. My answer before directly relates to this.  I have very strong and nostalgic memories of eating cream cheese and bagels every morning that my friend's mom would drive us to school from Kindergarten to 6th grade.  It was always so sweet of her and delicious for me.  Takes me back to simple times like that! I would tell them that it's the perfect combination of texture, richness and creaminess (assuming they understood what those words meant!).  I would tell them that they could take whatever their favorite food was from their home-world, cover it in cream cheese, and that there would be a good chance it would be enhanced 10x.  I would also refrain from telling them where it came from until they tried it, cuz that might seem really odd and off-putting to them.  Pairing with the saltiness is the savory nature of cream cheese.  I think of it as an umami-like sensation (though I may be completely mis-using that term!) that my taste buds seek for satisfaction in food.    Spreads and mixes very easily.  Able to be conveniently measured using the hash marks on the foil-wrapped packing or the tubs.  You can scoop onto crackers straight out of the container.  As a snack or topping, it's just very easy to incorporate into your day/meal.  Philadelphia cream cheese coming out with a vegan variety was pretty interesting.  My partner is vegan, so it's nice when we can eat things together and it satisfy us both.  Hopefully it's good! Even when cream cheese has an acceptable ingredient list for me, there are still things in there that I would prefer not to be.  It may be that they are required to get and maintain the consistency and texture cream cheese that we all know and love, but I would be happy if they could be achieved in other ways.  Some of the things I'm referring to are stabilizers like carob bean gum and carrageenan.  I for one don't mind the calorie count or fat content that may bother some.  Making a breakfast sandwich! One specific occasion I'm recalling is when my girlfriend and I have epic movie days.  We pick a list of movies to watch, and end up doing that all day long (with the occasional break, of course).  In the morning, we go to the grocery store and get stuff for snacks and food during the day.  We almost always grab bagels, cream cheese and veggies to make breakfast sandwiches.  We toast them up, spread the cream cheese and slice up veggies to put on top.  This is just a fun, delicious and somewhat-healthy tradition we've developed and I always look forward to it.  I love throwing on that first movie then chowing down on these sandwiches that we just made.  The cream cheese plays a critical role in not only providing that delicious flavor, but also the binding agent to keep the veggies from sliding all around, as well as adding some moisture and texture change to the sandwich.  They have come a long way and I now see them as totally viable and inviting options when I'm at the store.  That wasn't always the case for me, but I'm glad that it now is.  My girlfriend is vegan, so these plant-based alternatives allow us to connect over food in ways we otherwise couldn't.  I also see the health benefits to finding plant-based alternatives to a variety of foods more than I once did, and that makes me feel good both from a sustainability/environmental perspective, as well as my own personal well-being. I would want to know that it was local (ish), was made with as whole of ingredients as possible and that there were no artificial ingredients added for the sake of appearance or preservation. I think it makes a lot of sense for them, since they have a very well-known brand name and people (I think) generally understand they create products to replace their dairy versions.  People would know what they were getting into and maybe the familiar name would make them feel it was more legitimate and worth their time to try.

I would certainly try it just to see how it was, though as stated in my previous answer, I think their large presence and well-known status works against them for me personally.",Bagel 2.0,

Food - the texture, the flavor, the accomplishment of something I made with my own hands is a pleasure to me and I enjoy savoring it.   Cooking and baking allows me to be creative- it is like creating art, for me.  My biggest frustration is the way we manufacture food in the USA. The government allows for many chemicals to be introduced into our food supply that other countries do not. It makes eating in healthy ways, difficult because the food supply isn't clean even when it purports to be. These are meals by a company called Real Eats. The meals are perfectly portioned and all the nutrition details help one make educated decisions about which meals to eat. The preparation is very simple- just boil the items in their bags for 6 minutes. The result is delicious, juicy food that tastes amazing. It excites me because it gives me a little break when I don't want to cook, but still want a healthy meal without getting something from a restaurant. I was at home with my mom in Brooklyn. She was toasting bread and we were about to have Temp-tee cream cheese as a topper. Although I love the texture of a firmer cream cheese (Philadelphia-style), the airy Temp-tee cream cheese was creamy, coated my mouth and complimented the bread perfectly. I was feeling happy. My mom worked very hard, so the times I got to spend with her were not always frequent, but we always enjoyed it, talking and laughing. She taught me so much. These moments are extra special since my mom is n o longer with us. I have many fond memories of us sharing meals together. I would say that cream cheese is light, yet filling and turns bread into a decadent treat. It also holds toppings together well. There are also so many flavors and varieties of cream cheese available, in case this alien is a vegan, or loves fruits and vegetables.  I have been eating cream cheese for most of my life and while I find many new ways to use it, there is also a familiarity and nostalgia that evokes happy memories.   Cream cheese can easily stand alone on breads, bagels and crackers, but also works great for layering fruit, veggies and smoked fish.  The Kite Hill cream cheese is the newest one I have tried. I tried plain and Chive. I was impressed with the flavor. The texture was a bit more like dip, in my opinion, but this did make it easier to spread on bread and bagels. It excited me, because I am always looking for ways to add more protein and less fat to my and my family's diets, but taste is key. I know Oat Milk is a hot item now- I would introduce more alternative ""mylk"" based cream cheeses to the world- more almond, more oat, different flavor additives.  Making a delicious cheesecake. I am in the kitchen, usually following a recipe I have found. I am usually alone.  I am hoping to make something delicious, rivaling a cake I would buy at Junior's. I will have the satisfaction of having made something delicious and decadent that I enjoy eating and something my family enjoys too. Cream Cheese is the staple of cheesecake- at least the ones I make. It is the most important part. I feel happy throughout - beginning, middle and end, knowing I will make something delicious, that didn't require buying it in a store. I could make this occasion even better with additional ingredients, such as different crusts and fruit toppings.  I like them. Flavors and textures have come a long way, so I integrate plant-based foods into my rotation on a regular basis. I would want to know about the flavors available- chives, scallion, fruit, vegetable, the flavor profile - how well does it measure up to dairy-based cream cheese, as far as flavor, and texture- how creamy and thick is this product related to the dairy cream cheese I am familiar with. I would like to hear input via reviews from others who have tried the product in the past. I think it's a great idea. They do milk and yogurt a lot of justice, and I think they would be great at cream cheese too. I would be very excited to try a cream cheese product from Almond Breeze because I have had great experiences with their other products and the list of attributes mentioned earlier excite me, too. I have a good opinion of plant-based cream cheese, so being that I like the brand Almond Breeze, this would help entice me to try this plant-based cream cheese even more.",Bagel 2.0,
379855,Abigail,Breslin,abbybres@yahoo.com,"My name is Abigail Breslin, and I’m a lover of spontaneity and hater of routine.   My number one approach is flavor. I can’t stand a bland meal. For example if I eat macaroni and cheese, it’s drizzled with sriracha. If I eat avocado toast, it’s covered in everything bagel seasoning. If I make brownies, it’s sprinkled with cayenne pepper. I love a punch!   I’ve never loved too much of one thing. I’m a HUGE fan of snacks, appetizers, tapas, etc. I would rather have tiny portions of several items than one big dish.  My biggest struggle is cooking/preparing food for myself. My boyfriend is gone for 12 hours for 4 days straight, so I’m often having to make myself meals. The only time I really enjoy cooking is with him because we have fun together. If it’s just me, I generally don’t feel as ambitious, plus cooking for one is much harder. When he’s at work I tend to eat super boring food. I bought this seasoning for the first time in December. As I mentioned, I love flavor and add-ons. I’ve always loved everything bagels, so this seasoning was calling out to me. I’d heard such great things. I’m loving it on my avocado toast! Oh, wow. Well, I’m sure I had cream cheese earlier than I can even recall, but one memory that sticks out is going to soccer camp as a kid and my mom packing me a potato bagel with cream cheese. It was SO delicious. I can almost taste it now just thinking about it (and this was probably 20 years ago.) I just love the consistency of the bagel with smooth cold cream cheese. Oh, hi Alien. There’s no need to eat me, because on this planet we have creamy delicious foods. One in particular is cream cheese. You see that black and white animal? It makes milk, which can be processed into the tastiest food. Cream cheese is delicious with round bread, which we call bagels. It also makes a luxurious dip for crunchy snacks. Your first bite is sure to make your eyes close and your mouth say “mmm.” Enjoy. Please don’t eat me.  I just love how spreading this on a bagel is a one and done meal.   My all-time favorite cream cheese is garden vegetable (on an everything bagel.) If I’m looking for something sweeter I’ll go for plain cream cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel. I love the variety of flavors there are to choose from.  Well, if I’m being honest I haven’t seen or heard anything new about cream cheese in a very long time! Perhaps it’s just not something I’m looking out for, but when I grab my cream cheese I don’t see anything new or exciting. I do know that there is a growing dairy-free section at the grocery that probably has one or two cream cheese variants. Perhaps the way in which you package it. I know the norm is a round container of sorts, but I do feel like when you keep putting your knife in there you get residue from your bagel or whatever it is you’re adding cream cheese to and that can affect the cream cheese and possibly speed up bacteria growth. The thing is, I think it could be kind of gross sounding to squeeze it out of a bottle or package (like peanut butter is now doing) because it makes it seem kind of child-like like GoGurt (ew!) Maybe there is a way to design it like that in a more appealing way, though.  Buffalo chicken dip: I very rarely make appetizers such as this, but it’s the perfect snack/meal for sporting events. The last time I made it was for the SuperBowl. The cream cheese is a vital ingredient in making this dish creamy and delicious, and takes some of the kick away from all the hot sauce! I only eat Philadelphia cream cheese, so I buy that in stick form for this recipe. I find it more fun to cook for events rather than everyday life, so while I enjoyed putting this together on game day, I wouldn’t necessarily go to the trouble on a regular basis.  I love the idea of them, and I think they have come a long way. Products are tasting more like food and less like cardboard. Although I’m not dairy-free or vegetarian, I have no problem at all eating plant-based alternatives because I know they’re loads healthier and that the options are getting better and better. I almost wish I could see the texture, but I realize that’s not really feasible unless they opt for a clear packaging. When I think plant-based or dairy-free, I tend to think the product will lose it’s texture. I prefer a thick and creamy cream cheese, so to see it’s similar would be a selling point for me.

431274,Paige,Mustafa,Paigemustafa@gmail.com,"Hi! I'm Paige, mama of two crazy kids, home chef extraordinaire and bad ass photographer.   The health of myself and my family drives what I cook. Don't get me wrong, we splurge and have an unhealthy meal here and there, but when I menu-plan for the week, my first priority is, ""Is this healthy AND tasty for my family?   I want something that packs a bold flavor and leaves you wanting more. I have no shame in admitting that I want people to talk about what I cooked for long after it's been eaten. I want to be remembered fondly when it comes to my cooking.  My biggest challenge would be my son Ari. For two reasons, he's allergic to dairy and he hates most meat. I don't tend to cook with a lot of dairy, but there's some staple and favorite meals in our house that I end up cooking a separate meal for him because I can't figure out how to cook it sans dairy. Meat is another difficult one. He hasn't figured out how to enjoy a lot of vegetables either, so finding something sufficient and filling that is also healthy for him, has been difficult. Beyond Burgers, FOR SURE! I had been hearing a lot of hype on it, and honestly, I didn't buy into it very much. I'm a vegetarian, and most times, I don't miss meat, however, I miss the HECK out of burgers. I've tried so many different vegan/vegetarian burgers and they just didn't do the trick. I'm not a fan of the black bean patties, the morning star grillers are OK, but none have really been able to get the flavor or consistency right. 

When I finally gave Beyond Burgers a go, oh man, it was a flavor explosion in my mouth! I couldn't believe they were able to get actual meat texture right AND get the burger to hold up on the grill. That's another big one for me.. I love to grill, and the other vegan/veggie options out there just don't hold up well.. They either fall apart or stick to the grill. Beyond Burgers crush it. Every time! The King Dip -- AKA the secret family recipe I mentioned before. 

I can't really remember how old I was, but I was at a family BBQ and my dad was always the one who brought the dip. It looked disgusting.. Almost like a pink vomit, but everyone was going for it, loading their plates up, spreading it on their burgers. I just didn't get it. And then I tried it.. Holy hell. This is the holy grail. My families best contribution to the world. I begged him to take home the left overs, which he laughed and said there won't be... (and there wasn't).

I remember when I brought my first boyfriend home.. We served the dip. My dad had prepped me beforehand and said ""he can't be a king, or in the family if he doesn't like the dip. It's just the rules."" Basically, it was our way of testing people. 

He didn't like the dip. We ended in divorce. Coincidence? I think not. OK.. Picture this. It's soft, like margarin but creamy like goat cheese. The taste is like an oasis that hits your tongue and transports you to a little farm. It's the perfect addition to any meal. Salami? Add cream cheese. Bagel? Cream cheese. Dessert? CREAM CHEESE CAKE!!!!!!!!!!!  As much as it pains me to say, I know that every time I take a bite of something with cream cheese, I'm not being healthy. I know that it's got oodles of calories and saturated fats.   To go with the above -- I know it's unhealthy, but it's something I'm willing to sin for, because it's that delicious.  The Whipped Cream Cheese. I don't know if this is considered ""new"" but, to me it is. It was exciting to me, because for one, it was offered by the brand I know and trust, and two, the thought of an even softer, and fluffy cream cheese blew my mind. Make it more healthy. I would eat it all day every day, if I didn't fear what it was doing to my waistline and heart. That's what excites me about this study in general, to me, when I think vegan, I think healthy. If you can make a product that tastes just as good, while being even just a tad bit healthier, you can take alllll my money.  Family Get Togethers/BBQs -- The ""King Dip"" 
We're at either my dad's house, or my Aunt Anne and Uncle Steve's. We're sitting outside either by their pool, or in my dad's backyard under his gazebo. We're talking about old stories of Grandma King or the crazy trouble my dad used to get into as a kid/teen. Cream cheese is important, because it's the staple of our dip. It's honestly the glue of it. As we're all going around telling stories and laughing way too hard, we're piling on dip on our plates with the Original Ruffles. In between sentences, we're pausing for a little try of it. It's in the middle of all of us, we gather around it. Whenever someone walks in, who was in charge of making it, everyone goes ""IS THAT THE DIP?"" Ah man, this is making me want to cry! After spending time with my family like this, I feel connected, at ease, my endorphins feel heightened, and I feel proud to be apart of this circle.  It's only been recently that I've added plant-based foods into my diet. Honestly, prior to adding them, I definitely felt some type of way about them. I feel like they have this stigma, which is hard to break through. The first plant-based food I tried was veggie burgers -- the morning star brand. That really helped change the way I thought about plant-based foods and opened me up to trying new things.

Now, I use meat alternatives all the time. I use vegan hot dogs, chicken, burgers, etc. I've dabbled into vegan cheese and honestly, haven't been too impressed yet. I'd want to know that it has the same, great taste as the leading competitor, and that i'm not sacrificing fat, for taste.. If that makes sense. I'd want to know what the source of fat, is, and the flavor of the product I'm selecting. It'd be awesome too, if the packaging could lead you to a website with a list of recipes to use this new cream cheese replacement in! I think it makes sense. I mean, they've been in the almond milk game for forever, so it's about time to launch something new. Blue Diamond being the name behind the cream cheese definitely would change my opinion a bit. With it being such a big, and well-known household name, it carries some weight with it. My expectations would definitely be higher.",Bagel 2.0,
431275,Marion,Delgiudice,paxpig@hotmail.com,"I am a nurturer who loves to create art with different materials, cook with traditional healthful ingredients and spend time with my amazing family and friends (especially when I’m helping them rehab baby squirrels).   Life is short, so we need to enjoy every moment. Why waste time eating something awful and boring?   Stewardship of our bodies is our responsibility. Filling ourselves with chemicals, sugar and salt is counterproductive. I am even more aware of this as I age and try to make up for bad eating habits in the past. My biggest issues are high cholesterol (even as as vegan!) and living with one kidney. I donated my “spare” several years ago and try to avoid overly processed food.  While I am committed to veganism, my husband, other family and friends are not. The challenge is coming up with creative and delicious recipes that we’ll all enjoy. Sometimes this means that I cook the vegan part of the meal and husband cooks the non-vegan part. In addition, most vegan recipes are labor intensive, so convenience usually takes a back seat. That means I can’t just whip up a fast and fabulous meal. Going out to dinner is also challenging and frustrating. It has improved but restaurants don’t always understand that vegan isn’t the same as vegetarian! Just Egg. Finally I could have an “omelet” that wasn’t a tofu scramble! The texture and taste are close to real eggs without the cruelty.  The picture on the box is appetizing to me. “Made from plants not chickens” makes me feel good. The ingredients are fairly healthy. Finally the product is convenient . The only downside is its limited availability. The bottled product has a rather short shelf life. That’s a problem because I rarely can use the whole thing before it spoils. Cream cheese was a comfort food in our house. I remember my mom spreading a thick layer of “Philly” on a toasted bagel, English muffin or raisin bread for my breakfast. I’d watch the cream cheese melt and that first bite was heaven! But it wasn’t only a breakfast food. Miraculously it could give peanut butter a run for its money. I remember eating a cold cream cheese and jelly sandwich in the summer. Unlike the gooey warm texture of breakfast cream cheese, cold cream cheese was like a slice of ice cream. Solid and almost chilling. My cream cheese memories are endless! Your teeth (?) or eating appendages will sink through a smooth and silky layer that is a perfect balance of tart and sweet. It will make almost any food taste fuller and more satisfying. Remarkably it has the most important substances that protect your outer surface from the sun’s damaging rays and keeps your internal structure from collapsing.  I can think of so many ways to use it from breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and hors d’ oeuvres. If I need to whip something up for unexpected guests, it is my go to product always in the refrigerator.   CC is the ultimate comfort food. It reminds me of childhood. It can be a rich and tasty indulgence without the guilt.  KiteHill is an almond milk cc and that’s exciting because I’m not thrilled with eating so many soy based products.  I’m looking forward to trying this one. Make a vegan version that has all the properties of the “real” thing! I’d love to have an alternative that is healthful, tasty and priced well. If it could be used in different ways that would be awesome.  I ‘ve been making my famous cream cheese sugar cookies for every holiday for over 40 years. When I was first married, my mother-in-law gave me a booklet of holiday. Adding some “Philly” to the dough gave it a richness of flavor and helped it roll out smoothly.   My three children would settle around our kitchen table while I took out the hand mixer. My oldest son started  calling it his “old friend”. I guess when you’re five, a mixer is like a cherished friend who comes to visit during special times to make memories. The mixer signaled that a holiday was coming. The kids helped me measure the ingredients and mix the dough. James adored cream cheese and had to have a taste before it went into the bowl. Picking out the cookie cutters, icing colors and decorations were part of the process and my kids would negotiate who would get the favorite shape first. Christmas trees, Easter eggs, maple leaves, shamrocks, ghosts... these marked the seasons. And then there were the “just because” cream cheese sugar cookies. Snow days, sniffles, disappointments were made better when I took out the block of Philly and the mixer. Now that my three are grown with homes of their own and partners, they still look for those cookies when they come for the holidays. Although I won’t eat the cookies now ( being vegan)  I still make them for my family. There’s a block of Philly just waiting in my frig!  I am a vegan so I depend on plant based foods. Some have been delicious and others are disappointing. I m always buying new products, trying them and many times tossing them out. My family looks for non plant based foods so I cook separately for them. It must be vegan/cruelty free. Also, I would like it to be lower calorie Excellent idea! I depend on the brand for great quality and value. Also like the idea that it would be nut based vs soy. I consume enough tofu and edamame so I don’t need it in my spreads. I’ve been looking for a cream cheese alternative that wouldn’t have the gritty, dry texture I ve found with soy products.",Bagel 2.0,

I am a tantrum tamer, lullaby singer, screen time negotiator, problem solver, ex-advertising professional and a current full time mom.   I believe that the food I make is an expression of my love for my family. Food is fuel for our body and it is extremely important that good quality fuel goes in for the body to function well. Our meals are home-cooked from scratch (except for spice powders) about 99% of the time, with fresh ingredients. Yes, it takes up quite a bit of my time but this is not something that I will compromise about. The other advantage of home cooked food is better control over what goes in - we do not eat eggs or any meat, my husband is allergic to a few ingredients, we are particular about vegetarian cheese- home cooking helps me ensure these things.   Traditional Indian cooking is very time consuming. Given that most of my time goes on remote school and running behind a kid, I have started using some pre-preps and shortcuts to make cooking easier while at the same time, not giving up on the nutrition value. I chop all vegetables needed for a couple of days in a row. I use one pot, one shot methods to reduce cooking time and the Instant Pot where I do not have to babysit the equipment. The cool thing with Instant Pot is that I can time the cooking to start to coincide with when we come home, so food is ready to eat when we walk in. Cooking healthy is important but cooking smart sure helps too!  I think the biggest frustration is the actual cooking bit. When something becomes routine and monotonous, you lose your zest for it and it gets boring. I do enjoy cooking and I find it stimulating and therapeutic but not when I have to cook in a rush - which is almost everyday! There was a time when I used to romance cooking - inhaling the flavors, watching the blend of colors and textures, tasting it indulgently, garnishing like a restaurant dish and taking my time to choose serving dishes. Now, it is important for me to get my lunches and dinners ready on time - so I can get my kid ready for the afternoon school sessions and then for bedtime after dinner. Plus I get super hungry by lunch or dinner time! This situation is even more exacerbated now that I have a fractured toe so my mobility is a bit limited.  

Over the past few weeks, I've tried to mitigate this issue by prepping for the week - making a weekly menu, chopping veggies for the week, making the base sauces for the week, etc. While I always try to whip up something for my son's dinner, we have become a bit lax about ours, especially since the fracture. About twice a week, we have ended up eating frozen food like paranthas, burgers or ravioli - which to me is still better than eating out at a restaurant. Even in these cases, I try to for organic frozen food or something with very few, healthy ingredients like plant based burgers or organic spinach mozzarella ravioli. I am not sure if this is a new food product, but I recently came across organic beetroot powder. I was actually on the search for something natural to use as a food color when I chanced upon this. When I read further on this, the fact that it was high in anti-oxidants and minerals and increases stamina and metabolism checked more boxes. I always knew beets are a superfood (we have it at least once a week) but the powder makes it easier to include it on a daily basis and that got me excited. Okay, so I've been having cream cheese for soooo long now that I don't remember the exact details but I'll try my best!

I think it was in April 2014. I had just moved to the US (to Delaware) the previous month after spending all my life in India. My husband had meetings in New Jersey and I decided to tour NYC on my own, considering how much he 'loves' museums! I had just finished going around The Met and I headed to the cafe for a bite. Now, I am vegetarian so I couldn't eat more than half of the items on the menu. I was actually feeling rather out of place, because it seemed a very posh place and there were many well dressed people around and there I was, in jeans and a tee, disheveled from walking around the museum and the city!!!

That was enough for me to skip any fancy item and go for a bagel and coffee. Those croissants were served with cream cheese and that was the first time I ever tasted cream cheese (or a bagel!)! I remember slathering the cheese rather generously on my bagel and I remember liking the cheese so much! It tasted so different from all the regular cheese, quite like an 'un-cheese'. So much that the next day I went out to my local supermarket and bought cream cheese. At that time, it was a taste explosion that I still remember (I also remember not liking bagels!) Cream cheese is incredibly creamy, smooth and the best cheese on Earth. Eating cream cheese will make you a joyous human and you will never want to go back to wherever you came from!  Cream cheese is a very well balanced meshing of tastes - sweet, salt, tang, smooth...you know the sense of contentment that comes from eating something yummy? To me, cream cheese does that. That moment when it melts in your mouth and the flavors come to life - bliss.   While it is yummy and delightful, it packs in quite a calorie punch. It's not something that can be eaten everyday because it is very high in saturated fats as well as cholestrol  I guess I'll have to say plant based cream cheese. I am not vegan or plant based but to me, plant based cream cheese represented a healthier cheese with more vitamins as against 'empty' dairy cheese. And I thought I could reduce the guilt that came with eating (more like gobbling) cream cheese. Two things - one is wishful thinking - that cream cheese can have lower calories and fats without compromising on taste.

Second is the packaging - in all the brands that I buy, the mechanism to store left over cheese is really bad. We do not use the full 8oz block in one go. Right now, I am just wrapping the leftover cheese in the foil pack and saving it. Maybe if there was a tub or a seal mechanism, left over cheese can stay fresh for longer.  Making cream cheese frosting For my birthday last year, since we were under lockdown, a couple of friends cooked birthday lunch for me. As a thank you, I had made chocolate cake for them. For the frosting, I went with cream cheese frosting with sprinkles on top. I had made the cake the night before and I made the frosting in the morning. I love making frosting! Especially when I get to eat spoonfuls of it under the pretext of tasting! I could have given a store bought gift or pastry but I feel that a hand made treat conveys more affection. Buttercream frosting is a bit too sweet and greasy and I never get whipped cream right, so to be on the safer side, I decided to go with cream cheese frosting. I was on cloud nine when the frosting turned out perfect - light and not too sweet and spreads really well. I was even happier that I could give a perfect cake to my friends. In hindsight, I should have added some color to the frosting to make it more colorful and festive. My dream is to bake cheesecake at home one day but it looks too complicated and I don't have the confidence to pull it off!  Being a life long vegetarian but not vegan, a plant based lifestyle to me is aspirational but not realistic. There is no denying that plant based foods are high up there on the health spectrum. In our Indian culture, we grew up drinking milk and cooking with oil and having sugar and each of these food items had a reason - oil to lubricate the joints, dairy for protein and Vitamin A, etc. It's not that plant based living deprives one of nutrients - I've seen toddlers thriving on a plant based lifestyle and I am also part of a group where I can see transformational results before me. For me, given that this is what me and my siblings grew up on, and with some of these mentioned in our ancient texts, it is difficult for me to give up and I would like to pass this along to my kid.

Some PB foods like maple syrup, agave, etc. are easier to give up but relinquishing dairy - milk, yogurt, cheese, paneer, etc is quite difficult for me. 1) We do not eat mushrooms and my husband is allergic to cucumbers and zucchini, so I'd make sure none of those are present
2) A near equal price point. It is often felt that plant based products are usually more pricey and are not affordable to all
3) Less number of chemical sounding ingredients and / or an explanation of the purpose of these ingredients
4) I'd look for an almond based cream cheese rather than cashews. Cashews are the tastier nut but are more fatty ",Bagel 2.0,

Rather than going to food mainly for pleasure, look first to what it's giving your body and mind. Then choose what you need, and decline what you don't, to give your body the optimal (or at least a defensibly sound) mix of what it needs to perform at its best.   There's no need for another creature to suffer for me to sustain myself at very high levels. Nor do I need to ravage the environment.  My biggest challenge is that I tend to overeat. I also find it difficult to know how to maintain a mostly vegetarian diet while getting the whole sweep of correct nutrition. As a result, I tend to be lazy about this, and end up eating far too much processed food. I know from personal experience that you can follow a fully vegan diet and still eat poorly. Probably the Beyond Meat sausage. Excited because it was vegan and, from advance press, the pea-based protein was supposed to be very nutritious --- and the whole product to be very much like real meat. And it indeed turned out to be probably the best fake meat I've come across in years. The packaging (which mimicked the usual approach to sausage) didn't hurt, I'll admit.

Similarly, impossible-meat everything coming to, you name it: A vegan burger joint, the neighborhood Mexican place, etc. For much the same reasons.

The one down the road that _really_ has my interest --- and which we've been waiting on for years --- is lab-grown meat. Real meat, zero suffering. Bring the Frankenburger! (Franken-cheesesteak . . . mmmmmm . . . .) I genuinely do not recall. I have recourse, again, only to the general memory of always having bagels with cream cheese growing up. They're the sort of thing pretty much everyone loves, like pizza, so it's also tied in with communal meals. Or breakfasts grabbed on the run, which implies all the activities one might have been running to: Work, school, ball game (when you're a kid, of course, you can wolf down a meal _before_ playing 90 minutes of soccer or what have you). It's a smooth and comforting blanket for your stomach that makes everything around it all the more enjoyable --- and innately delivers generations' worth of cultural understanding. Grok cream cheese and you've grokked a big chunk of American pop history.  Brings to mind breakfasts with friends or snacks caught on the go. And childhood.   You pretty much always know exactly what you're getting.  I don't think that I've seen anything new and exciting in this area recently. My wife introduced me to Miyoko products a few years back and they've become a go-to. Though mainly for ""butter."" It would be better if it were healthier. Lower-calorie, maybe, fully organic, less fat. Flavored options are always welcome; especially, again, where care is taken in the ingredients, so that you don't end up with a Febreze of cream cheese, if you get my point.  Would have been getting a bagel (the type varied) before sitting down to read the )old-school) newspaper with coffee during undergrad and grad school. The whole routine being pure enjoyment. Always felt settled and focused afterward, de-stressed, and ready to move on with other tasks.
  They do fit into my lifestyle. I choose them overwhelmingly. The only carnivorous (broadly speaking) items left in my diet are seafood, humanely produced eggs, and cheeses. Both of the latter being pretty occasional. Mostly, plant-based products are great. They leave little to be desired. The fake meats have come a long way --- though they're still highly processed. Basically, plant-based foods are the better choice for health and for ethical reasons. And they really don't leave you missing anything that can't easily be missed. Well, the gluten-free thing would be helpful. Not for me, but for my wife. I would want to know if it's fully organic. The absence of artificial trans fats. Limited ingredients is a preferred virtue where it's available among a group of possible choices. I would definitely try an Almond Breeze cream cheese! It probably does. Presumably a Blue Diamond product would be both of good quality, flavor, and texture, without being quite as laughably expensive as Miyoko's. And I don't really know of any other competitor. Could use some options in this area.

Their experience raising almonds probably matters. The best vegan cheeses I've had have probably been made from cashews . . . so almonds definitely suggest themselves as a possible contender.",Bagel 2.0,

I think flavor is the absolute most important thing when it comes to food. If someone gave me the choice between well seasoned cardboard or a completely bland strip of boiled chicken, I'd rather eat the tasty cardboard. I don't really mind much if it's a natural or artificial flavor, if it's healthy or unhealthy, as long as it tastes good. Ideally, things would be naturally flavored, healthy, and ethically sourced, but flavor is really the main determining factor on whether I'll buy something or not.    How do I feel after eating it? Satisfied and satiated? Dehydrated and bloated, like there was too much salt? Groggy and uncomfortable, like after eating too much junk food? I don't much care for food that sits in your stomach like a bag of bricks and makes you feel heavy and like you need to go sleep it off. I like for my food to fill me up without making me feel sick or queasy, or cause any other kind of gastrointestinal distress.  I really get frustrated by false advertising. For example, if something says it's going to be spicy, and then it just absolutely is not spicy at all, I feel like I have wasted my money and time on a product. I enjoy trying different flavors of things, but can be very disappointed when things miss the mark and don't taste like what they claim to be flavored after.  I love the impossible burger because it is able to really tactfully mimic the taste and texture of a real burger, and because of this I could never eat another meat based burger again and be perfectly happy. But when trying a seitan bbq pulled pork dish, it tasted more like sauce covered tissue paper than food, so I probably wont be getting that ever again. I don't mind brands taking risks with new products or flavors or substitutes, I just get frustrated when it seems like no effort was made to actually execute the intended end product. If pizza Pringles were just mildly cheesey flavored chips, no one would buy them. The last time I got really excited for a new food product, I was on a simple milk run at the local grocery store when I saw Jeni's Special Ice Creams in the freezer section on my way out of the store. I locked eyes with the Skillet Cinnamon roll ice cream, made with a cream cheese based ice cream with cinnamon and brown sugar caramel swirls and little pieces of pastry sprinkled in. It was $12 for a pint of ice cream, but I bought it and I would buy it again in a heartbeat because I was so pleasantly surprised by how well it captured the flavor of a cinnamon roll. This was hands down the best little sweet treat I've gotten for myself in a good long while. One of my earliest memories of cream cheese was my mom buying us Sam's club cinnamon raisin bagels and a tub of Philadelphia cream cheese and making us bagels one day. I remember thinking it was basically a better cupcake and asked for bagels and cream cheese at my next birthday party because I never really liked cake. Imagine my delight when my mother then made a cheesecake for my birthday instead, and that became a long standing tradition for us that we still do nearly 20 years later. I think we would first have to go over some sweet things, and introduce an alien to frosting and icing, and then tell them guess what, we have ""frosting"" for savory food too, it's called cream cheese!  I also think creamy because I love bagels and find that the dry bready crumble pairs so beautifully with a smooth, rich layer of cream cheese.   Again, I love how cream cheese can transition so beautifully based on what it is paired with. On a sesame bagel or on a pierogi, perfect savory addition of cream. On a carrot cake or making up an entire cheese cake, perrrrfffect sweet treat. It does it all!  I love the addition of toppings in cream cheese. Any good deli/bodega worth its bagel salt in NYC will had massive tubs of cream cheese with really scallion and strawberries, walnuts and raisin and cinnamon, etc. I love a topping or a mix-in! it would be amazing if cream cheese was slightly healthier and better for me, considering how much of it I eat!  When my mom makes me a cheese cake on my birthday each year!  I love trying plant based alternatives in an attempt to cut down on my animal product consumption and find healthier alternatives.  If there were a cream cheese alternative out there that still got me the same taste and texture, then I would 100% be interested in trying in. The problem is I have yet to try a plant based cream cheese that seems like it is even trying to replicate the taste of cream cheese I would like some claim about the flavor being comparable to the non-vegan alternative, and I would like to know that that claim is true and not just marketing. I want to buy a substitute for cream cheese, so I want it to actually mimic the taste of cream cheese. ",Bagel 2.0,ESFP
396607,Kathleen,Bedrick,kat98311@gmail.com,"Hi I am Kathleen from Philadelphia, I live with my spouse and our dog and I am a Client Manager for a Non-Profit.   I look for new experiences. I like trying new types of food, new flavors, cooking new recipes.   I like variety. I want to see what's available at the store, what is new, and prefer to shop myself rather than do grocery delivery.  My biggest challenge with food is that I like pretty much everything, all types of food, all cuisines. I don't like being restricted. I have an endless appetite and think about food 24/7. It's a challenge because while I have no qualms about eating healthy foods, I also like indulgent food as well. It can be a inner battle sometimes for what I know is the healthier option versus what I looks like it would taste better. I am always trying to balance or just opt for what leans more towards the healthier option. Veggie and meat products made by Misfit Foods. It caught my eye because they are ~50% veggie and ~50% humanly raised meat. Products I've seen are one or the other, 100% alternative meat or 100% humanly raised traditional animal meat. It was interesting to see a product that blended the two concepts. It got me intrigued because I've had alternative meat products and I do eat them but not all the time. My spouse would never eat them on a consist basis, they are are 100% carnivore. But the Misfit foods product I think bridges a gap and makes the concept more approachable. They also have fun, interesting flavors that appeal to me because they are unique and seem thoughtful and foodie like. I was eating a bagel with cream cheese. I was enjoying the creaminess and slight faint tangy taste. It was special because cream cheese is not like butter. You don't need to melt into your toasted bagel, if your bagel is too warm it absorbs the cream cheese a bit. But it always spreads easily unlike butter on the bagel. It is soft, spreadable, mild tasting and made from milk and cream. If they've ever had freshly made cheese it has a somewhat similar taste. Cream cheese has a faintly tangy taste as well. It's a very a universal product. It's good on toasted bread products for breakfast or on vegetables as snacks, to make sauces creamy, to make dips, add sugar to it for baking, there are a lot of uses for it.  It can be used in so many ways. It goes beyond just using it on a bagel. The sweet and savory applications are infinite.    I always see cream cheese as the universal product that can be used for most diets. It's low carb, low sugar, the fat content is considered acceptable.  The various vegan cream cheeses. There are dairy free alternatives and some actually can be used for baking and cooking. The fact that some can be used for cooking and baking was the most intriguing part as well as the fact that they actually taste good - according to the reviews I read. The packaging with cream cheese is an area that could definitely be improved upon. The foil packaging is a bit frustrating, when you want to reseal it, you have a lot of issues with the cleanliness, it's also not the most sturdy. But I always feel like the cream cheese stays the most fresh in the foil packaging vs. the plastic tubs. But neither seems particularly eco friendly. The foil packages do make it much easier though to know how much you are using when utilizing the cream cheese for cooking or baking because of the measurements on the outside of the packaging. If there was a happy medium between the convenience of the plastic tub but the freshness of the foil that would be ideal.  Holidays, get togethers with family and/or friends and making desserts. I am at home in my own kitchen, I like to make desserts often the day before. I am usually by myself. Or my spouse is in the other room, and on standby to clean dishes - all the items that have to be hand washed. I am hoping to achieve a great tasting dessert. Also I like to feel better prepared and that's why I usually do my desserts a day ahead of time. At the start of the process I don't have the end product, which is the dessert. A dessert that I am proud of and that my family and/or friends will like.  
 Cream cheese is important because it balances out the sweetness, it adds creaminess, it brings a subtle tang to the overall dessert and it adds to the texture of whatever I am baking.  
 Before I am feeling prepared, during I am focused because I don't want to make a mistake and waste or have to start over. After I am usually happy, assuming my recipe turned out as planned.  I could make the occasion even better if perhaps getting the larger sizes of cream cheese were easier when needing larger quantities of cream cheese. The 48 oz block of cream cheese isn't very easy to find at the store. But it is more ideal for baking if you need more than 1 or 2 bricks of cream cheese.  I think they bring value. They decrease our dependency on animal protein, they are healthier for you and it's more eco-friendly. I eat plant based protein intermittently but not consistently. How it can be used, how it tastes, the texture, shelf life and how it compares to regular cream cheese. It makes sense if they entered the cream cheese category. They are in other plant based dairy categories. I'd be interested to see how the texture is. I do think it may be a bit expensive at first. Most of the plant based cream cheeses are quite pricey. The brand brings a fan based following and a reputation. So I would be more willing I think to try the plant based cream cheese than perhaps from other brands. But that could be because I like other Almond Breeze products. The brand also brings a history. The brand has tradition and experience for cultivating almonds. Not necessarily for making cream cheese but it does help that the brand has already established themselves well in the plant based dairy category.",Bagel 2.0,
198777,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"I am a writer working in kids' entertainment, a husband and a dad.   I see food as a reward, not just fuel. So that means I'm always seeking to curate my life in such a way that all of my meals are as delicious as possible.   I'm such a big fan of chefs who aspire to raise the level of their work to art.  I'm a decent cook, but I wish I were a little better. If I were a little faster and more technically proficient, I may be a bit more experimental with the meals I cook for my family. It was a half-loaf of Tartine Bakery Oat Porridge bread.
It caught my eye at Whole Foods because the bread inside the package was an amazingly beautiful specimen. 
I was excited because I know Tartine by my visits while in San Francisco and because of its reputation as one of the foremost bakeries on the west coast. When I was growing up in Colorado, my parents were huge bagel fans because they had met and lived together in New York (which is where I was born). So, when I was about five, they were ecstatic when a new restaurant called Bagel Nosh opened in our small town. My dad introduced me to cream cheese by spreading it on Bagel Nosh bagels, and per the New York requirement, spread it in large quantities. I remember loving it immediately, and in addition to the taste of the cream cheese, I think I remember the occasion because it was a passionate food moment I shared with my parents. There's this food we have. It's like a paste, but it's fatty and creamy. The mouthfeel is just short of weird, but it tiptoes that line with finesse.  Cream cheese is a little like butter's classier cousin -- a little lighter, a little easier to deal with (spread).   The creamy part is right in the name, of course, but when you want something that feels a little more exciting than butter, but not as heavy as a slice of cheese...  I know that we're moving toward the world of plant-based cream cheese in this project, but as someone who has flirted with being vegan in the past, the inclusion of plant-based cream cheeses is honestly the most exciting thing I've seen in that world. I like that there are more options, because more options means that the texture has to get better (always my sticking point with previous plant-based cream cheeses). Cream cheese is delicious and decadent. I don't eat it everyday because I know it has a high fat (and calorie) content relative to other options, so if I was to change anything about it, I'd make a delicious, low-fat version.  My favorite time to eat cream cheese is weekend breakfasts. Today is a great example, because I pre-ordered a dozen bagels to pick up this morning, made a special trip and collected them, then returned home to prepare an assortment for my wife and little girl. My daughter likes her plain bagels slathered in cream cheese (which I have to remind her not to lick off without eating the bagels -- as if the bagels are nutritious in any way), and my wife and I like everything bagels with the whipped cream cheese we have in the house at the moment. When I was out getting bagels, my wife made some pour-over coffee. Once I return, I prepare the bagels and we all sit together with our bagels and cream cheese and coffee at the dining room table. My daughter watches cartoons while my wife and I read our favorite sections of the newspaper.  We don't really have much free time in the mornings during the week, so a slow breakfast like this is a treasured time together, and cream cheese really adds to the idea that it's a special treat. Bagels don't really feel like they're complete unless they have cream cheese.  I love plant-based foods! I spent the better part of a year as a vegan (almost ten years ago now), but definitely go through phases where I feel some sort of biological and ecological imperative to drastically cut down on my consumption of animal and animal-derived products. I eat a lot of plant-based meats, in particular, as well as soy and nut milks. There is always a future I imagine for myself where I'm solely plant-based, but mostly, I'm a mindful eater who skews very vegetarian. Can I count on any protein content? Does it contain any GMO? Any artificial flavors or colors? ",Bagel 2.0,
304824,Michelle,McManus,michellesmcmanus@gmail.com,"I'm Michelle and I'm a dog-loving, yoga-doing, coffee-drinking, vegan-gluten-free, marketing and business operations wizard!   I do my best to always choose foods that are clean, organic, local, and/or include ingredients that I can pronounce. After years of GI and skin-related issues, I realized that what I fed my body greatly affected the way I felt overall. I noticed changes in mood, digestion, and alertness when I eliminated problematic foods (ie: dairy -- turns out I'm lactose intolerant, gluten, wheat, flour, and overly processed items like tofu). If I don't eat clean, I suffer. Quality of life is just not something I'm willing to sacrifice, so eating clean has become a major priority.   Food is meant to taste great. I don't know why anyone would want to waste caloric intake on something that isn't scrumptious!! I have found that the fresher the goods (ie: shopping at my local farm stand) the better the taste. I used to *hate* tomatoes, and now I love them, because I now know what a real, homegrown, local, organic, in-season tomato tastes like.  Also, similar thread, I hate when food has a bunch of unnecessary additives. ie: random preservatives that I have no idea how to pronounce or what they even do, sugar -- mostly it's in major excess, etc.  I think the biggest challenge I face is that within my limitations, I am limited on what brands/options I have to choose from. I basically cycle through the same 5 products on a weekly basis, and it can get a little boring at times. The industry is definitely picking up, though, and I have noticed so many new, innovative products in the natural/organic/vegan/gluten-free category. Your Super. I was referred to this brand through a colleague after sharing about some of the most recent skin/GI issues I've been having. She recommended I get on the detox and immune system support regiments, and I'm so happy I did.

I love the packaging, product transparency, and community support that came along with ordering Your Super. 

I've been using it on and off for a few weeks and have definitely noticed a positive return in some of the products (ie: I LOVE Magic Mushroom, Super Green, Forever Beautiful). I take a turmeric/black pepper supplement and feel like I have gotten better results with that than the Golden Mellow product. I'm super excited to try their Plant Collagen product next, as well as their energy/superfood bars.

This product line was extremely easy to integrate into my existing diet, and gave me the extra boost I was looking for. It's helped me better manage my skin, and has made a noticeable change in my digestive system. Ha! I distinctly remember being in our kitchen, sitting at the island, and crunching down into a toasted bagel with a thick layer of plain cream cheese and realizing that I was eating the most scrumptious thing *ever.* I remember the cheese being a bit sticky and all up in my teeth, but not caring one bit because it was so delicious.

My parents are European, and I'm pretty sure that the only reason why we had cream cheese was because my older brother had it at a friends house and requested we have (loads) of it at home as well. 

Interestingly, when I think back to my cream cheese memory, it makes me think of really heart warming, happy moments with my family. My brother and I don't really get along, but food is something we always align on. Cream cheese and costco bagels were a big hit in our house, and we would sit down together and chow down any day of the week -- didn't matter what we had going on, there was always time for a bagel and cream cheese. Ha!

Cream cheese is a magical, savory spread that is traditionally put on top of something crunchy, like a bagel. Most cream cheeses are mild in taste, but provide an extra layer of creamy delight that 100% enhances the bagel-eating (or whatever crunchy item you're eating) experience. People like cream cheese because it's more substantial than butter, has a more specific/savory taste, and is likely tied to their childhood up-bringing.  When I think about how one spreads cream cheese, I am called to comment on how thick/spreadable it is. It's thicker than butter, more condense than yogurt, but not as hard as cheese (like cheddar or swiss).   Cream cheese adds a punch to whatever you're snacking on. Most of the time cream cheese is a savory addition.  I heard that Philadelphia cream cheese (owned by Kraft Heinz) is in the R&D phase of implementing a vegan cream cheese. Generally speaking, I would not be interested in trying out this product, but because I have such strong memories of Philadelphia cream cheese as a kid, I would totally buy this to try it out. :) The cream cheese alternatives I use all come in a very useful plastic container with a detachable lid. I love this format, over the cardboard box + foil wrapped block, however I'm becoming more and more conscious about using/purchasing single-use plastics. It would be great if there was a biodegradable option that functioned as well as the plastic packaging options!  I LOVE a bagel and cream cheese. I think this is my ultimate favorite way to consume cream cheese. I'm going to take you on a journey through a morning with a bagel, cream cheese, and.... a hot coffee :)  It's a Saturday, and it's been one hell of a week. My dogs have let me sleep in an extra 30 minutes (thanks girls ;) ) and I've just walked in the door from their morning walk. It takes me .2035 seconds to remember I have a bagel in the freezer, waiting for this EXACT moment. I set the girls up with breakfast and get to work. I am determined to get this bagel defrosted to it's perfect pre-frozen stage, and pop that bad boy in the toaster oven. By now I'm ""starving"" (not really, but you get what I mean) and every ounce of my effort is focused on my bagel and coffee. I'm a multitasker, so while I'm defrosting I'm also on a mission to get water heated, beans ground, and french press ready for brewing. I pivot back to my bagel, slice it in half. I'm giddy with excitement. We are 4 minutes away from take off and I can't freaking wait. I put those delicious slices into the toaster oven and set my timer. Back to coffee. By now the water has been heated and the beans ground, I slowly pour over and then....  I wait. It's almost go-time for bagel, so I'm rifling through my fridge and... YESSS!!! Miyoko's scallion cream cheese in ABUNDANCE. Now, it's getting serious. Out comes the vegan cream cheese, sprouts, cucumbers, and Cholula (hot sauce, baby). *ding!* bagel is READY!  I've got 30 seconds tops to get this bagel assembled. No one can stop me now! Plate, check, bagel, check, knife, check. And now, execution: thick layer of vegan cream cheese, check; layer of sliced cumber rounds, check; generous topping of sprouts, check; drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and add a dash of cholulua, check, check, CHECK! Press coffee, pour, run (speed walk, because really, hot coffee) to the kitchen table and DEVOUR.  It's absolute bliss. There's almost no time to even think about what's happening because it's all so good and I just can't EVEN! Feeling so grateful it's Saturday, so grateful for my bagel, and wondering if I need to get started on a second pot of coffee....   Plant-based foods are amazing!! I have been vegan/plant-based for over 15 years, and I'm still going strong. :) I would expect the word(s) ""plant-based"" to be very clearly marked, so as to differentiate between regular cream cheese and this vegan alternative. 

I also really like the idea of marketing with the understanding that this company has over 100 years of almond/farming-related experience, however what was listed in the previous slide felt rather long and wordy. I think it makes a lot of sense for Blue Diamond to get into the vegan cream cheese game. My first thought, however, is wondering whether or not the product would be creamy enough. My favorite cream cheeses are made primarily from cashews and coconut milk. Knowing that coconut/cashew milks are significantly creamier than almond milk, I feel like that would probably be the same case in a cream cheese? This wouldn't prevent me from trying out the product, but it would certainly be in the back of my mind and one of the main things that I'd be ""testing"" for. 

I think there's a big co-marketing opportunity between nut thins + cream cheese.... It would be especially amazing if Blue Diamond made gluten-free snack packs (like lunchables, but wayyyy healthier and hopefully with compostable packaging) that included nut thins, cream cheese. I would buy that in a heart beat!!!",Bagel 2.0,

I bought this a few months ago and it has become my favorite mode of transportation! I am barely driving anymore. It's so much fun to ride and it's saving me a ton of money on gas. This item represents my practicality and adventure seeking nature.

Item #2: This is a massage gun. Being an athlete, this works great to soothe my aches and pains. It represents my hard-working nature.

Item #3: These are are a couple of pairs of my hiking boots. I love to go hiking with friends and just unplug for a bit. These represent my love of the outdoors and commitment to staying fit.  Although I do like sweets and other junk food, I make sure that most of what I eat is healthy because food is a huge component of overall wellness.   I love trying new foods and I am not picky at all!  My biggest frustration is resisting the temptation to eat more unhealthy food than I should. Back when I worked in an office, there was always so much junk food around. And during the holidays, it is also very hard to avoid. Because I have a sweet tooth, it takes a lot of self control to stay away from all of these delicious things and focus on the healthy options. But I know that I will thank myself in the long run because I will age better and have fewer health problems if I eat well now. The last new product I saw in the grocery store was a product called Mike's Hot Honey. It's a kind of spicy honey made with chili peppers. It caught my eye because I love spicy foods but had never seen spicy honey in the store before (sometimes I make my own using hot sauce, though!). I couldn't resist buying it and I'm so glad I did - I've been using it on everything over the last few weeks. I will definitely be purchasing Mike's Hot Honey again in the future. I'm not sure exactly when I ate cream cheese for the first time, but it was probably when I was 3 or 4. As a kid, I often went to get bagels at a local bagel shop with my parents on weekend mornings after soccer games. That fun tradition made cream cheese stick in my mind and associate it with joyous memories. I remember especially liking the sweet cream cheese offered at my local bagel shop - I believe it was Maple Pecan. I am still more a fan of sweet cream cheese vs plain or savory today. If I was trying to persuade an alien to try cream cheese, I would describe it as a delicious spread that is known for being added to bagels, but also has many other uses including baking (cheesecake, brownies, etc.), dips, frosting, and more. It is available in a wide variety of flavors, both sweet and savory. It can provide a ton of flavor to even the most bland of foods. There is nothing else quite like cream cheese and it is a must try food item!  Cream cheese is quite flavorful and comes in a ton of different varieties   Cream cheese just takes good - plain and simple  I'm not sure how long this has been around, but this past fall was the first time I saw a Pumpkin Spice flavored cream cheese (from the Philadelphia brand) in stores. I am a fan of pumpkin spice in general, so I had to try it. I thought it was pretty good, but certainly not the best flavor they offer. But it was cool to see that even cream cheese is getting the pumpkin spice treatment! If I could make one change to cream cheese, I'd like to see a healthier version. I already buy reduced fat cream cheese, which is a step in the right direction, but it would also be cool to see a version higher in protein. Then I would feel like cream cheese has more health benefits.  The occasion I enjoy the most is using cream cheese to make a cheesecake. This is a project my wife and I like to do together, and we usually only make cheesecake 4-5 times a year. We most often make cheesecakes around the holidays for family and friends' parties. Cream cheese is obviously a key ingredient in cheesecake, and we find that a brick of plain Philadelphia cheese cream does quite well. Though I do use other brands on occasion.  I have tried plant-based cream cheese a few times, but I'm not overly familiar with it. I do like the idea, however, because I try to follow a mostly vegetarian diet in terms of not eating meat. I am just starting to think about limiting my dairy intake as well, and I'd totally be willing to use plant-based cream cheese in place of the dairy version if the taste was comprable. I would want to read the full nutrition label/ingredients list to see what's in it, and see the fat/sugar/sodium/calorie content. Yes, I do think it makes sense for Almond Breeze to launch a cream cheese. Since they already make milk and yogurt (and probably some other products as well that I am not familiar with), it seems logical to expand to cream cheese. I don't think this would necessarily change my perceptions of plant-based cream cheese since I am already very open to it.",Bagel 2.0,

We love krafts Mac and cheese in this house but when i saw this and read the ingredients compared to Kraft I was pleasantly surprised. And there are a variety of flavors and they are all delicious. My sister, while in college, used to work in a bagel shop. I was pretty young, we are 7 years  apart, and she would bring home bagels every time she worked. She had me try a bagel with cream cheese for the first time. I think what makes cream cheese special is it has almost this sweet taste that allows it to work with a variety of foods; bagels, salmon, cheesecake, etc. I would sell it on its versatility. This is a food that can be used on and in so much. I would describe the taste as a sweet cheese and the texture as a fluffy cream.  Again, I think the taste is strong enough that even if you mix it in a dish you can still taste it but it’s not overpowering   finally it’s just easy. Easy to store, easy to use. Doesn’t go bad quickly like other cheeses.  I haven’t seen anything new recently. I have seen new recipes with cream cheese used. One being a creamy pasta that is on my list to try. Heath wise I think it’s pretty good. I know it’s low in lactose which is great because I’m lactose intolerant but it does still effect me. I would love it if that could be improved. I still have to take a lactaid pill before consuming any amount of cream cheese.  the occasion is a friends birthday back in college, I am baking with my best friend, she found the cheesecake cupcake recipe online. This was prior to me knowing I was lactose intolerant. We are in my kitchen. I had never had cheesecake before and she told me how delicious she thought these were, that I had to try it. So we baked mini ones and they were absolutely delicious. I must of had ten in five minutes. Well I got super sick and it didn’t stop me from making them again a few weeks later. They were delicious and creamy and the perfect dessert piece. We make them in foil cupcake liners and topped them with cherry glaze and fresh cherries. They not only tasted great they liked it. The cream cheese is the main ingredient, it gives all the flavor and texture.  In general I’m a little skeptical on flavor. We have tried a few products. We cut back on red meat so we’ve tried a few plant based ones. Since we’re lactose intolerant we’ve tried a few plant based cheeses. There have been a few that tate good but I still prefer the taste of the real cheese. I’d love to find a plant based one and cut back on dairy as much as I can. I’ve read that some plant based items have a lot of unnecessary add ins to make it look like it’s non plant based counterpart and the result is the plant based item isn’t as healthy as “plant based” implies so I guess I would want to know that the product I am buying is in fact healthier than the dairy version.

409785,Christopher,Butterworth,chris.butterworthusa@icloud.com,"Hi I’m Chris, a husband, father, musician, songwriter and photographer with a love of all things art and a passion for kindness.   I have a number of food intolerances due to a medical condition, which have only worsened as I have grown older. I used to cope with this by cooking separately for myself and Tammy if she didn’t like what was on the menu for my limited diet. But all that changed when we had children and time became increasingly limited. It took me a little while to find my rhythm but I now see my approach to food for the family now as the art of the possible. Finding new ways to change familiar meals so that we can all enjoy the same thing is fun. Looking for new products and recipes to try to see what we like and what we don’t. Also finding all of the possibilities to adapt meals in different ways so that we can enjoy different aspects of the same food.   Ensuring the sustainability of everything we use in this world is extremely important. Where possible we are trying to do this with the food that we eat and the packaging that it arrives in.  Finding something that feels like a good choice, both good for me and good for the environment. Often products are either too heavily packaged, in non recyclable packaging (or it is recyclable but our area doesn’t recycle it) or its reasonably packaged but it is something that I cannot eat due to my dietary restrictions. I find that looking for something new to enjoy while treading this tightrope can be time consuming and infuriating. It does sometimes have a limiting effect on my approach to trying new food quickly. Unless its a brand I trust or a recommendation from a friend it can take me a while to research something before I am comfortable with it. Impulse buying with new food products doesn’t usually happen for me. I’m not sure if this strictly applies, but the last time I got really excited was just a few weeks ago with imperfect foods. It’s something I had thought about trying for a while due to the sustainable approach they take and their fight against food waste. It felt like  a really good fit for me, but what really tipped it for me was a recommendation from a friend who had been using them for a few month and had nothing but positive things to say. 

I was excited because I could order fresh food that would otherwise go to waste and customize my order and include all of my dietary requirements to ensure we never receive anything that I cannot eat. We have received four orders so far and it is actually quite exciting when each one arrives. The fresh produce may be ‘ugly’ but it tastes fantastic. 

They also sent to us a new product (new to us anyway) called Hodo, which is flavored TOFU cubes. I was impressed because as promised it matched all of my dietary requirements which was great. I wasn’t convinced at first as I have always flavored TOFU myself but everyone loved it, including me! It’s a huge hit in my house so needless to say we will be ordering it again. I’m not sue if this is one memory or a collection of memories now but its a powerful first memory of cream cheese. On my birthday when I was very young my family would always get together for a special birthday dinner. It was always a buffet style dinner that my mom would spend along time lovingly preparing, full of sweet treats, large sandwiches and many special favorites that all of us loved. Back then my condition hadn’t fully developed so we were unaware of the many intolerances that I have and how they would later effect me so I was free to enjoy food without worry. 

My mom would always prepare one special thing for me. It seems silly thinking about it now but it was something we only had on birthdays, she would make cream cheese spread on RITZ crackers, some with and some without other toppings. I think that I can still that remember the first birthday that she made these. I can’t remember exactly how old I was but I remember being extremely happy (it was my birthday after all). My whole family were there to celebrate and I discovered my new absolute favorite food. It was the crunch of the cracker and the cold, creamy, cheesy texture of the cream cheese that I remember the most. The way the cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and the flavor was just so intense. I was hooked. I told my mom how incredible they were and then every year after that she made them for me, without fail. I make them in exactly the same way for my children now, whenever they want. My mom still makes them for me on Birthdays, even though she knows I can’t eat them anymore “just in case” as she always tells me. Hello Alien, thank you for visiting Earth. While you are here there is something you really must try. It’s called Cream Cheese and its wonderful, versatile and delicious. Make sure that you try a good one though because there are many different versions here on Earth. 

A really good one hooks you first with the cheesy aroma, which you notice as soon as you open it. It hints at the flavor to come. It’s thick and pleasing to the eye and you can tell how creamy it will be as soon as you put knife or spoons into it. You can eat it on its own bit its better, in my opinion, when its spread liberally on something else, like a bagel or a cracker. The taste is even creamier then you imagined it would be from its appearance. It’s rich and thick and smooth and it improves the flavor of everything that its eaten with. You may not know what cheese tastes like yet but trust me, you are going to love it, and in this creamy form its mind blowingly good. A good enough reason alone to bring more of your Alien friends here and share your advanced technology with the people of Earth. A great deal I am sure you will agree.  Thick and creamy just go together and its what I think about with cream cheese. A good cream cheese is thick when you spread it yet also smooth.   Smooth just feels right to me when thinking about cream cheese. It describes the way it feels, looks and tastes.  On a general note there seems to be more plant based cheeses and cream cheeses coming online lately, as seems to be the trend with more plant based food substitutes in general. This is great news for me. I am still looking for a suitable vegan or plant based cream cheese that the whole family enjoys so that we can switch. For me there is one easy win here. I cannot have dairy. I am looking for a dairy free, great tasting, thick, creamy and smooth cream cheese that I can have and that my whole family will love also. If anything was possible and they could have everything they love now, but I could enjoy it too that would be perfect. If I can switch us all over then its not just better for me but potentially better from a sustainability point of view too, which is a win win. So far this hasn’t worked out but I live in hope. If there was also a health benefit that came with switching then that would be even better.  The occasion I enjoy the most is making glazing for pancakes- it holds really special memories of a big time in our lives. When we first moved to the USA my children had a great time experiencing new and different foods. One area where they struggled to find something that they could enjoy though- was desserts, everything tasted very different to what they were used to- things looked like their old favorites, but when they ate them, they were so disappointed. Food is one of those cultural things that roots you in a place, lets you feel settled and part of something- they just could not find their thing. That is until we discovered warm fluffy pancakes with a cream cheese filled glaze- you could see that moment in their eyes, their shoulders relaxed, their pupils dilated, and they were happy. As parents this made us happy, the pressure of relocating a family is huge- everything is new, and with this we had found something they could connect to, and bridge both of their worlds. So this is now for me the occasion I enjoy the most- it still brings the same response in the boys, the relaxing shoulders, broad smile, and that sparkle in their eyes- and this fills my heart with joy. So any time they need a reward- this is a go to, and any time they miss grandparents- this is a go to. I enjoy this the most for the pure emotion, relief, new sense of everything is going to be ok- it’s pretty huge really.  When we do this now- before I guess we feel kind of normal, during though- the moment the taste and senses come alive- we feel a whole lot of special! An indulgence, a moment of reconnection to what we know, we find ourselves. After, I think we feel more rooted- like we can take on the next epic challenge, I mean if we can move our family to a new country and find our way, and be filled with joy- we can do anything really. So I think it brings a renewal of energy.  How to make it better- I might do it more if it felt less ‘indulgent’- I have a good focus on healthy nutrition, and this steps more to the side of treat. A way to make it feel healthier, but still taste just the same (big ask I know)- that would make it something I would see benefit in.  I loves plant based foods. For the most part they are healthy, tasty and better for the environment than their animal based counterparts. Along with my restrictive diets I am also a vegetarian and so is my eldest son. My wife and youngest son are not but as I do most of the cooking in our house it give me the opportunity to play around a lot with plant based foods as a replacement for meat within meals. As a family we drink a lot of cows milk and almond milk. We have dairy yogurts and non dairy yogurts. We eat a lot or meat replacements like Quorn and impossible as well as a lot of tofu, but I also cook meat and fish a couple of times a week for my wife and youngest son. It used to be a lot more often but over time I have managed to cut it down by a lot! It was a difficult decision to pick just three things from the last task. I do like products that are either made locally or that are made in the USA, purely from a sustainability and environmental standpoint. The less a product has needed to be shipped, including its supply chain and its packaging, the better I feel when buying it and the more likely I am to make it a regular part of my household staples. From the information in the previous task regarding almonds, and assuming this will be almond based, I liked the information regarding California almonds and working with almond producers for over 100 years. I do know that Almond farming is very water intensive though so information about how this water usage is offset or made better for the environment would be very welcome as being upfront about this would really set my mind at ease. 

On a slightly different note it would be nice to perhaps have some tasting notes or at least a hint about what to expect from the flavor/texture as it is completely new. This would help me to maker a decision when I picked the product up and reassure me that I am buying something new but also familiar. Lastly I think maybe a link to or perhaps some information about what this product tastes best with. What recipes it has been tried in and worked really well with. I love to go online after I have purchased something new and either find a recipe to use it with or find a forum where people discuss what they have done with it. ",Bagel 2.0,
,Sachie,Uchimaru,suchimaru@gmail.com,"Opinionated, take-care-of-business fierce mama who loves to have fun with friends and family. I think I would be a Gouda-- somewhat hard on the exterior, then a little soft on the inside but not toooo much of a softie. I am versatile, I go from dive bars to glamming it up at fancy cocktail parties with the rich people. Generally people tend to like me, not too many people dislike me (or so I'm told!) I am useful, I can be used in a pinch to take care of things like being a major player on a cheeseboard or organizing a quick playdate. I'm also pretty affordable- I'm not a $30 a hunk kind of cheese gal, I am easily appeased by not fancy things in life like Goodwill finds and In-n-out. I buy a lot of Cheddar in our house because it is so versatile. Goes well with wine for adults, but not too expensive so an easy snack for kids with crackers. We like this brand because it is local to our area, and 2 year aged, meaning mild enough for kids but with more ""kick"" than a straight up Cheddar. I love how it is so flavorful and makes adults happy, as well as mild enough for kids to eat For adults it would be even nicer with more tang and kick The smell already is salty, and when you put it in your mouth you get bursts of salt crystals. I get literally goosebumps when I put this in my mouth and start chewing. I taste the salt, the cream, and a bit of tanginess it is a mozzarella which we often get because my husband likes to make pizza. I love it for tomato and mozzarella salad. I really like this brand because it ""looks"" italian--where mozzarella comes from, so I feel like it is ""authentic"" The creaminess I suppose packaging could be ""updated"" to be more modern. But I also do like the old School Italian look Smooth, feel the layers of the mozzarella coming apart in my mouth, mild, silky, taste the milk aftertaste This cheese company, Cowgirl creamery, is the all-out KING of cheese companies in San Francisco. You have this at your house for a cheese platter, your guests are immediately excited and impressed. And of all their cheeses, this one is their absolute crowd favorite. The stinkiest of them all. We get this when we want some joy in our lives The STINKINESS. More of it for less money. lol Immediately you smell fungus. In our mouth it liquifies. It's like fireworks in your mouth. The pungent smell is incredible. While the middle of the cheese melts immediately into liquid, the rind remains and rolls around on your tongue with its smell and saltiness. It is legendary. The king of kings. The truffle of cheeses The rind brie is absolutely the most tasty because it has the most intense flavor, cheddar has the salt crystals making it tasty, finally the mozzarella because while tasty, it is mildest Cheddar is the most versatile (grilled cheese, cheese platter, quesadillas), mozzarella being second up (pizza, salad), and the stinky cheese you can really only just enjoy with adults and wine Mild mozarrela is the most comforting especially because I can't think of a more comforting dish than mozzarella and tomato, cheddar is comforting because it feels familiar. The stinky cheese is not exactly comforting, it's stimulating and exhilarating. Gets my heart rate up!  Family dinner, weekday. My husband, me and our 2 boys, at home. On top of home cooked pizza 3 weeks ago. Fun, happy home cooked meal that boys love and my husband feels proud of. Feel fancy that we can home cook nice pizza, that we. don't order from a casual pizza restaurant. Boys literally scream ""yay!!!"" when my husband brings out the pizza with the bubbling mozzarella on top. A month ago, it made me proud that I was serving our kids such high quality and tasty meal. Friday night ""happy hour"" with my husband and I, at home, at balcony Another cheese, usually a brie or some other soft  cheese. And red wine. Today. Had a cheese platter with my husband after a long day of homeschooling and working from home, and then opened a bottle of wine to pair with it. Made us relax, bond over our joy of this cheese last week. They are clamoring that they are hungry. I put together a small snack platter of crackers, fruit and this cheese. I feel proud that they are eating high quality protein. And I like it because I can sneak some bites and it makes me happy too boys are also eating fruit and crackers",Bagel,ISFJ
,Lucja,Leonard,runningdutchie@hotmail.com,"Lucja is a fun and crazy person who loves adventure and will always say ‘yes’! Old Amsterdam-Wise but full of flavour and experience but perhaps not everyone’s taste :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: It's Dutch, and its a brand I am familiar with The flavor, It tastes so delicious, and it never fails to taste good. Could be even slightly older It has a sharp & tangy taste with a full body taste.  When you put it in your mouth it almost melts on your tongue and its sharpness hits you in the cheeks, like when you have a lemon, not quite that tangy but a definite draw in of the cheeks!  As you eat it, it continues to kind of melt in your mouth with a little bit of graininess.  It tastes like you are having a very rich and decadent treat. It's an old favorite, trust the brand. The flavor of the garlic and the herbs and the fact that it's spreadable. It could have an even stronger flavor.  It could come in another version that is firmer so you can do more with it to make it more versatile. Smooth and creamy, the type of cheese you can lick the spoon clean!  As you get a mouthful, your mouth fills with the garlicky herby taste, its creaminess fills your entire mouth and you are left with a delicious aftertaste that has you reaching for more.  It's so handy to have to just throw on a cracker as a snack or on toast to add flavor to scrambled eggs. I chose the cheese as its a staple in my salads, as for the brand I don't have a particular one that I stick to, as they all seem to taste very similar so I choose on price, as its an added extra to salad I go for the cheapest option available at the store. Because of its distinct sharp flavor it goes well in salads to make the salad amazing, or on pizzas etc but it's not a cheese you would eat on its own. If it was a flavored feta, like with chili, garlic, olive etc then you might use it as a stand alone cheese but the sharpness/saltiness would mean it would still be unlikely to be a cheese eaten just as a cheese. It has an unusual texture, almost rubbery in a way.  The cheese has a very tart and salty taste which on its own is very empowering, but when you eat it in a salad it balances out the flavors in the salad and actually brings out the flavor of the other ingredients like tomatoes and avocado especially. It leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste in the back of your throat. The Rypenar is a hands down favorite when I want a treat, but its expensive so its rationed, whereas the Boursin is also a treat but its more affordable as a staple in the fridge to treat whenever you want, and the feta is the least tasty but I use it a lot more than the other two. I use feta cheese pretty much every 2nd day in lunches and dinners as it adds flavor to so many different types of meals.  The boursin is also used regularly but more like once or twice a week as a snack. And the Rypenar stays good for a long time as its an old cheese and as its expensive it tends to be eaten maybe once a fortnight or once a month with a bottle of wine. The boursin is so creamy and easy to eat that its the most comforting as I can literally eat the whole pack if I'm feeling like getting the comfort from it, whereas the Rypenar is very rich and can be a bit overpowering if I was to eat the entire pack and the feta, well that's just not comforting at all!!!  It was in the year 2000, my husband, then boyfriend, and I had travelled from Australia to Europe and were in The Netherlands to visit my family who I hardly knew as we'd immigrated from there to Australia when I was only 5 years old.  We were sitting with my Aunty and Uncle around the kitchen bench table having a platter of cheeses and worst, along with drinking some red wine.  It was just such a lovely, family atmosphere where we were talking and catching up on so many years apart and the moment seemed to be made better by the delicious cheese. Cut into cubes as part of a platter I feel loved and part of a family.  It's comfortable and easy, which it never was or is with my own parents and I felt myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else. My aunty and uncle are listening to me and interested in what I had to say.  I felt happy, comfortable and accepted and like I could just sit there all night long eating that cheese and being in that moment forever. It was a happy moment in a tough year, 2020, so it felt like an escape from reality to be holed up in the lake house for the weekend just enjoying each others company and eating good food and drinking great drinks.  I felt relaxed and my anxiety disappeared.  I felt proud to be sharing a taste of The Netherlands and again the cheese opened up conversation and soon we found ourselves sharing stories from our time in The Netherlands and the entire family thing with my parents.  The cheese is like magic, breaking down barriers! It must have been in early 2000, I was working at the Ibis hotel in Sydney as a Duty Manager and we had 3 hotels linked together so there were 3 of us Duty Managers and for some reason we had planned to have a few drinks after work, shift ends at 11pm, so we all had to bring something.  It was me and 2 other guys around the same age as me, but I can't remember their names now. We had beers and crisps I felt grown up, I was only young, still just 20 and it was my first time working in a big city so it was an important job and time in my life.  So to be sitting around after work in Sydney looking out at Darling Harbour I felt like I'd made it! I felt pretty darned cool! My husband was away in China, after a big stressful search for Gobi (read 'Finding Gobi' to understand this situation and I was in Edinburgh, trying to keep everything together, there was so much going on with the whole Finding Gobi story that I was managing a hotel full time managing a team of 300 people whilst trying to manage social media and manage interviews and publicity requests about Finding Gobi, that I was getting close to a nervous breakdown.  I'd had a huge discussion with my husband on the phone where I broke down crying saying that I just couldn't do this anymore, I missed him so much and I felt like I had the world on my shoulders.  To cut a long story short, he said to quit my job and we can just focus on what needed to be done and worry about the rest in the new year, which would be 3 months later when he would finally be home.  I went to work that next day and quit my job!  Came home after buying the boursin, crackers, smoked oysters and wine and made myself a hot bubble bath and sat in there eating and drinking, soaking my troubles away with some tunes playing in the background.  I felt so relieved and 'saved', I was coming back from the abyss and could see the light at the end of the tunnel.I was so happy to just 'be'.  I felt like everything was going to be ok again.

,Abigail,Breslin,abbybres@yahoo.com,"Abigail is truly free-spirited, spontaneous, impulsive, and feels uncomfortable with routine. This is incredibly difficult to decide. My instinct is to say an herbed goat cheese. It’s a little more dynamic than your basic American, cheddar, mozzarella, and so on. The smooth creamy texture perhaps reflects my personality, as I’m very easy-going, calm, and happy. It’s nothing to sharp or spicy, but the added flavor is all you need to bring a smile to your face with every bite. I’d like to think I bring a smile to a lot of people’s faces, as I’m a people pleaser. I like Sargento’s string cheese the most! Best flavor and best stringyness (not a word haha) Like them as is! Not overpowering flavor, but also not bland. Tastes more high quality than most. I go for store brand for slices because I think they’re just as good. I love the taste of aged sharp white cheddar. Could be more slices in a package, or possibly thinner slices. Aged sharp white cheddar is bold but not daunting. The flavor blends well with sandwiches. I choose store brand for shredded cheese as well because it tastes just as good. I love the combination of these cheeses and the versatility. I like it as is! The taste is amazingly flavorful. All the cheeses go great together, and enhance your dish. Mexican blend is most flavorful, followed by aged white sharp cheddar. String cheese is least flavorful. For me, the slices are most versatile because of my eating preferences. Then the shredded cheese, and lastly string cheese which is really just for snacking. String cheese is easiest to eat by itself and FUN! Then the slices and lastly shredded because it requires more work.  Breakfast bacon egg and cheese melt it on top of a fried egg I use it every other day or so. I absolutely love the taste of bacon egg and cheese in the late morning after my coffee. It’s a great way to kick off my day feeling full and satisfied. There’s really nothing as enjoyable as a grilled cheese in my opinion. It’s simple, quick and delicious. I like to either dip it in tomato soup or ketchup *sorry haters* Game day nachos Maybe a beer or wine depending on the time My boyfriend and I made loaded BBQ pulled pork nachos for the Tennessee Titans football game. Homemade nachos are SO much better than restaurant nachos. We make sure each scoop tortilla chip has toppings and plenty of cheese. This was a new recipe and I wasn’t confident about it, but it’s officially one of my favorites. It’s amazing comfort food. It’s warm, ooey-gooey, and tasty as hell. No",Bagel,

It is a very tasty Mexican brand, in the USA I buy Joseph Farms. Its fresh and delicious taste. It is very expensive compared to similar ones. It melts in an exquisite way, giving a delicious consistency to the palate.

,Rose,Aiello,BIKRAMPHILE@GMAIL.COM,"My best friend would definitely say I'm a Foodie. We love cooking and going to restaurants. I'm also generous, loyal and sincere. I'd say that I am sharp Cheddar- memorable and very present. Polly-O is a trusted, familiar favorite. I really like the fresh taste and melting qualities It would be great if they had flavored versions, like garlic, spicy pepper or olive oil. It is light, clean, can be eaten alone or with tomato and fresh basil. Provolone is great for so many dishes. Boar's head is another trusted, familiar favorite. I love the light, nutty flavor. It tastes great on sandwiches because its flavor isn't too strong, but still present. I wish provolone melted a bit better It is nutty. slightly sweet and reminds me of Italian cuisine. Tillamook is a brand I have been using for a few years now and I am always interested in trying their new varieties since I have had so many great experiences with them, before. I have been eating this kind - chili pepper cheddar for about a year. I love cheddar for its sharp, pungent taste and the chili pepper adds a great kick. I wish this version came as sliced cheese for sandwiches and cheese plates. It is definitely powerful- the pungent cheddar coupled with the spicy chili pepper. I could eat this all by itself and easily, the whole block. The spice of the Chili Cheddar is really the most stand-alone flavor since it is so unique-it is the most unique flavor out of the 3. The mozzarella is definitely the most malleable, flavor-wise. This is because the flavor is very muted, so it can take on the flavors of whatever I am cooking, whereas the spicy cheddar has a very unique taste all on its own. The provolone is the happy medium. Mozzarella is the cheese I have been eating longest, since I was a little girl. Being of Italian heritage with parents that were not necessarily adventurous from a culinary standpoint, Polly-O mozzarella was always there.  Lasagna for dinner with my husband and kids I used mozzarella (and ricotta) as filler between the noodles. I felt comforted and like I was a young girl growing up again since this dish was one of my mother's specialties. I felt celebratory. I often make cheese plates, even aside from parties, but preparing one always makes me feel like we are having a party. Sandwiches for lunch with kids and husband Aside from the ingredients mentioned, nothing else. I feel content and satisfied- the sandwich feels elevated because of how well the ingredients play off each other. I feel comforted and nourished. Plus the sliced provolone makes this very easy to make. I am having coffee.",Bagel,ISFJ
,christian,blanchet,cb@christianblanchet.com,"They would describe me as a hard working, optimistic, overthinker. A sharp cheddar. Something with some bite, that isnt to soft but also isnt to hard. Can please any gathering of people and pairs well with  most other horderves. Aged Cheddar ( What i also call ""sharp Cheddar"" ) is a go to for snacking, adding to eggs, putting on a sandwich etc. I chose this particular brand because its from grass fed cows. I love the texture and back of the tongue bite it has. Its really hard to describe what could be better about a cheese flavor- i think for this particular brand the price is a bit steep at $9, $6 seems more reasonable. Each bite was initially like soft butter followed by a sharp bite at the end. An incredible combination and addictive taste. Manchego is a crowd pleaser in my family, and usually purchased for gatherings and special events. I chose the Fresh Market version as its hard to find a truly branded manchego and FM felt the most authentic. The sweet meets salty flavor it has as soon as you bite into it. I love that its "" aged 12 month"" makes me feel like is super authentic and wa cut from a big block of expensive cheese. at $25/lb this is a cheese that feels like it should be bought monthly and not weekly, i wish it was priced more affordably. Manchego comes out of the gate swinging- full sharp flavor from the start to the finish. Feta is used mostly for salads around my house, and I realized i am not overly brand loyal to any feta brand. This one seemed straight forward enough to try it. I did look at pricing across different fetas and they are all similarly priced so didnt need to differentiate there. I love how feta crumbles when you break it apart and how creamy and subtle it is when paired with a leafy green lettuce salad. Some feta brands come shipped in the brine , i couldnt find one at the store but i love the authenticity around cheese in its natural habitat. Feta takes a minute before the flavor arrives, sort of wet and soft nothingness and then a powerful full mouth type of flavor in the end. This list is based purely on in your face flavor. The most flavorful to the least flavorful. In my life, cheddar has the most uses and is usually the cheese thats always around. Feta is second most useful, and manchego is a rare buy and therefore not often used. this was tough- but because cheddar is so widely known and loved then is feels like it should be the most comforting. Manchego is more comforting than feta because i associate it with good times with family.  Personal moment- working from home, widning down the day and needing  a snack. I simply cut a few chunks and ate it without any accoutrements felt satisfying, like a proper end of the work day and a prelude to dinner in a couple of hours. It made me felt happy and excited to be gathering ( small gathering) with family. Dinner with my fiance just the salad which consists of arugula, feta, quinoa, olives, and tomatoes This is a regualr dinner time occurence, so it feels like a nice routine, one where i get to sit with my fiance, talk, eat healthy, and not overcomplicate things. I woke up late on a sunday, the snow was coming down outside, and I wanted to cook something more than just toast or cereal. The moment felt like there were no cares in the world other than chefing up a great breakfast. orange juice and coffee",Bagel,
,Lorena,Sarinana,lorenasarinana@gmail.com,"Lorena is a tranquil, caring, independent person with a big heart and thoughtfulness about others. Shy at the beginning especially with new people. Disciplined and hardworking. I would be a brie: It has a kind of hard shell surrounding with a gooey soft inside, best to be eaten warm. I might look serious or ""tough"" from the outside, but once you get to know me, you can see and meet the real me, the warm and caring part inside. Once you ""cut in"" you can enjoy me taking away the shyness that prevents me from talking and opening up. This is my go to snack during the week. I really dont mind the brand, I just buy what is available and low fat to make it a little bit healthier. I like the flavor and the easy way to pull apart each cheese string it might be a little too ""dense"" Im not sure if its because of the low fat? dense texture. Salty. Slightly soury taste. Kind of neutral ""El Trigal 8 month Manchego"" This is from Whole foods. I like this cheese as an appetizer combined with crackers or just as it is. It is packaged by Whole foods and I like that they have different sizes to choose from depending on how many people we need it for. Taste, texture and different ways to mix it and eat with dont know! love it creamy, touch of salt, kind of buttery, deliciousness, slightly nutty hint. It was among the Whole Foods selection. I picked this one because of price / size and presentation. It is the first time that I will try this brand. Im not familiar with this brand but I love Brie cheese. I love the texture, taste, and ways to combine it with crackers, marmalade etc. the ""crust"" could be a little bit less dry or hard strong smell when you open, soft, buttery, kind of sour touch, rough crust around cheese but eventually ""melts"" in your mouth. most tasty to me, I loved the manchego. by versatile I think that it is the most ways or different ways you can use a cheese. I think that there are more options on how to use or what to pair it with this way. the brie is fatty cheese that bring joy and warmth. The string cheese is not comforting at all haha  Snack between breakfast and lunch. Myself. Will eat this with some crackers, alone or with an apple or grapes snack between foods When Im hungry and dinner or lunch is still ""far"" away, I grab a quick cheese string and pair it with an apple or crackers or vegetables. It keeps me full, I believe it is a kind of healthy snack that combines protein, fat and fruit or vegetable. This is an easy warm breakfast that will keep me satisfied for the morning. I like the different way to eat it: hot and slightly melted. Appetizer before dinner with friends or family chorizo, crackers, pistachios, grapes warmth, happiness, appetizers are always great. Filled with laughter and lots of talking from friend and family. Great taste and great companion to the rest of the items on the platter. great lunch salad, made by me so I try to make it as healthy as possible. The cheese gives the salad a creamy warmth to enjoy with the rest of the lunch. salad: spinach, arugula, tomatoes, cashews etc.",Bagel,ISFJ
,Pavithra,Sivamani,psivamani@gmail.com,"Well my best friend usually calls me a crazy nut but that's usually reserved just for me ;-) If she had to describe me to someone else, I am guessing (also hoping) she'd say - Pavithra is an easy going person with high girl-next-door vibes, responsible and fun loving in equal amounts who is very passionate about things and people she loves. In short, sass and spice and everything that's nice! I think I'd be cream cheese because:

1) Goes with anything - Cream cheese is equally good on a bagel as it is on cheesecake, just like I generally get along well with most types of people.
2) Smooth - Cream cheese has this awesome smooth, melt in the mouth texture. And I can smooth talk my way out of most situations
3) Sweet or savory - Cream cheese is great as a dip or as frosting and I can be sweet or not as the situation demands
5) High fat or low fat - Most cream cheese is high fat but there are low fat spreadable versions as well, like the Laughing Cow wedges that I use. Depending on my mood, I can follow a low fat diet or a high fat one Two reasons: My kiddo loves to eat this by the slice as a snack. I have tried to give him other organic and non-organic brands but he likes only this. Second, it is a taste I carry from home and it is soul food for me. Back in India, we used to get these awesome roadside sandwiches. The inventor of the sandwich would never recognize them but they rocked. With flavors of spicy mint and cilantro and loaded with butter, potatoes and bell peppers, the highlight of this sandwich was the cheese (that would have melted into an ooey gooey goodness when toasted) and they all used Amul cheese - the most popular dairy brand in India. Every once in a while, I get a craving to make this for myself and nothing works as well as this cheese does. It is excellent in sandwiches and wraps, it melts so well! The taste of this cheese is enhanced 10x times when its melted. Sometimes, I even layer slices on top of pasta before baking it. We strictly only eat cheese that's free of animal enzymes and even if the package doesn't say microbial rennet, I'd go for it because of the legacy of the brand. Amul is a 60+ years co-operative moment with most of its factories in a predominantly vegetarian area and its products are mostly free of animal fats and enzymes the price. This costs almost $5 for 10 slices. I love everything else about this though I do not eat this very often as it is high fat Sharp and salty. The slices need chewing in its solid state but when melted, it is smooth and not stringy at all. Once melted, it doesn't mix in with the other veggies but stays on top as a layer I buy this exclusively for my kiddo for his pasta. He isn't a big fan of sandwiches or pizza yet but twice a week, he has pasta in tomato sauce and mac n' cheese. I make both the sauces from scratch and stir in the cheese at the end. I get either this brand or the Trader Joe's brand - both are organic and that's what I get for him I love that it blends so well with my sauces. Some of the other cheese like cheddar and even my Amul cheese makes the sauce grainy. This cream cheese makes it smooth and creamy. Personally, I like the flavored cream cheese like garlic and chives but I haven't found an organic version of it as yet. I've also used this cheese to make chocolate frosting once and it was the best and the easiest ever to make. Piped and held its shape beautifully! Once opened, it needs to be consumed fast else it goes bad. There have been many times that I've thrown it out mid way because it got spoilt. I wish they had mini sizes that would have been perfect for my needs. Smooth, creamy, a bit sweet The most important reason is it is low fat. It is only 1g of sat fat per wedge and is among the lowest fat I've seen among cheese. I also get this at a very good price from Costco The low fat doesn't affect the taste. It is still creamy, spreads really well and is pretty yummy! I use it in my sandwiches, soups, pasta sauce and sometimes as a snack, even an accompaniment to rotis and rice. I wish they had flavor variants. I've had the Boursin and Alouette garlic spreads and I love them but they are too high fat for me to eat on a weekday Smooth, Creamy, a tad salty Cream cheese is at the end because I prefer flavored variants. Amul comes second - while its awesome in a sandwich, it just doesn't cut it on its own. Laughing cow comes first because it is really creamy and smooth and I can even eat it as a snack. I like licking cream cheese off a spoon or even my fingers Amul comes last because I can't do much with it. Cream cheese comes first - It is as good in a sauce or a dip as in a cheesecake or frosting. Laughing cow is a very close contender for the first - except that it can't be used for sweet treats (I think, or at least I haven't used it) Like I said earlier, Amul is soul food and so contention levels are higher. This particular cream cheese, while it is great for the kiddo, is not my favorite. I don't use it too often. Lauging cow comes second by elimination  Just regular dinner on a weekday, with me and my husband. I had made something else for my kiddo as he isn't too fond of sandwiches Bread, layered with mint chutney, onions, bell peppers, potatoes and some spices. Top with a slice of cheese and another slice of bread and toast in a panini maker I generally avoid this sandwich on weekdays as this is a high fat cheese and will exceed my calorie counter macros. I always take a break in December though - the cold weather, festive season and the year coming to a close - makes me go wild with food! We had a major snow storm blowing outside and our mood and energy level was quite low, and made us a tad homesick. I needed something spicy and hot so I made this sandwich for dinner. It never fails to lift my spirits up. With a bit of ketchup on the side, it is a truly satisfying meal. Right before the Christmas break, we had story time during our class. And he was just not interested in sitting down, because to be fair, virtual story book time is not the same as a physical one. So I gave him some cheese to get him to sit and listen and he did! He was happy to have his snack, his teacher was happy to see him sit and I was relieved! in win for all. It was my birthday this year and I wanted to give some cake as a thank you to my friends who made a three course lunch for me. Thanks to Covid, we were not yet eating out so I made chocolate cake and I decided to use cream cheese to make the frosting. I am not very good at whipping heavy cream plus I love cream cheese frosting I had just finished my lunch and that included dessert that my friends had sent over - so I kept the cake for my dessert after dinner. It was my birthday, so I gobbled it up with a scoop of ice cream! I could have given my friends some store bought thank you gift. But I always feel that making something, putting my time and effort into something is a better reflection of my love and gratitude. The cake was a simple one, but the frosting jazzed it up totally! And to see them and their kids relish it really made my birthday a very happy one indeed. A reminder that in spite of the bleak times, we all have people who've got our backs I made this tonight for my son's dinner. There's not much to tell here because it's just home made regular dinner. But he does eat dinner quickly when I make mac and cheese and that's a relief for me. Plus it's just milk and butter and cheese so it's not exactly unhealthy for kids Nope, just the mac and cheese. I always feel he wakes up in the night for water when he has this for dinner, maybe because its due to the sodium levels in the cheese",Bagel,
,Rebecca,Schell,rebeccaschell503@gmail.com,"My best friend would probably describe me as the first person to suggest ordering some takeout or going to a new restaurant to try something new! I think I would be a smoked Gouda because I can be a little salty, and I sometimes have a protective shell around me, but really I'm a very friendly and get along well with just about anyone! Gouda is one of my favorite snacking cheeses, and the fancy cheese section at Wegmans always has decently priced, large slices. This is the only brand of gouda I could find, so there is no real brand loyalty here for me, it's just about the cheese. I love how gouda just goes with anything. It's melty enough to use mixed in with eggs in the morning for breakfast, can be grated and used as a salad topper, or just cubed up and eaten with apple slices or some pepperoni. It's even tasty enough to just nibble on it by itself. I don't love the sizes available for goudas at my supermarket. They are either huge chunks of cheese that are a little pricey, or they are tiny and only last a few days. Its a very mild flavor, maybe a bit like salty cheddar but not as sharp, with distinct nutty and creamy flavors. I was looking for Parmesan in the store, but ended up getting this BelGioioso Romano cheese because they were sold out of parm but I trust this brand enough that I was willing to make a substitution for my pasta dishes this week. I love how versatile this cheese is at adding flavor to a dish. It goes great sprinkled on top of veggies and pasta, or melted into a creamy sauce, and it adds a little kick of salt. I wish the flavor was a little bolder, I feel like it can sometimes get lost in the other ingredients and spices. It adds great texture, salt, and creaminess, but it's not very assertive flavor wise. It has a very funky smell, but the taste is quite salty and smooth and really reminds me of Italian cooking. I think my usual Parmesan choice is a little smoother and less sharp, but the romano is very similar and really steps a dish up with its salty flavor factor. Cream Cheese is really one of my favorite cheese variants out there, because I always know I'm getting a very spreadable and easy to bake with and cook with product that can be used in so many different ways. I tend to like the Philadelphia brand the best because I like all the different kinds of flavor options they offer, but I could only get to Trader Joe's today and had to go with what they had, which is by no means a bad cream cheese at all. I love how consistently good Trader Joe's is with all their products, and this cream cheese is no exception to that. As a New Yorker with great bagel options all around me, it's hard to go back to a regular plain cream cheese after you've had walnut raisin cream cheese or real scallion cream cheese at a local deli, so whenever I buy cream cheese I need it to be the best and most flavorful for it to even stand a chance against those fancy New York bagels. The creaminess, the spreadability, the subtly sweet but tangy taste I love to experiment and try new things on my bagels and am always hunting for the perfect cream cheese and topping combos, so I wish grocery stores had a wider range of flavors than just a veggie, a strawberry, and plain. It's so smooth and creamy, and there is a tartness, not quite sour but like a tangy tartness that I really enjoy. I choose 1. cream cheese 2. Gouda 3. Romano because I think the Romano is a bit smelly and kind of has a very salty cheesy flavor that by itself isn't always that appetizing until you start cooking  or using it with other things. Gouda has great flavor and goes well with a lot of things or just on it's own so it is second best. Cream cheese wins out because I just love how creamy and tart it is. It can be made sweeter or more savory easily, and eveen plain its still a super smooth, yummy treat. I put Romano first because it really is almost just like adding salt to a dish. Anywhere in your cooking that you need to add a dash of salt, you could also just add a bit of Romano and get the job done while adding some nice cheesy texture and subtle flavor. Next I put cream cheese because there are so many different things you could use it on. It could be a cheesecake, put on perogies, a bagel spread, made into a veggie dip, etc. It has really great range and a ton of flavor options to pick from giving it even more range. Lastly I put the gouda, because I don't usually really transform it in any kind of way or pair it with other things unless I'm building a charcuterie board with it. I like it well enough just cubed up on it's own, so it doesn't really need to be as versatile for me to enjoy it. I ordered the cheeses with Romano on top because I mostly use it when cooking Italian food, and nothing says comfort to me better than Italian food.  Next, I have gouda and cream cheese ranked tied for 2 and 3, because I really couldn't decide between the two. Gouda is a comforting cheese to turn to when you just have a craving for cheese because it does a great job meeting that craving and satisfying the inner cheese goblin. But cream cheese is a little more versatile and could be made into or baked into any number of very comforting dishes.  sharing the cheese cubes andGouda reminds me of being a kid  and bringing my lunch to school with a little snack pack of gouda cheese cubes and apple slices since gouda was an early favorite of mine. It reminds me of sitting around the cafeteria table with my friends chit chatting and sharing our snacks. My mom would cut up little cubes of cheese for me, and she made sure to leave the red wax on a few of the pieces because she knew i liked to peel thee wax off myself and play with it. The last time I used Gouda was for a Christmas charcuterie board I made for a small gathering of close friends in New York since none of us were able to get home for the holidays and see family due to the pandemic. It was so nice to get to share food and time with friends, and it is so fitting that my childhood lunchroom staple that I would share with my friends then was still something that was bringing me together with people now. This was such a warm, comforting moment of a cozy, lazy morning with a nice yummy plate of food and mug of coffee. It makes me think of chilly fall days where you just want to sleep in and stay inside all day, and you'll even use the ""wrong"" cheese in your omelette because you can't be bothered to go out into thee cold to go to the store. Dinner with friends where no one is trying to be fancy or show off, we just want rich, cheesy, yummy food and all gather around to make a hearty pasta dish with red sauce and a ton of cheese on top.

,Jesse,Costello,jcostello@gmail.com,"I'd like to think they'd say I'm quick-witted, generous, helpful and kind. If I was a cheese, I'd like to be an Italian truffle cheese. It's easy-going but with unexpected bursts of complex personality! Havarti is my favorite cheese to melt on top of other things. It melts well. The flavor is very mild, but that's not necessarily a bad thing A little buttery with maybe a faint hint of a nut; not dissimilar from Swiss cheese. I love goat cheese and this one in particular has an amazing, non-cloying sweetness to it. It's delicate while still being complex. It's very crumbly. If it sliced a little easier, I wouldn't complain. Incredibly creamy, tangy almost like yogurt and with a delicate, infused sweetness of honey. The combination of different cheese types offer a flavor profile that is difficult to accomplish in just one type of packaged cheese. The texture makes it a great companion to Shredding a mild cheddar to order tastes better, but this isn't terrible for a packaged, pre-shredded cheese. More salt-forward than most cheeses (from the queso blanco) with a mild bite from the sharp cheddar. Nothing beats the taste of the chèvre with honey, and although I like the other two, the shredded cheese is probably the one that's most about the texture instead of the taste. The shredded Mexican cheese is the most versatile because it melts into just about anything and the flavor profile is pretty mild, whereas the chèvre's honeyed, tangy sweetness must be carefully deployed into a dish. The Havarti is the most comforting because it makes me think of grilled cheese sandwiches, but the shredded cheese is just a staple.  Family lunch with my wife and daughter Making grilled cheese sandwiches on the cast iron Grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup is an amazing and comforting food combination, especially on cool days.

Ok for real now, if I were a cheese, I'd likely be a parmesan cheese crisp for its crunchy texture, is slightly cheese tang funkety funk taste that makes the tastebuds curious for more, and its versatility to ride solo as a snack or with others as a pair. I pick up Parmigiano reggiano / pecorino (interchangeably) when looking for a good charcuterie cheese –– and so I picked this one up. Admittedly, the brand (Primo) is not my usual (have been traveling on the road, so not getting my typical grocery haul), however I chose it because it looked high quality in comparison to the other brands available at Safeway. I love the immediate sharp taste – it's not a soft cheese, so it doesn't languor around in the mouth for too long, but it does have an immediate impact as soon as you try it, the sharp punch to it and it has a clean after taste. could be a little bit punchier in flavor, whether dialing up the sour/tang factor or adding some kind of interesting complementary taste (see last cheese). crumbly, sharp, scales the tongue in flavor immediately. Flavor is gone soon after, without having to worry about cheese breath too much. Feels like it pairs well with meats or dishes with strong flavors –– this cheese is a good ""accent"" cheese without stealing the show. Shaved parm is a staple – again, not my usual brand because I was on the road, but it's hard to go wrong on shaved parm. I liked the big, thin sliced shavings, so I went with this particular one from Primo. That I don't have to shave it myself, and the shavings that come in the pack are wide and thin (looks restaurant quality). Similar to my assessment above - it looks right and tastes right, it could get even more interesting though by upping the flavor factor. I guess it would make sense to just get a different kind of cheese for punchier flavor though, but I find that parmesan cheese is usually the go to for shaved cheese. Relatively faint, but satisfying when slightly melted and integrated in a dish (i.e. bolognese sauce) -- on the lighter side, not a heavy cheese. Taste is conducive for making room for main feature dishes, but adds nice texture (shavings). Picked up this Trader Joe's Asiago cheese with Rosemary and olive oil while on the road. I had forgotten that I really liked this cheese before, so I greeted it like an old friend :) Trader Joe's has a really robust array of cheeses, but I gravitate toward this one because it is softer than parm, but it has a nuttier/ tangier flavor; the rosemary cuts through the softness to make it still taste clean through the tang and creaminess, though, which I love. I couldn't think of much - I really enjoy as is! The texture of semi-soft cheese PLUS the rosemary flavor is delightful in its mix of textures and flavors. The softness feels balanced out by the clean sharp taste of rosemary on the back end. I've ordered it from Asiago > parm regg > parm shavings, because I think Asiago is the most bold in flavor. It has taken risk in its flavor (i.e. some people may not like asiago or rosemary) but that's what I like about it, that it's taken the risk. The latter two are what you'd expect parms to taste like. No deviation from the formula. Parm cheese and regg most versatile, the former can be used in so many different cooking variations (bruschetta, pasta, salads) and the regg can be used in several settings, whether grated into a dish or on its own charcuterie style. I put asiago last, since it has such specific flavor, it's best suited to be the main standalone feature, or along with something that has the same flavor profile (just like when you're trying to decide whether or not to wear those teal blue pants; do you make it the main stand out feature, or do you pair it with secondary hues so it can be the star of the outfit?) Parm cheese shavings come first, purely because it's a texture vice/habit. I once stumbled across a definition in Urbandictionary of self-care to be: ""Self-care is putting absurd amounts of parmesan cheese on your spaghetti"". I tend to agree. Next is the Asiago, because of familiarity, I discovered it years ago and liked it, and so I go back to it. I put the regg last, because there is not anything too special about it -- many brands have their own regg and this one had nothing special about it in particular. Least comforting, just because its taste was generic though it was good.

,Dennis,Grant,grantden@gmail.com,"A very dynamic and creative individual with a sense of humor drier than forced heat radiators. I would have to say that there would be at least two cheeses that represent me that come to mind. The first would be a hard cheese such as cheddar. That would represent my sense of humor on both the receiving and giving end. I also tend to like the taste of cheddar cheese in my breakfast cuisine and on my sandwiches/burgers. Also I would say to tend to my more eccentric side I would blend yak cheese into the pot. It's still a hard cheese but when made in a softer form its earthy kind of like me. Once I'm comfortable and you get to know me I'm pretty personable and pleasant. I had it on a burger that I ordered at a restaurant in Chicago and when I asked about it, they told me it was this brand. Ever since then I've incorporated it into my burgers/sandwiches. I love the thick melt it provided over the burger. It surrounds the burger so you get a wonderful, gooey cheese pull when you bite in. I wish I could get it in slices. I'm not that most adept at cutting it nicely off the block. It has a sharp cheddar bite to it but very creamy notes. Not as nutty and dry as some of the other cheddars I've had but it retains the tastes notable to cheddar in general. Its a slightly tart after taste to it as well. I was looking for a better tasting pepper jack cheese that I was on my turkey burgers and just happened to try this out when at Trader Joes one day. I love the kick off the pepper jack and the way it melts over the turkey burgers. Turkey burgers are drier than red meat so that pepper jack really adds to the flavor. I wouldn't mind have this shredded to so I could use it on other meals. Also I think it could be a bit spicier. It a pretty soft cheese that light on the palette but the pepper jack is apparent fast. You can also taste the pepper jack afterwards but its not too overpowering to where the cheese is lost. I had this at work on an omelette for breakfast and I was hooked. I found that the exact brand they were using in the cafe that I got my omelette from was Trader Joes so I went to buy it and use it on my eggs as well. Its a very complimentary taste along with cheddar on my eggs. It tastes dry but flavorful enough that it doesn’t take away from the eggs and cheddar. I would like this seasoned with sriracha or some kick to it. It can be a sour taste if you eat this cheese by itself. Its pretty milky as far as consistency but dry in to the bite. It has a tart after taste that goes away fast. The best taste out these to me is the Cheddar because as it pertains to what I use it on at for it really brings out the elements of the meats and crackers I use it with. The feta has to be the most versatile because I can mix it with another cheese and get a totally different taste than if I were to use it by itself. The pepper jack would be the least because I really only use it on sandwiches and I wouldn’t eat it by itself. The cheddar is the heaviest of the cheeses I have and I associate comfort with heavy food or its body I suppose. The feta is the lightest so it's the least comforting on my list.  At home with a friend over watching the game and snacking on a spread with the cabot cheddar, some crackers and preserves. I cut it in small squares We were watching the NBA bubble games this fall and enjoying the series with Denver/Lakers. I had a good spread laid out on my glass table consisting of Cabot Cheddar, strawberry preserves and crackers. The game was pretty close so I didn't realize that by half time the plate was gone. I ordered a pizza for the second half to keep the feeding going. The last time I grilled a burger was about a month ago. It was pre-diet so I went all out and made my cheddar burgers along with a cocktaill I made using Hennessy and red wine.

,Sara,Belcaro,sara.belcaro@gmail.com,"Sara is great friend and is always here for me when I need her. The cheese that best represents me is brie.  Many people may say that I come across as a little tough or ""rough around the edges.""  But when you get to know me, you will see that I am really not tough but kind and loving.  Just like brie - hard on the outside but soft on the inside! Mozzarella is a great go to for cooking great Italian dishes, for when having guests or hosting a dinner party, or just looking for something to snack on.  This particular brand makes the mozzarella in thick slices which is so easy when cooking, making for a charcuterie board or for a quick snack.  Also, it is sliced in a way so that the cheese doesn't feel cheap, like sliced american cheese can feel. This cheese always tastes incredibly fresh, which I think is hard with mozzarella that is sold at wholesale.  For the longest time, I would only buy homemade small batch mozzarella and I find that this particular brand of mozzarella is just as good. I think there could be a bit more salt added to the cheese. The mozzarella tastes so light and delicate with a hint of sweetness.  With a touch of saltiness, the salty sweet combination make this mozzarella almost addicting. Cheddar is a staple in my house hold for taco night, salads, and to add to eggs or omelettes.  I chose this particular brand because I find that their extra sharp cheddar has a great bite to it.  Also, I love this cheddar because it tends to crumble more easily than other cheddars which is easier for what I am usually using it for. I love how this cheese can be used for so many different types of meals or snacks.  It is a great go to and I find that almost everyone likes cheddar.  It is the true crowd pleaser! I really love a strong cheese, so I would love if this cheddar had even more of a bite and a stronger flavor!  The more flavor, the better. The Adam's Reserve extra sharp cheddar cheese has a bold and nutty mild flavor.  It is incredibly pleasing and I find that it almost has a buttery feel to it. Parmigiano is a cheese I couldn't live without.  Growing up in an Italian American family, parmigiano is used in almost all of our dishes.  For parmigiano, I always choose freshly make from whichever market I am shopping at.  This particular time, I purchased the Fresh Market (specialty grocery store located in Gainesville, FL) parmigiano.  I choose this type of parmigiano more out of habit than anything because it is the type my mother always has purchased. This cheese I feel goes with absolutely everything.  Any dish that requires a cheese I believe can be substituted for parmigiano.  Although many people would disagree with me (I have been caught putting parmigiano on my tacos when I ran out of cheddar) I can't help but feel that it is the most versatile cheese. I always buy parmigiano on the rind and I was very disappointed to see that it was not included on this piece of cheese. This parmigiano is salty, sharp, and full of great flavor.  Every few bites, I get a bit more salt than others which I absolutely love. Mozzarella is just so comforting and almost like a treat that I have to make it the tastiest of them all.  The meals I cook which include mozzarella are a lot more indulgent and overall have the most flavor.  To choose between cheddar and parmigiano is hard, but I have to stay loyal to parmigiano and choose it second. Parmigiano can be used in so many different ways: salads, soups, sauces, with vegetables and meats, etc.  No cheese can match how parmigiano can be used in various meals in various ways and forms. As stated above, mozzarella is so thick, creamy, and incredibly comforting that it beats parmigiano and cheddar by a landslide.  There is nothing more comforting than chicken parmigiano (the name is deceiving!) or mozzarella with a piece of prosciutto.  Parmigiano came in second as I associate it with hot soups such as vegetable or chicken made in the winter when it is super cold outside (I add grated parmigiano to my soups).  When my fiancé and I first started dating, I decided that I needed to start cooking more for our date night.  One meal I would continuously make was chicken parmesan. I would love a thick slice of mozzarella on top of the chicken cutlet and melt the cheese.  Once the cheese was melted, I would pour tomato sauce on top to complete the meal! The last time I used this cheese in this cheesy moment, it made me feel like my fiance and I were creating a tradition that we would have with us forever.  A tradition that we could always come back to and would remind us of when we first started dating.  This particular night, we didn't have anything to do and just wanted to stay home and relax.  So we decided to cook our go to and make chicken parmesan.  Once the meal was ready, we sat down on our couch and slowly enjoyed the meal together. It brought me so much joy because it reminded me of growing up and what I would eat.  It also made me realize how much I take these moments for granted.  My fiance didn't grow up with the same type of food, and watching him experience it and fall in love with it made me realize how lucky I was to have it all my life. My first cheesy moment with cheddar is making tacos with my fiancé and his parents.  During the beginning of the pandemic, we were able to escape to Florida where his parents live and spend 6 weeks with them.  Spending 6 weeks in Florida with my future in-laws would have most likely never happened if it weren't for the situation.  During the 6 weeks, we would have all sorts of dinners together and spend all night talking, laughing, and just being with each other.  The one night my fiancé and I hosted his parent where we were staying, we decided to make tacos.  This ended up being one of the most memorable night of our trip. We love drinking this one specific brand of seltzer with our tacos - Topo Chico. This cheesy moment really made me connected with family, and showed me how much food can bring people together and bring so much value to the memory. This cheesy moment made me feel very independent!  I think everyone can relate to the first time they were a host and how it changes your perspective on how you view yourself.  It definitely gave me a boost of confidence and made me look forward to the next family gathering. Being it was the summer when this happened, we were sipping on sparkling rose.",Bagel,INFJ
,Lisa,Bache,lmvejar1987@gmail.com,"I'm an outgoing, adventure taking married mom of three who loves all things food. Hmm... I guess I would pick mozzarella cheese. I think mozzarella is a versatile cheese. I use it for a ton of dishes/appetizers. I would say I'm pretty comfortable being in a variety of situations, with a great mix of people. I love this cheese blend, I use it on everything, even foods that probably call for other types of cheeses, this will always be my favorite. I choose this brand for a few reasons, cheese is expensive, and the amount of cheese we use in our household is kind of crazy, so I found the Costco brand blend and loved it. The quality of cheeses this brand uses is delicious and its at a great price. The flavor and the way it melts. i use this on quesadillas, cheese enchiladas, tacos, grilled cheeses, omelets, stuffed pepper, nachos and many many more. The way it melt into the different foods really elevates the flavor. Honestly, I probably wouldn't change anything about these cheese. It is a bit on the oily side once melted, but overall a great cheese. since its a blend it definitely has a lot of flavor, I guess I would describe this as a rich flavor, this is a cheese I would use when I want the cheese to be one of the main ingredients in my dishes, an equal flavor to other ingredients. I love this brand because they have a variety of those hispanic cheeses that are on my fav dishes. Unfortunately Sprouts was out of the Queso Fresco that I get, but the panela is very similar in flavor. I love the flavor of course, But I love this cheese as a topping. I sprinkle this on corn, beans, even tacos occasionally and it adds a little extra texture to my meals. These cheeses don't really melt easily,  I wish they did. Also these cheese hold a lot of liquid, like a fresh mozzarella and they are so so messy. This has more of a creamy taste, with a sharp after taste. Its used as a topping, its usually sprinkled on dishes because it does have a strong flavor, which adds a lot to foods, but I wouldn't eat it by itself. I'm definitely a sucker for a good deal, especially in a house of five, plus a dog. Fortunately for my family, I will not sacrifice taste. Sprouts always has great quality items. There isn't much of a price difference in this cheese with other brands but once I find a brand I like, I usually stay pretty loyal to it. Cheddar cheese is all about the flavor. This is a cheese I can use on pretty much any dish in my household as well. I don't think our fridge ever goes without having either a block or bag of cheddar. Maybe a more competitive price, I feel like this is a pretty standard must have cheese so I wouldn't change much. I prefer the mild cheddar, and my husband prefers the sharp. I think the flavor for me is more of a complement for the foods its in. For example, a standard grilled cheese, you want to have the cheddar taste, but you also want to be able to taste the bread & avocado ( which we always include) in your sandwich. From left to right, it's the order of which I use the most. Same order. The blend definitely is the most versatile, and the panelo cheese really is only used on a handful of dishes, mostly the on what i would consider a side dish to my meal. Again, same order. I think my comfort foods are the ones I grew up with as a kid, which are cheese quesadillas, enchiladas & bean burritos. I went through a stage that these were the only dishes I would try out at restaurants. The blend works best on all these.  dinner, with my husband at home (most will be home memories right now) i mix it with white onion and bake it in mini flour tortillas smothered in enchilada sauce. a few weeks ago, my family had to make suggestions on what to make for dinner and It had been a while since I had made them. I had just bought a new organic enchilada sauce from Sprouts that I have been wanting to try so I popped out all the ingredients and started rolling the enchiladas. They are super easy to make but always messy. I usually have enchilada sauce everywhere bu the time I get to the second Tortola. My husband is from a little town outside of Boston so he didn’t grow up eating Mexican food. He is also extremely picky and extremely lactose intolerant so getting him to try new things is hard but when he moved out to Arizona for college he finally cracked and began trying tacos. When I met him I cooked tacos for him one night and once we moved in together he had me cook them every week. Sometimes he’d even invite his friends over just to try my cooking haha. So every time I cook tacos this is what I think about. It’s so funny to me that he lot only loves them so much but is so proud of my cooking of these basic and very simple tacos. weekend mornings with my family yes, usually we make bacon, potatoes, tortillas and coffee yesterday morning for breakfast I made exactly this meal. With three kids in the house at all very different ages, our house can turn into a zoo at times but even still we love having a big breakfast with each other, at least on the weekends. I usually put my three month old in her chair watching me cook, she’s a huge mamas girl right now, while my other daughter, husband and son are off doing something, usually walking the dog or running around the house playing hide and seek waiting for me to call them over. i think for a lot of people grilled cheese is a comfort food that you grow up with as a kid. My husband and I love eating this meal. My husband is also a super picky eater so when he’s in a no meat mood, this is the first idea that pops in my head. When we first started dating we used to go to this hipster cafe that serviced only grilled cheese, cereal and alcohol, I wish I could remember the name. But before I knew how picky he was we used to go there often on our dates. He knew he’d always have something he’d love to eat there. Really makes me laugh every time I think back to those grilled cheese meals. Avocado and some homemade fries",Bagel,
,Christopher,Butterworth,chris.butterworthusa@icloud.com,"He is kind and nice and will go out of his way to help others even if it inconveniences him. I think I would be a simple Wensleydale with cranberry. It’s nice, warm and creamy in your mouth and takes me home whenever I eat it. It’s like a familiar hug that lets you know everything is going to be ok. It’s hard to find non dairy cheese, especially one that tastes good. I trust this brand because they make a number of different ‘free from’ products and I have never been disappointed in any of them. It smells and tastes pretty close to dairy cheese. I can eat as much of it as I want without feeling bad and it works well when used in recepies. It doesn’t taste as strong as a dairy mild cheddar. The first taste is very smooth with a back note of coconut. It’s not a very intense taste and it does lack sharpness but it lasts for a long time which is good. It’s creamy/milky (Although it contains no milk) with a salty and nutty hint. Baby bel is a cheese I ate as a child and its one my kids love to grab as a snack. The packaging, the taste and the ease of use. It’s hard to say. It feels like its always been this way and always will. That said it always feels like there is an excess of packaging. I specifically would love a plant based BabyBel. Eating a baby bel instantly takes me back to my childhood, its not an interesting cheese but it is a reassuring one. A comfort cheese. The first thing you notice is the great smell when they are first unwrapped, its all part of the experience with a Baby bel, referring to the above question I guess that’s why they are packaged they way they are. I am always amazed that no matter where I am in relation to the kids in the house they can always tell when one has been opened. It tastes a little sweet and salty and is very creamy. It’s firm to bite into but soft and smooth in the mouth which is a great combination. Its just FETA, a lot of other brands add a lot of other things. This brand is convenient for us with nothing added to it. It’s FETA, its our go to indulgence. It’s perfect with Pizza, pasta, salad, burgers and just about everything. Again- having a non-dairy/plant based version of cheese with this taste and texture would be amazing. Crumbly, salty, zesty, tangy and slightly creamy Feta goodness. It’s the texture as much as the taste that makes this cheese soooo good. The way it falls apart in your mouth and unevenly distributes its flavor gives it the potential to surprise you a little each time you eat it. You also can have a tiny amount and it makes a big impact. The Feta is just the most tasty cheese by far, I cant eat much of it so when I have it I make sure I can really savor it. It’s the best cheese to accompany everything so its my first for taste. Baby bel is in second because it performs so well on its own, its just so much fun to grab and eat but also is so tasty with fruit. Real cheese still out preforms non dairy cheese on flavor in my opinion. In last place for flavor, but that doesn’t mean i don’t love the taste, because I do, is the Daiya. It’s just not quite as tasty as the other two. The flavor fades much faster. Feta just goes with everything, its a great accompaniment and improves whatever you put it with. The Daiya isn’t quite as versatile, it doesn’t melt quite as well but it can still be used with most dished. The flavor doesn’t always survive the cooking process though. The baby bel isn’t really very versatile in my opinion, its good to grab and go, or for the kids but I don’t do a lot else with is. I think for my particular circumstances it has to be ordered this way. The Daiya is top because I can eat as much of this as I want. When I need a comfort food I like to not be limited by the amount I can eat, so this cheese is perfect for me. The BabyBel is next because it reminds me of my childhood, its easy to eat and it takes no preparation at all. The feta is last in this list not because it is not a comforting food but because it is the one that I struggle to eat. I enjoy it but it does not treat me well.  When its just myself and Tammy, in the house on an evening. On hone made Pizza, melted along with other toppings. It was a couple of weeks ago. It had been a long and difficult week so we decided to make a pizza with all of our favorite things on, which of course included the Feta. The treat with this cheese begins with the preparation, tasting some while preparing it. For me letting a very small crumble piece melt in my mouth while I prepare the other ingredients.Then the smell as the cheese heats and melts and the anticipation grows. I cannot eat as much of this cheese as Tammy so we prepare the Pizza in two separate sections to make sure she can enjoy as much as she would like to. The real joy with this cheesey moment is all in the waiting and then the first bite. The first taste of the warm, soft and creamy feta makes the pizza. Without it the rest is just ordinary. I save this cheese for occasions when my work hints a block, when there is just something that I’m cannot get past and I need to get away from it for a quick moment of inspiration. It happened recently so I took myself away from everything and cut a very small section of Feta cheese from the block. I very deliberately closed my eyes, put the cheese in my mouth and then let it sit on my tongue for a short while and just allow it to release its flavor slowly. It’s a real cathartic moment of contemplation for me before returning to confront a problem Ive been struggling to overcome. It always helps!! Late evening snack on my own Nothing else needed. Amazing, its just the ultimate indulgence for me, it brings me so much joy for such a simple pleasure. It’s all about the ritual. The bread has to be just right, gluten free seeded is the best. I toast one side of the bread while I slice the cheese and chop a little bit of onion. Then when one side of the bread is right I remove it from the grill and apply a high quality tomato purée lightly to the un-toasted side, followed by the cheese and then the onion. Then back into the grill until the cheese is perfectly melted and the onion is warmed to perfection. After that all that’s left is to enjoy the perfect melty goodness, all alone, all to myself, except someone in the house has probably smelled the cheese melting.......... Family nights are a huge deal in our house but with our busy lives we can’t always have them as often as we would like. When we do have them they need to be perfect and just as important as the game we choose to play is the snacks we choose to eat. It’s the end of a really busy day and as a family we have all finished whatever craziness we had to do. Excitedly the kids will prepare the game while Tammy and myself prepare the snacks. There are crackers and chips, a few nuts and some grapes but the main feature without doubt is always the cheese. There are different kinds put out but the one I eat is the Daiya. I will nibble on some of the other snacks but I don’t really care so much about those, I’m here for the cheese. This is the one occasion where, once they have eaten their own cheese, the boys are happy to then snack on my non-dairy cheese - but only once they have finished all of their own cheese first. These moments fill me with happiness. The four of us sit around, talk, giggle, smile, play and create wonderful memories, all over several bowls of cheese. Often other snacks like Crackers, Chips, Sausage and occasionally wine or port.",Bagel,
